and on a drive approx 7 years old then its probably an accurate assessment
well , you have to try and see if it works fine for you
so it looks like i sideloaded it .
i 've used kate before , but the ftp app provided the session file with autenthication and all , and
it 's unrelated to the vm ; just on the system where you call adt-run
until ppl learn to go to basic living , there will be war thats true
it will not be optimized in any way .
please adapt that for your environment - specifically the password
what does apt-cache search openssh-server show ?
oh
i did
we enabled the adb lockscreen checking ... plars thought it was all fine server side for this ( needs a
i 'm running 15.04 with plasma 5.2 on old hp/amd 5200+ cpu and 6g ram and nvidia gpu and ma-audio
haha
and whether you are waiting for the second one
there 's only mvo 's branches which i 'll look at again now
and e : unable to correct problems , you have held broken packages .
if you 've *really* deleted libc-bin , you system may be utterly hosed . in a termina , try apt-get
so about 11mb give or take
so that 's actually a good thing : )
the spec says each env provider has a default block device source , and cites ebs volumes for aws .
push it to the branch please .
i am trying to upgrade ubuntu to 14.04 and learn more on how to use it
how do you try ?
how can i tell if i hit one of those ?
yes
ls | grep ++ outputs
if anyone every tells you that cookies are not on-topic slap them they need the shock to brink them back
rvr : hey , any news on the ofono silo ?
yea it 's fun because the package gives a dependency name , but does n't require you to install it
i guess it 's fresh
there appears to be a simple fix , but you just need a live usb/cd to boot into to do
that is a partition name . did you set a mountpoint too ?
there 's a bot watching the prs . it 'll see the $ $ merge $ $ , and check
because we 're representing it as a range , not individual ports
as soon as you think it 's something that you consider ready for broader testing , please tell me
so extend the $ or
is n't this bill 's bug ?
you really can
i only worked on it 4 hours yesterday .
having it have different deps on different arches sounds like more trouble than it 's worth , imo .
i 'll be fixing in the meantime : - )
does your additional drivers show other drivers in the list ?
do n't you ?
just a moment and i will report back .
almost there
though , if we do fix the beta bug , i 'll probably let glibc in on that respin anyway
so with the other one i have n't looked through all of it yet .
so about every 20 mins no matter what ?
try 'sudo strace -f -p $ ( pgrep smbd ) '
that sounds like a very wrong approach , you wo n't be able to put those on a livecd/flash drive
btw what do you think about the new destruction animation ?
the sooner you accept that and start addressing it , the quicker the problem will stop
while i have your attention : ) i have a question about unity 8 desktop end session .
oh margate also has a free art gallery , if you 're into art
so it does not help ?
oh , no . we just use lxappearance
i really cant see any evidence of requirement for those two deps in keystoneclient
ok , in that case your gcc5 branch my not be needed if we rebuild and land our two silos
no .
yes , before.leader should have been set , and unless we ran a resignleadership op it should still be set
yup always do that before each test-run
i also added some new comments , yes
what should i do next ?
it passed
ok , so please test the silo to your satisfaction , and when you 're ready i 'll manually change
check the system-settings app and see if you added online-accounts there
also it seems keyboard is n't working for me . is that expected ? or something i did wrong :
well , maybe , but i tried to access it from different places
there 's a few approaches that might be worthwhile , but none of them are fun . maybe try 14.04.1
which line fails ?
configure ?
no , his answer is helpful but it does n't really provide an immediate `` do this '' kind of
wth are you talking about , this has worked for the past 6 years
just my luck !
ok and do you have linux-signed-generic package installed
yeah , it happens sometime : -d
qml
when network manager is 'managing ' it runs a private instance of 'dnsmasq ' , a caching dns server ,
okay , good idea
though , i suppose we could also be smarter about retriggering in such cases ?
not all . omar is worried , but i still think he 's only seeing that one ( really bad
welcome
... so you want in your case of 'qmlscene ' , you want snapcraft to make a 'qmlscene.wrapper ' file
what path did you set ?
heh : ) for gce - i 'd say very low
q
the output is : ubuntu 14.04.3 lts \n \l
( as we did upload to rtm/14.09 directly )
ooh , that must be really new , because it has n't worked even a couple of months ago .
she 's just getting coffee , she 'll be back soon : )
have you already checked if it works with wine ?
sorry , i meant when you give a specific destination
that 's assuming -- setup-commands 'mount -o remount , rw / ' of course ( iow , cheating )
i guess the use of dget is not the right thing here
look for it after you do the update-initramfs and see what it is .
so i 've updated the slide for 1.25 to mention accepting positive and negative spaces , as well as subnet
i 'm editing tasks.ics with different permutations now to see what triggers it
yes , hello , what is your issue ?
no , but the linux-lts-utopic kernel in trusty is 3.16 , and the linux-lts-vivid kernel will be 3.19 ( and
i assume so , but that weirds me out because the ppa has been on my system for a while
yeah
yes , but i 've been posting suggestions that are n't being read either
i.e . do you have a gui that was installed with one of the desktop installation isos
i 'll check
i understand now what is the advantage
ok , i 'll do that .
ack . i will continue to work on my branch meanwhile .
but most normal drivers are just easy things that should be open
no - that is offtopic here
it 's proprietary software for my company that requires windows to run , i just need the phone to show
shall i just recreate that branch based on a clean patch ?
the dbus call probably just trigger a gsettings change
known_hosts inside the .ssh folder in a home dir
np you can create it later
it can depend on the make/model of pc too . some uefi implementation are very buggy
indeed , but it 's clearly the kind of laptop made with only windows in mind : (
so according to bug 1465829 this system-image breakage actually impacts the manufacturing process , like we feared this morning ?
gotcha
what problem are you seeing ?
strawman : filter to refs/heads/ only , and url-encode the rest .
but adding type=forking to the unit file does
reviewed
well i could build a script or something that checks the machines ip and notifies the other ones . so
i even tried unity -- replace
probably yes , but it might be easier to do it without extracting your hand
that makes sense : opening session egldemo
it is a little bit silly somewhere
i hope that helps . plus there are some tools the team is working on to make packaging up existing
oh .
done .
well , the only place i see that is in my laptop in its current state ; )
you 'll have to ask oxford for help ... i could n't install the dictionary either .
as much as we can expect untested fixes to work =/
help
you are missing half of the questions we ask you to get to know what is wrong to help you
my desk bro , my desk
most users discover this feature by accident : )
i did . it just takes me into an infinite loop of apt-get update an and apt-get upgrade
is the other tab non-private browsing ?
muon is the only software center i have installed
unknown , there 's a delay in autopkgtests right now due to some large backlog .
great : )
mate is a recent reincarnation i believe
but in any case , do we even want a libmirclient8 talking to a server released with libmirclient9 ?
the what ?
software is magic , right ?
yeah
my suggestion is to remove and reinstall golang on that machine ... maybe the installation got corrupted somehow
i can make a code change to remove it
use the recommanded driver then ?
; ) if you 're not in the same situation something for $ 60-100 off ebay would be worlds apart
yup
it may have a different name on your router as `` virtual servers '' or something
aye but big difference to users : )
the only negative impact i see is that partial upgrades will be broken in the meantime inside -proposed , and
errrrrrrrrrrrr , no . no unity = no unity services
how big ?
the result appears in the terminal with the dd command
the iso is not currpt
maybe ...
i do n't think # 1410113 should be marked as a duplicate and should be kept open
- spooky ! i was just about to ask you to try it
then waiting till december wo n't help you anyway
i plan on doing the tracker thing when the beta testing starts .
what was the url
if it 's not too much work to get the styling right , by all means
sfdisk can dump a partition table , and restore it , sgdisk can as well
me too .
that the scope didnt get qa before oing to the store ?
but to get the arm deb , well have to make a chroot , right ?
if i do not respond , just leave me message here ... i am in gmt+2 zone : )
my expection would be us doing just an async call and just take notice about the result later on as
well i would if they did n't appear to be stuck waiting on deps
thats what i meant when i started the discussion ; )
not necessarily , depends on the positioning policy
perhaps that comes back to your yaml-not-in-root question from ealier
hmm , i was wondering whether the bg color of the default view in catfish should be lighter
why is that vital for using ubuntu ? : )
i 'm hoping it does n't try to release-upgrade *from* 14.04 to some later version : d
ah , do the drives work *outside* the live cd ?
nope
maybe the # ubun tu-devel guys might know if thats inside kernel ?
for mir it 's hardwired to on
mirv : i am approving the silo , just wanted to have some feedback about this
probably somewhere like /usr/include/something-or-other/
ah , you can add the language bar to the chat window : )
no whatsapp
its the technic running in the background which draws your desktop
you *could* try `` renice '' , but on your own risk ! ! ! ! ! ! 111 !
right , that 's done via our sysadmins . they added noplay as well , which i hope was ok
but it wont ask me this in my laptop
for someone who is used to gui it can be
so this is only for 5.4 ... i will have to port it to 5.5
ubuntu is n't windows , it is linux
what else ?
sounds like a good choice to me
how can i test that the bug is fixed ?
only ? it is more than the ci dash
of course , if qml.v0 could be fixed to work , that 'd be even better . i do n't
sure , what do you need ?
i get that
you are even more devious than me ... : )
adt run works by pulling tests from the source tree @ revision
it hangs forever , and if i kill the test i see this
yes
also .cache/compizconfig-1
it could do with an update and it looks like downloads are gone ?
wait a s plz
this is my big side-project
as my paste above suggests , you might need even newer
at least you have some , it 's been nothing but clouds and rain here for the past 24 hours
yeah , because i pointed out the issue on # ubuntu-devel yesterday ... i 'm fine doing a review but
that 's why i ask for 60s and guarantee 30
look at haproxy.cfg it has the credentials in it
but internet was there , working just fine . is there an `` expected '' time that would happen ?
i 've cherry-picked several fixes for pacemaker/corosync
you dont have to close pidgin..
i just reinstalled mysql from aptitude
depends on how you want it to work .
i 'm purging the overlay ppa and seeing if the oxide crash happens since there is a new official version
ext4 is fine for what you want
can you land that if that 's cool please ?
we used to do that on the phone , back in phonedations days ... mvo ? ^
any problems with its usage ?
hm..
clarified the bug
we can base quiestion on ubuntu 14.04.2
would ask about it if it was n't off-topic
probably the best solution
dpkg -- audit says that coreutils needs configuration
sitting on 33 % . slideshow is still running
yay ; should be a handful of hours ?
yeah , i did that before
at least , chinese redirections seem to be fixed , no more 404 when going to cn.duc/en/* pages
fwiw i was confusing m.serialize ( ) with m.inspect ( ) . the latter being the line-by-line with a final
it 's lintian clean , the upstream hash checks out and packaging changes are minimal
352.30
i changed things a while back so that upgrade steps for the final version are run when you upgrade to
my hoster is ovh
iptables-restore < iptables-file ?
you may be best off , for now , creating a kvm / virtualbox / whatever machine and setting up
phone or desktop ?
what about security
try zgrep -h suspend /var/log/dmesg . *
ok : - (
unzip ~/.local/share/trash/*.zip -d /usr/share/sword
could be . might i suggest you test lxde ? sudp apt-get install lxde logout/choose lubuntu/lxde session/login
i did google , but the results were n't all that helpful .
then you did n't use rar , you used tar . what is the exact command you used to make
i do n't use gnome/unity , but the issues we 've dealt with seem to involve moving the $ home/.config
correct
ok
ls -al /etc/apache2/sites-available
and the council itself
.login probably
i know , qt-qml app development on ubuntu is way better than python-gtk . it 's just a dummy app
you can just navigate cdimage.ubuntu.com
if i 'm right
thats what you were talking about
it sounds like the new proposed kernels i saw are still of the original cycle ( 10-apr through 02-may )
so when you said `` yep. '' above , you were referring to `` yep , some other mechanism ''
according to `` pactl list '' the ports are set correctly , the volumes are at 100 % , nothing
+needed , or not done yet ?
how can i make the free partition , the first , via gparted then ?
agents tools are there , but not linked
for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run ; do sudo mount -b $ i /mnt $ i ; done
ok , so if theres no new version for his bank seems we will have to downgrade
go chat to # # networking
the same way you 'd connect via ipv4 only with an ipv6 address
ok , i can repro , investigating..
sure
the shell script code in /etc/grub.d/10_linux is what inserts the `` set linux_gfx_mode= ... ''
actually not , i 'll try right away
then it uses ubuntu-app-launch

sounds easy !

yeah , gh is confused and rb is n't helpful when it comes to renames
it wo n't start it if you do n't add it to the list of workers to run : )
lost in translation : ) what do you want me to do ?
but i 'm missing it ?
hm , you just told me you do n't need a region ?
so *something* should be testing the seenconfigchange sort of tests
the bits i splitted out in that one
this ca n't be a nusakan thing - cwayne does n't have nusakan access
it is a drop down menu
have you tested your hd for errors perhaps ?
even the encryption algorithm is known-weak . specifically , rc4 .

why not use the recommended drivers ?
no idea ... all the variables are set properly by im-config too right ?
im getting the date just fine here , friend
what 's the name of the ethernet device when in private_network ?

then why is everyone scared
if you do n't use eth0 , you need iftop -i followed by the interface you actually use
there are not many personal files , and it 'd be really enough for me to recover them first
maybe we can get it in before the new stuff kicks in
it does n't let me pick that disk

i 'm just reading all the comments now . it appears that dpm disapproved a similar change before
i can share whole ansible-celery playbook if you using ansible
how exactly does the pc crash
you also dont see the screenshots vanishing from the spread i guess ( leaving only the shadow ) ?
anything on the roadmap for juju integration ?
.
so for right now we just use whatever we 're given and if there 's a collision , we return
so with 1.4.4 everything is fine while with 1.5.0/1.5.1 it is n't ?
copy it to /usr/lib
yw !
no , same chipset but different firmware blob
yes , it started doing that quite recently
yes , maybe you and fwereade can have a critical bug party : )
just turn off secureboot , and fast boot
we can try , whats the trouble ?

then ?
what would you recommend as a starting point for getting into the guts to see what can be done about

there 's a display manager named sausage ?
why is sda4 ntfs also ?
i was just going to suggest rfkill . i do n't see mine in my pci list .
your installing via partner repo perhaps ?
help.ubuntu.com should get you started and moving , then you can focus on specific topics

working on it
we picked up a bag from lee rosy 's to keep us going for now
this a data partition to be mounted within ubuntu boot ?

yeah , i had planned to add support for actions , but i had n't gotten around to it yet
but how has the resolution of the boot screen , windows installation , and windows itself changed ?

that 's regarding silo 47 , i can rebuild it if you want
i 'm trying to build a shell script

whats wrong with your version right now ?
did you check if your iso downloads is not corrupted ?
so really the challenge is to get the ports forwarded and you already know teamspeak is working correctly ?

you just grab the latest image from the official downloads and do-release-upgrade -- devel on it

you could upgrade to 14.04lts ...
then you should ask the wine channel .
that was just there to indicate it was testing pass , but i officially set the silo to not testing
good questions to ask
so just returning the error is sufficient ? ok . i 'm already doing that anyway , i 'll just
sounds about right , i added them to the initramfs-tools/modules but that did n't make a difference .
how would i map it to a specific issue

yeah ( with other day being last week )

yup just be cautious do n't add things from untrusted sources
i can test a switch in tests/plugins/unity/indicators/indicatorsmanagertest.cpp

ah convenient !
i 'm trying to kis
asac what plugin ?
when it 's done , show me 'ls -lh /boot ' again
right , that 's certainly a fair concern , but it 's also a pretty common use case really

just in case he does n't feel like upgrading he wo n't be without support soon .
yes i can browse around on firefox and do n't get any issued apt-getting stuff . got the .deb from

and yet you 're on irc ... ; - )
good catch
same thing , unity8 is restarting ( probably a crash )
i was n't disagreeing with the bug : )

can i write it inside the script that i am executing so it would kill itself after a specific time
dpm : needs approval , though
yes . its not there.. its not in the stock ubuntu repos

but votes were not lost ?
first of all , i 'm assuming that since the webcam demo saves to a directory it does not display
i dont understand
and this worked fine in 14.10 - so it seems something in grub between 14.10 and 15.04 broke headless boot
some adapters involved ?
you can only upgrade to the next one . until you are on a lts , then you can upgrade
vlc will play music and videos : )
sudo nazadi
maybe it needs to charge fully so it gets calibrated or something
you can also try 'fix broken packages ' from grub recoverymode
yes , i believe that this one is fixed
it looks like this is pulling it from mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt
i have european timezone , i would wait and check your syslog tail a bit few days
do you have the `` ubuntu-touch '' meta-package installed as well ?
right
oh , thats ppisati land : )
the one i have in mind probably works better over irc , but i 'm fine with ho too
than you
i guess its possible
ah , i said i thought it did n't look right : )
can i send a screenshot about the results ?
i do n't own one .
you should maybe find channels relevant to that device , i do n't think this channel will be of much
ok i see it
i am using chromiun
ok , though i 'd seen core images when i checked the channel list the other day . cheers
size is an issue i would imagine .
did you get the email i sent the other day ?
so , do i push now ?
yes , right now i have like 10
look at the users home folder . that is where the configs are stored that dont get touched by apt-get
yes
certainly . have you pulled the app sources ?
i 'm not even sure if i have more but i could ry .
well , if it 's 15 , check 'journalctl -u ssh.service ' and see if it complains about anything
no real errors , just many connect/disconnecting on your wifi
sorry , missed that , yes . i mean unity8/qtmir boottest
headache tablet probably
what are you trying to accomplish
gvfs and nautilus should be able to mount mtp
they are so so many
i can send the patch however ...
righto
and changes to the kernel can cause problems with it . in the linux world , package managers and the
white_cat is actually mentioning you
i removed that some time ago though .
cool : )
lsb_release -a
i will show you .
so by the time we reach state /api we already know what 's needed
yeah i agree
you do n't put command in your authorized_keys
probably . its an old ass charm
normally f1 at purple ubuntu boot , should work
yeah upstream changed it to that : - )
nope , i was running ubuntu 14.04 and win 8.1 perfectly well .
i 'm in the process of filing a bug for it , should i continue ?
yes .
yep , you can land as soon as there are no deployment blockers ( eg . code on prod that
this one triggers the build attempt : 'adt-run -- unbuilt-tree= . -- - ssh -s adb ' adding -b does
how life up norff
ok , another question then : how should we determine api version ?
you mean documenting that you should do other stuff before stopping services/
i managed to install mdadm from the live session but i could n't install grub
policy would be `` ask the user '' ... which needs trusted-prompt integration
full-upgrade isnt even mentioned in the man page .
bingo .
are you going to have a beer or 2 this weekend after all this : d
^^
i actually have had this issue
looks good , did you change the api call for any reason ?
sudo apt-get build-dep package
hey , will you have that early buffer release in qtmir work ready to propose any time soon ?
x1 carbon
that 's why i suggested a foss driver . idk how to do it from outside
^ says so under chrootdirectory in sshd_config ( 5 )
because if not , /dev/sdx should n't really exist ...
does the setup.py declare any scripts ?
i 'm not entirely sure how to be honest .
maybe the one from ! manual
i usually try to avoid that sort of thing , but who knows : )
even 14.10 is out of life already
what is this version number 's granularity btw ? 1.4.0.0.2 ?
what should i do now ? ( :
it build in debian unstable/sid
this is what macslow|lunch 's been fighting these past weeks
for the last case we need the error
what am i looking for in sata options
accidently pressed the enter key before i can add the rest of the words .
and we ahve itemselector and optionselector , both crap
okay bootstrapping has started fingers crossed
i understand that , friend
as a quick test ?
having a few problems with the try ubuntu wanting me to log-in : d

desktop or desktop
danke , the iso tracker was not in `` re-building '' anymore so i guess that worked , waiting a
any way to force that version for indicator-sound ?
do connection attempts from the internal network succeed ?
right , it 's an rc image
ta
anyhow , now we know where things are , lets get on with fixing your issue .
can you boot to recovery console ?
hm , i did n't get any
yeah , and it 's very clear where the component is coming from , too
gotcha , that makes sense . and when you have something `` stuck '' like this you either have to
laters o/
yes , all .
that was done because i-dt disabled one-time alarms when they have been fired , and the clock app ui didnt
how do you see it 's crashed ?
haha
sure . opening the bugfix now
i 'm not messin with the vm anymore . the computer does n't like one of the kernels . i
or try to create a new user , test firefox from there
that 's what i 'm doing all the time this week , fixing kde ftbfs and autopkg tests
when most of the blockers are fixed
in the first tab 'available for all users ' is checked ?
i would have assumed all ubuntu images are hybrid 's
clearly
no , you have to use apt-build to build from the sources - it will download , and rebouild from
ah cool , so you 're picking out bits of files ?
thx ! i try now
i need it so yea .
it will likely be after sda , size of the device might help you find it .
no its an error , looking it up
if you ca n't find anything weird going on , i 'll test myself later and see if i can
can you play a video ?
do* a : ls /medcia/ $ user
oh ok , in that case there might just be something of your user configuration which has gone funny ...
the startubuntu section is going to be replaced by anything ?
even this pc that 's 7 yrs old now was slow to install
i 'm considering solutions to laban 's question
yeah , no idea what that was
how do you get that ?
that 's weird , because all changes in rtm are also synched to vivid
e.g . the catkin plugin
what about snappy list -- updates ?
yes , i 'm in london at a sprint right now .
enabling debug in greeeter was very helpful
how do i check whether it 's running
set for review maybe ?
i believe a look at ~/.xsession-errors is in your future
i have returned ... duh duh daahhh
would it not suffice to install reiserfsprogs ?
yes it worked
niceeee
actually the opposite - we want the information from `systemctl status nginx.service` because it actually spits the errors into there
where can a magnet link be added to transmission ?
ubuntu is setup to not be used with root on the gui .
and it 's home directory is /root
i mean to make use of the apt-cache search one
otherwise it 's just a terminal command source , destination and some options
after i changed move to mv it worked
you 're the first person to have this . the other user had an issue of mixed locales .
: d
i 've emailed you
there was another user with related problems ; although that turned out to be a fake usb flash storage that
can you show us `` parted /dev/sdx unit s print '' ?
but first , ota7 will have the additional and complete adaptivepagelayout api
depends which kernel 14.04 uses nowadays
and yes - reporting a ppa bug would just be great
i 'm hoping sergiusens knows
no worry , doing then ; )
try sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi & & sudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1
well at least you found it and can fix it : )
ok , can you reproduce easily ?
so where should i go from here
theoretically , if we have the proper drivers .
is there a way to have a eu and a us track lead -- assuming we find the volunteers
during my testing i saw the update-status hook fire before the start hook had run ( after install hook i
the reason i found the problem in the first place is that the sha256sum 's do n't match
however , you usually do n't need that strict a control set for outboudn traffic on an endpoint client machine
then ask the mint support channel to assist you
i 'll have to quiz you on that in more depth in a little while , hopefully see you here
did you install the fglrx package ?
there is a .yaml for this kind of thing , so i assume it is usable to find this issue
you sure ?
btw which version of xubunut you run ?
one question , when i connect to office one , there may be a whole protocol that is different from
sure
that was the first thing i tried . i also tried various combinations of the different things in /etc/default/grub .
sandisk
oh , they are indeed about the same age . but systemd aims to do far more , so is
have you rebooted ?
yes , eventually
so *maybe* this means that the basic journal data it picked up
in g+ ?
so iirc the old issue was that the version of usb modeswitch died and left you in the usb data
i know the files are online ... trouble is they 're not listed in the release file
if you 're on a phone ... i assume you 're using our vivid release plus the stable-phone-overlay ?
aye , just a very simple one so i can get the results and actually go through the process to
ok , the same thing as what i would propose , let 's fasttrack it
it 's bad because any of our system processes that use qnetwork inherit a backend nm bearer plugin that creates
you just made your own mess
probably , yeah
i can . where is your xmir package ? and what x app should i run ?
hm . i probably have the same issue . got a disk with som old folders on it . ca
tell me more
whats the host os ?
sure , i 'm being facetious - seeing a lot of google errors today .
running anything *on* wily is just pointless here
well it reads better for one
some guy fixed that by removing all of his ~/ . * files . is that unacceptable for you ?
for what ? to run an apt command ?
regardless , you can use *any* burning software to burn any iso image to whatever media
so you should be on the 3.19 kernel
yeah , that 's probably it
add more ram
alright , now wait and see
when i went to unsubscribe , i had to log in
installing it was an effort , there was corruption , some text did n't appear but hovering over buttons made
actually `` today '' in utc ...
boot-repair is a live-media os
resubmit . anastasiamac passed after the size incread
hi
i 've added your thoughts to the card
what version of ubuntu , and what version of mysql ( run mysql -v )
and then re-bootstrap and attach just the machine-0.log when you reproduce the issue
as if there was a reason for it ; )
thats why it will suit into # ubuntu-offtopic
is windows-live.provider or login.live.com.conf still useful ?
there is definitely something screwy going on here . because i selected no to the initial asking of setting up
do you happen to have a mini 's -- get-selections at hand ?
look at the make and model line
i was able to set this up manually . the installer supports btrfs , lvm and luks but not luks
if it is ok , what is new url or working url to see updated ubuntu books ?
# ubuntu+1 for wily chat
ok
ask # debian : )
re-ask your issue , ubuntu version and paste here in chat
iow , if we have new machines it should be good to go
hm , just a thing worth noting - if you get a dual-landing silo , it will currently be blocked
do you know a method to make sure the image is hybrid/bootable ?
no problemo
looking at the header indeed no wonder licensecheck is confused , as it lists multiple possible licenses
i.e . if you need anything new it wo n't be based on 15.04 , maybe 15.04.1 or something
only basics : )
that screenshot looks like kde to me
get off with you and your logical thinking
this is kilo ?
we would not create a bridge for eth1.3
15.04 is installed !
so the oldest kernel is the -37 one .
how is sa , it is freezing here
i found its solution some time back but could n't find it now
the oem i 'm working with can only reproduce this on broadwell nuc and ultrabook .
thats the option thats going to give me recording sound at skype , i used to have that working
no , i do n't use sysroots for crossing .
ta
the *audio* tab is what i stated
so , assuming you have an environment with the juju-gui in it
i have no idea what zoops is , but on php scripts like wordpress , there is a configuration file
every file type i try to open from chrome gets redownloaded and the same does not happen in firefox
could be the bios is not allowing it.. could be safe boot.. or something the vendor did to lock it
yes
that 's plan b ... i hate doing clean installs where unnecessary
did you read his comment ?
i 'm just asking if you are trying some fresh install or if you did upgrade . anyway as ia
you can use the nearby app , maybe she will show up on your phone : p
and replaced the textual wi with the bug
the os is 386
i 'm sure the marketroids would brand your speech if possible
no . i mean some store in columbus at which cmaloney 's card number is being used .
and how was the node recognized by maas ?
they are required , in which sense ( backuping or otherwise ) is unknown
how about systemd 's journals ?
try with looping systemctl daemon-reload
not following . i 'm looking at the definition of listendpointsservicesresult , and its contents are an error , and
correct .
windows does , it 's called thunderbird
this is for by job btw , it 'll never have a real domain , it 'll always be local
oh , intersting , then i suppose its working fine then and it is just a problem with my crappy
go on , sru it , make it 4 .
what about silo 4 ?
i 'll sleep sound tonight then
congrats !
it looks like the settings get confused/shows the ui for the wrong pairing mode or something
happens to us all : )
still xsession-errors here
hmm , looks good now . but i wonder why ^ without packaging changes and with a mp upload ?
what would one do about that ?
it 's all about the 32bit packages again
sorry , i 'm not thinking correctly , on emoment
it 's not urgent raelly
i 'm not surprised : )
i thought i had explained this on the bug ; the scripts *are* being run in the correct order ,
on gnome or xfce : yes
why ? no , you should n't
from what to what ?
- > willcooke
just the two command lines , then it put everything in /usr
hmmm ... setting the range with the new api does n't *seem* to work
it 'll probably work fine
ah , it would be cool
i know right ? those 2 features together = love
ok , bfiller said he 'd attend it
: ' (
nothing since my suggestion about thumbnails
not yet i was waiting to push one
ah , to match yeah
ca n't hurt . maybe a slight variation on the workaround can get it going
good eyes , missed that
i do that to stop people wiping their systems accidentially by copying my commands without a though
yes , but why is it not installed ? also , pkexec is installed , and i 'm trying to
that 's good . no output is good for that .
i know this is `` wrong '' but it seems to workaround problems :
whatever you 're passing on the cmdline as console=
no , thats the file store
i would classify it as `` i do n't like it , but it works ''
mirv yeah ... that is the same exact bug that alf 's working
yeah - and python-jujuclient did n't have to change after the fix landed
not related to this branch , but do you think we need a different branch location widget for git repos
but what i meant is the function passed to seterrorfuncfor in testsetmemberserrorisnotfatal
wait a sec
?
eg . write new u-boot or .env when the oem snap updates or when the system image is updating
i 've got on my todo list to see about moving it to lxc
no , gtk side is already ported
yeah , or marking a few as `` featured '' in the admin , and showing those as the shortlist
yep
ah yeah , this user sounded to have it wrong
also design changed a lot , and changing anything on the component is a pain : (
cool ...
ah shut the fuck up u dick sucker
but found a bug for you then ; )
so , get the drivers from the chipset maker then , intel or nvidia or amd
there are some distro 's that do n't uses systemd
can we help you
if it 's reproducible i can do that and host it
i have n't updated tests yet , obviously .
i ca n't merge this yet , because there 's a bug in the test helpers on beagle . will
ok , type script remove.log
because a pre-dep would make sure upstart-bin unpacked and took over the files before upstart got a chance to purge
i 'm not too good on mobile specs , so is that price reasonable ?
yes , update brings you to 14.04.2
doookkoooo
i would be cautious . and keep in mind , data recovery is not trivial.. take your time and research
or maybe a fallback to main menu after the link ?
basically it 's a hook somewhere
now , it could be *simple*.. could be , the gpu drivers.. have you experiemented with other gpu drivers ?
it 's been a good week , actually got some work done !
is that a virtual system ?
it 's usually installed by default now , i believe . if it is missing `` sudo apt-get install pastebinit
annoyingly i 'm losing count of the number of fixes that have to all work together
we can drop it in l2
plug in usb , reboot , hit f12 ( or whatever takes you to one-time boot options ) , set
and make /boot bigger , lol
sure . if you need help , feel free to ping dholbach or myself
could be down for maintenance . it happens..
is the concern that the charm is failing auto charm testing but the mp is still accepted ?

the plan afaik is `` vivid > xfce-412 ppa for utopic > ppa for trusty > trusty srus as needed

it 's a stringified integer
there was nothing but people coming and going and me randomly coming and going for some odd reason
can you find it ?
tired , but good - the usual sprint things , too long evenings , very long days ...
i 'll be so happy when we finally get rid of jenkins
oh , come on , 0xdeadbeef is so good read- and understandable
it 's because the script could n't properly detect krillin
best way to verify if it 's maybe a client or site issue , is try to use the same
dda handles that , all touch-based
for apt-get update you mean ?
cat or tail and many others
i mean it 's up to you
did you enable wifi switch ?
is that you mythbuster-dude ?
whats so hard about going from 13.10 to 14.04
oh , right !
but again , i do n't think that 's cause for that error
could we by this way find a better name than just `` value '' ?
that is what i intend to

and my mental process was the one that daftykins described
does unity8 direct things from a surfaceitem perspective ? i thought u8 only cared about apps ?
oh well this time i 'm finally seeing a traceback in the logs
this may also help ; it 'll create the missing xorg.conf `` sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg ''
no problem ... good luck
a web tool to manage hosting stuff
sadly not
no , pastebin /boot/grub/grub.cfg
you have to ask me and i can do it
? ?
i thought that was the case .
oh ok , so we configure that coverage.xml path per-project ?
bash : /home/anon/desktop/tor-browser_en-us/star-tor-browser : no such file or directory anon @ ubuntu : ~ $
4.2.0-16-generic
there are proxies that are tailor made for this kind of filtering ( blocking of facebook , advertisements etc )
however , it 's almost always better to stick to the repos ( unless you absolutely have to have a
well , same : )
that 's fine , i should grab some lunch then : )
once that is done , try `` su dave '' twice again .
strangely - gnome keyring ( which i saw another report about )
he gets error when using krita , not with installing it .
working correctly - and probably was yesterday too
libunity-tool -g for the ui
then run lsusb
do you have x running ?
i 'll give a test to that shortly ...
i mean i have a bug which says it 's been uploaded to trusty-proposed , but i ca n't see
nice : )
not a good sign . good thing laptop memory is cheap
ben64 is telling you
i unplugged unplugging the 1080p nec , so no . i 'm using the thickest dvi cable i have for
make a new user and see if that one has the same problem .
have n't tried that.. what url should i use ?
lts does not upgrade to 15.04 , you have to go via 14.10 first .
s/apache/nginx then .
i dunno , which was kinda my point . they should get a cut for making the modder-tooling ( whatever
let me check with michelle first to see if there is the option to return to the fund , she
ack . so i did hud-like functionality before by implementating a qabstractvideosurface in a qquickitem
new dpkg arrived , could merge debhelper now ?
because ?
and kidle_inject what is this ?
wget -6 ?
if you mean kde 's reviewboard it 's out of scope
so i 'd check the keystone log files ( /var/log/keystone ) and anything in /var/log/apache ( on the dashboard unit
see comment # 6
you can boot to single user by editing the grub commandline before boot
yes i set it for the next change
boot flag doesnt mean anything in linux
yes , easy peasy
asked for it
i do n't mind having a /usr/bin/juju hanging around : )
is that a known issue ? otherwise what can we provide to help fix that ?
is it on the latest bios ?
ist not about amd
getting opinions regarding the proper fix from the uploader is fine ; but the policy to revert first when faced
citrain spreadsheet is `` temporary ''
totally
they provide updates over a static source compile , of course
next thing i 'd try is log in on a virtual console and run startx
insmod linux
the upgrade mechanics only run on the machine agents so the check for a unit tag in the upgrade step
go on
pong
did you get the here maps version working ?
the webchat from spotchat needs java , ca n't enter there : /
or lubuntu ... but that has a gui
sil2100 : landing on xenial ; vivid , we 're not part of the hotfix release
wrap in a .deb
some random combinations of base station and client adapter work better than others . try a few .
yes . i try to mount a share in the cli .
yeah , never sow something like that , only occurs with that theme ? or all themes ?
run `` sudo apt-get clean ; sudo apt-get autoremove ; '' - but take a close look on what the
also make sure you reboot the device
it will queue up in spi and run if/when things come back to life
you know about the trap function , right ?
ask david calle when he 's around . it 's his
ratbox and hybrid both enforce sasl now . talk to the admin . i 've had very good results with
then try again
run , sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get upgrade
ok , so make sure the caja mounts the drive correctly with gvfs
ah , well i suppose not .
interesting , sda1 has files for both ntldr ( from windows xp and below ) and bootmgr ( from vista+
ouhh ...
and i wo n't be treading on any toes by doing that ?
may be that i call clear un the playlist when is not connected to an audio that breaks the clearing
greyback_ 's been working on enabling all of that recently
alongside my previous operating system .
not good , try the other nvidia : p
i was working on it in the firefox code about 6 years ago , or more . the code was
and on 14.04 here and have a /etc/default/apache2 file so maybe that 's been moved/renamed
answer to second question is `` no '
but i do n't get why we do n't just make hybris wrap glgetstringi
yeah : )
if you click to join the network , then navigate to any webpage in the browser , you 'll prob
i 'm always there , just may be one of my many faces .
i do n't have no idea , but i can tell you one thing i 'm not near those servers
no problem : )
happy2help !
got it
so repository do n't have ppa ?
are you up for testing it ? : )
ok
ah , but that only happened recently , right ? so matsubara might have had an older init package that
i 'm using qt5.4 on vivid .
one moment , showing you an interesting log fragment
oh , install the nvidia-settings package too , run that and see if it offers anything . i do n't
if unity-api gets rebuilt without no-lifecycle for some reason
enabled usb mouse/keyboard in bios ?
at the grub menu your first line is the kernel starting the os . second line is access to others
this is what i used before
great , then i 'll go ahead and upload the l-s part .
i 've done that 4 times already . : (
will show your what arch your browser is
i 'm still reading the changelog
the transition from ubuntu 14.10 to 15.04 was seamless . no systemd issues that i 've encountered .
name
how did you install it ?
looks like
without*
no
do 'cat /etc/resolv.conf '
you see the usb stick in grub ?
the problem is rc.local gets executed before x so that way wo n't work
it would be an entirely different kettle of fish
ok
cool
did you set your phone to writable ?
do you have a paste or link of the error ?
debconf in the former case , cdebconf in the latter , then
i do n't , either : (
hmm , i enabled dri3 and nothing blew up . any way of confirming that it 's actually being used
it does on some packages , but not kernels . because , technically , they are still `` in use
sure thing
not in addons at all
look at the ms log on that bug
i 'm pretty sure i fixed everything i could yesterday
what should i expect with no_acpi ?
you 're self-effacing .
that was my hope ; - ) thnx for confirmation !
can you upgrade to 14.04 lts instead of 12.04 ?
if there 's an error reading files in your home folder ... something is up .
you just made a really good point . i don ' t have any important files there , maybe i
i 've also read that on some gma chipsets the backlight setting is inverted so when the operating system thinks
argh , should have added that . ubuntu-touch/rc-proposed/meizu.en r47 , but lots of people are also reporting it with stable
ive had it happen to me in 14.04
hmm ?
we 're on topic with robru about that
x.org was forked from xfree86 because xfree86 was not going anywhere , and some of the developers wanted development to
yeah
i do n't want all emails to /var/vmail , i want the email from admin @ example.com to be on
that to is created .
should show all their ips too so then try and hit those with a web browser assuming that thing has
like svetlana` suggested [ share ] with force user is a fine idea too
php
landed
oh , it 's possible that -core is not available in 14.04
well , wfm if you want , but being able to test locally would be convenient
windows bootloader will wipe out grub = reinstall
um , that looks right
lol depmod fails in the container
it seems the pm has n't reached me yet ?
note that the hwe stacks eol _before_ the original 14.04 stack -- so if you opt into them today ,
looks great to me .
this just makes me more adamant that it 's the leavy multienv stuff that is the problem
ok , cause it keeps passing here on wide-preview
it 's all of the `` blue-ness '' , is n't it ... ?
cool.. so , you can stop fiddling with the os , and drivers , and system settings..
try adding one of those boot params like `` backlight=vendor ''
eh ? ok ? 2gpu 's intel and nvidia i guess ?
maybe it is still deploying
i am using a flash drive ( usb key )
i meant dig @ 192.168.1.10 somelocal.host
yes : p
well , i 've filed bug # 1427264
ah i was unaware of that , was just sharing what worked for me : )
if/when i pick it up i 'll probably talk to you about it
i pushed a few hundred builds through it over the weekend , and identified a few issues that we need
it 's always good to have a backup . now you can remove the recovery partition and use the free
no , gnome is pretty heavy
like which game do you want ?
could well be . botnets or some such
awesome \o/
i recommend when you create it you back it up the .gnupg folder to a pendrive and store it somewhere
i came to the server last week . vlc was running at 99 % cpu . my pfsense box was
it runs after the build tree is gone
cd ..
think perhaps a regreesion to the 340 driver might be worth a try
yup
do you know of any charms that transfer *anything* via rsync ?
hm , my krillin rebooted pretty fast
qtquickapp == native application , qml app with c++ plugin == app using qmlscene loading a c++ plugin
1.9.4 is here , but osomon righfully suggested to get 1.9.3 published first , just to be sure we have
that 's offtopic now
it was commented out previously , and it was the same .
yes
congrats on your first landing : )
also , when i try to use fbi , it gives an error showing this : ioctl vt_getstate : inappropriate
if you 're not leaving just yet i 'll have 15.04 bootable in a bit and i 'll see where
ya i noticed apt was still updating it .
just the generic one that came with the pc years ago .
i do n't think it was that test that got changed
^
he wants to install certain apps in different directories
i was just looking at your blog re 4.12
change the `` /dev/sd ? '' bits with `` uuid=whateverthebigstreamoflettersis '' without the quotes
to split an if statement over multiple lines you do need brackets around it
can you pastebin the output ?
yes , but then you will lose all your metrics
we do have a fair bit of dkms packages , and apparently firefox/thunderbird backports which declare testsuite :
which is specified by grub
ubuntu-drivers list ?
got a laptop , only optimus cards available from nvidia
yeah . first i got `` version.h '' missing , and then i did make include/linux/version.h within the linux source
land to both vivid+xenial , worst case it will get stuck in xenial proposed again
pretty sure grub2 was around in 8.04
go for it
can you please give me a link or provide me with a cool kununtu banner ?
exactly . the new kernels and noveau fan problems if you know what i am saying .
if the problem persists it 's not samba
probably not
would n't it be better to just explain in the documentation how to use the function ?
no , i have never touched my terminal 's variables , but just in case , how do i restart
do you have a 'phone with bluetooth ? if so , try pairing it with the pc and tell me
iirc , compiling oss ( even as modules ) leaves some scaffolding in the kernel that makes it misbehave slightly
the very first step out of the link i gave you .
you okay with leaving the debug info in until we 're go for landing ?
cool , but also uncool . how long will we have to carry that patch ?
cherry-picking upstream patches or updating to the latest upstream release in ubuntu ahead of debian are both fine .
yes i can open in vim , it opens encrypted data but i am able to edit that : s
and pptpd is not secure anymore .
yes in godalming
so working on previous kernel or file a new bug are your choices
lying about api versions is n't nice
as `` for dir in dev sys proc ; do sudo mount -- bind / $ dir/ /mnt/ $ dir/
option z it is : )
ok , so you 're booted in the live usb right now ?
do you know if the free personal-run landscape can work with remote offsite servers ?
sorry , what command was that ?
we can discuss it .
it looks like gmx.com has decided to blacklist mx.launchpad.net .
since people report that old alarms are not working when people upgrade to ota-4 , new ones work fine
hey
but that 's fixed
maybe there is something wrong with gtk 3 libs .
just put it in /etc/rc.local before the `` exit 0 '' line
can you access the device that it just tried running on ?
m impressed with everyone 's multi-tasking ; - )
rock . then once i finish these notes , i will continue with the release of 1.22-beta1 , which is
: /
i 'll add comments
exactly , the a simple ssh would be no problem
so ideally , patch cmakelists.txt to take an arg to provide an alternate ~/.clogrc path
yes its x86 64
that 's most likely the same issue ( not found subnets : [ ] )
my hashes came from 14.04 ; i 'll check on 15.10 now
makes sense
fsckd to inactive/dead , the socket to active/listening
so the apps that came bundled with the phone will always be updated even if i remove them ?
the default profile plugin does n't use unity for mate
the only thing i can think of is the boot sector virus protection ; but nothing in bios can prevent
yeah , for approving yes - since those are simple formulas
you 'd have to create the full port yourself
unless you 're thinking of the ui for registering a code import
and ? that file is fine .
i have not , that would be exciting , was there anything new about this recently ? i thought there
but there is probably 1000 's of posts on the interwebs that describe it better than i did ; )
alright , fair enough , it works great for you , but for me its.. well , i 'll say
maybe some clue on the console ?
windows has tons of it . especially 10 .
that 's what the cool guys are doing now
maybe the chroot thing will fix it but it sounds like an overkill to me
well , then use it . you should be able to double-click any xz file and it will open in
the thing is that i need special permissions to copy some of the files
you 're talking about autopkgtest in vivid , right ?
provided it lands ok , can you trigger the ppc64 job manually to see if it worked and save time
in our current process we only do sanity testing for rtm for mako , emulator and krillin
i 'm confused you were using default-settings to depend on desktop packages ? why ?
going up ? we 've been going for 8 years
line50 'property bool bug1341671workaround : true ' and the comment above
newer kernel are bound to bugs . you could check the kernel log for errors
trunks are now up-to-date
awesome..
no , just the desktop effects in general .
yeah , wheverver the mx points must resolve
groovy , is there any additional assistance that might be required -- -if not would you be able to email
i used the system update to upgrade
juju.container.lxc does the same for the lxc commands
that 's true - so i would 've already proposed the `` hot fix '' option , but i 'm
i still have the problem that running all cmd/juju tests times out on my main box
if it were me and wanted to use multiple releases , i 'd have partitioned the drive with 3 primary
yep your ram is almost out ... .
also , these errors crop up in kern.log seemingly *only* when i 'm running a cron-based rsync backup from one
whats crackin ?
i 'll do that later .
alot of nasty things going on in 15.04 and 15.10
yeah
unmounting flushes changes to the disk and ensures no processes have open files on the disk
**poke a stick at it , `` command trackpad not found . ''
where did i say `` run it as root '' ?
have you updated to 89 ?
i 'm not interested in windows ; i 'm giving you info on how to tune linux power usage
just running debuild -uc -us -b should be more than enough to show the problem once you have fixed the
it works with images designed for both . the two methods ( cd vs hd ) are very different ,
no problem
well , think about it this way : we only support what we have tested , so unless you need
try asking in # ubuntu-gnome .
gah , the usual xdg crap .
deskop is up
or aptitude
that 's what i 'm thinking . and that thing could even be something in juju itself .
dholbach has been sponsoring but has been busy recently and not it is late here in europe .
you can poke the bot to your heart 's content by private messages
offloading uses prime , that didnt exist in the nvidia drivers back then
what do you think happened or is happening
it *seems* to be an interaction between dbus-daemon and networkmanager
what 's not ?
because 15.04 has n't been released ; )
normal
also , there 's a ap test now , testing a happy path ( setup , chanage it , disable
that is for what
see ubuntu core , snappy
why do you think that ?
just set header.flickable = null , or header.flickable = yourflickable to enable scrolling
i 'll do that
ok.. as i mentioned earlier we do this in silo 27 already , bumping unity8 to 8.11
is windows installed on efi on the ssd ?
plasma is still under development so if you 're on a production machine on the job etc i would wait
not actively looking , my plate is full ( unless priorities change and move me to a different plate )
ok
basename $ 0
just select another mirror ( i will not say that again ) , to finally get things done : )
oh nice !
sorry thats a type in the cli command it should be .17
thats nonsense .
the /sbin/dmraid-activate script relies on `` dmraid -i -si -ct < device > '' to get the device type ;
midonet-api
already , now restart ?
( we need two , and an explicit signoff from -core is always good )
what was the purpose of the + ?
i am losing weight
i 'll grep
although.. killing it with a some sort of errtryagain with decreasing number of retries , finally killing it ; with
just rechecked , definitely gone now
could be one of these 2 : sudo service ssh restart / systemctl restart sshd.service ( 15.04/systemd )
please elaborate ; your question or issue may not seem clear or detailed enough for people to help you .
oh it 's you
`` lsmod | grep 8812 ''
a ty polak ?
sgtm
ok ! anyway , uploading the gles now to the same silo
not really but i havent read the last review just the email
how did you install it ? by additional drivers ?
give me 2 seconds
never had the problem before with similar ones
okie dokie : )
then we can inform an interim decision about which of the two options to aim for .
doublecheck every single option , until you can disable those
should n't it be ctrl+l and not ctrl +l
that 's the plan . i 'm going to undo the fixes he made .
who maintains britney upstream these days ? i feel like little formatting improvements like that should probably just go to
that 's what people said about 64 ; - )
will dmesg | grep sound work ?
just to be sure , did you change anything in the synology settings regarding nfs ?
hrm , what do you usually do ?
it shows vga and lvds connected .
no
awesome !
are you on the system ?
are there instructions for live testing , or is it in your head ?
can you tell me which package to report the bug against ?
at the very least , we may need some more automated testing around this
`` denials '' ? write errors ?
if you want one then you would get a mirpointerbutton ( singular ) i guess
if it was mvo , i 'd expect he plans to do apt as well .
more seriously , it 's rather easy
meant to say :
we pay 3 million a year
sorry ... it was for ahemlockslie
do you have any idea where the grubx64.efi is coming from then ?
yes
you have to copy-and-paste stuff out of that json file
yes , i can do systemctl set-enviroment -- user env=value , which seems to work just as when i did
unless teward lied to me , it has : )
which one are you referring to ? something in the browser engine ?
i have the phoenix internal documentation on that tool .
( sorry , never saw that page )
damn that command is kind of good
is there a free vmware anymore ?
secondly , doing a dbus.conn.listunits ( ) only lists running/stopped/idle etc.. units , and does not help at all in
why to declare that yout are an indian
well , docker does them already
not at all ... it is a phone
where did you see that ?
still feels a little fragile , as it 's opt-out rather than opt-in , so default behaviour would be to
indeed , sorry again
hmm , ok . i have seen people in well written project not calling the public api twice in their
because grid unit is not really a physical unit
15.04
i already tried proxychains , they would n't work
the older ones have pretty good oss support , but not always
no , leave it to the side . why must it be centre ?
so the ppa would have built without cursor change support .

yes

if it were me in your shoes , i 'd start doing everything manually , from the terminal , step-by-step
weird ... it gets stuck to the selected.field indeed ...
yup , then 'git reset -- hard ubuntu-4.2.0-18.22 ; fakeroot debian/rules clean binary-generic '
gnome-system-tools is
why not partition your drive to a / and a /home partition , no backup required after that just install
yep , let 's skip
ah right , there 's space at the end ... no idea how that got there
tx , will have a look soon
ok , do you have pastebinit installed ?
i landed that one in both
please , keep it in the channel
well , i could break it and you could test it
who should handle the `` ubuntu online accounts '' review ?
i chose not to use the installed system as root . it mounts the installed system on /target .
i dont know about windowmaker . could be the issue that its the bottleneck , not because of ram usage
in fact , it 's something we can run from the tree at any time
wait until its fixed and dont use it until then .
not all environmental variables and paths are made available to cron . can you paste the script ?
i just told you
any idea why i 'm not seeing parole controls ? : p
let me check
my rule is `` touching perl ''
okay , now i 'm logged in . scopes are full-screen , but apps start in windows , and the
yes that is what i have been doing
yea , i had been working two weeks on a project . i had committed but had n't pushed :
i can upload for vivid too sure
it is n't though , it is already hidden in the system , it is n't installed so you ca
we dont support hacking .
so i am the admin of the ubuntu-clock-developers team , would i still get emails about mps , bug reports
uhh.. right . i am now beyond my understanding of the process : )
you know what i was working on in qtmir was actually just smoothness . if it goes well , that
why would you want that ?
do you want in ? no obligation
do you use uefi ?
ok , that xorg came from the older kernel :
am using an external wifi card even in the live ubuntu my internal wifi card is not being detectted
the important question therefore is , how many have you been charged for
you missed the -a
that might be the case . perhaps you can still use e.g . juju with the charms to deploy openstack
rename it to core-1505- or convergence-1505- and i 'll accept it to the sprint
we had a similar issue recently . ubuntu-ui-toolkit is ambitious , sometimes to the point of non-portable
ok , i 'll update the one in the ppa , since the package i pushed to the archive is
we said earlier kubuntu next , i saw that in webupd8
did you create your own branch ?
no , i 'm telling you i know those still fit on a cd and dsl is pretty small if
so the merges would n't merge correct things anymore
please run my command to make sure its at the latest state .
why is 23 still blocked ?
another todo item : support `` frameless '' window hint or something like it
great , thx
ie , have you already authenticated with the google ?
andyrock is on it
doesnt matter
how large is the drive and what type ?
greyback and tsdgeos decided not to branch off for vivid overlay and use trunk for the moment , then resolve
in this case , it seems to be embedded just to avoid an explicit field name reference
really , i answered your upgrade to 15.10 question .
is there anything in `` sysctl -a | grep -i tcp '' or `` dmesg | grep den '' that
again ... we do not know for sure that your rotuer will allow speeds higher than 5m .
sdk devs expect development to happen in staging
yes i am on laptop
good-oh
no it will not stop working
you may use a link
yw !
ack - so who ' got topic change access ?
3.19.0-25-generic
do n't engage
it 's my fault for referencing it , which is why i said it was off topic and apologized
it 's not going to happen anytime soon . i 'm not even sure if it boots anymore . weekend
exactly
but is is known to work weird hours
does grep 10.0.3.1 /etc/maas return anything ?
it is now .
without the quotes .
not in your paste , please post the full output .
i read online that that 's a file type for use with java , so maybe ask them .
did you recreate the initrd , or update it ?
if you 'd be so kind as to give me a ping on here when release is ready to go
unmount it from the filemanager , and type sudo gdisk /dev/sdd again
oh , let me forward it
so is there a purpose to deploy this charm in a local env ? may be to verify it starts
and fwiw my local.jenv has `` localhost:17070 '' in both state-servers and server-hostnames fields , which is n't resolved
it looks like if we just do n't add the current snat rule we are fine . currently we have
what kind of file ?
he 's in ... just not in this channel
at least in my impression the mx4 is better
thx
contentstore instantiates a hub object , and it looks like the hub install an event filter
also a oneplus one port , was n't there ? or is that not done yet ? thought i saw
did we still have anyone with access to the bot emails..
i remember looking at this issue when it happened way back in 1.21. that time it was caused by a
regarding silo 12 , the fix needs to have some kind of automation .
and just disable the cloud-init job
do you say upgrade to me ?
right that 's fine then i just noted it as a difference between the one on the phone and the
ok , do you have a scip.conf somewhere ?
i could kiss you right now , but you would n't appreciate that
tests/.venv/bin/pip -- version
then it will work
you can do that by editing the request
yes i did add it
nice , i have n't even heard of slimit
multiboot
that 's something seperate from juju but works with juju . it 's actually itself a charm
i just wanted to try the bleeding edge stuff , not do a reset to stable
if it 's possible then it 's still much more ewww than the former
i had installed ubuntu 15.04 but 32 bits , now it is 64 , because i 've seen the pc
you will have to one up them by getting moonstone in missouri
ping
indeed , i really like that
urgh , this needs more fixing . the .desktop files are now localized -- _except_ for the quicklist entries .
or any number of computers , for that matter .
lucky_22 'pip install configparser '
cloud-init needs the maas server that it was instaled with to be present at each boot .
ah i thought there were more
then there would be just one download for linux
in what way ?
and it installed you lightdm with unity deps ?
`` dpkg -i ''
try 'ctrl-insert ' to copy then , and 'shift-insert ' to paste .
it appears that after letting it discharge a little bit , it 's heading back toward 100 % like normal
i vaguely remember ubuntu_menuproxy not being set anymore , any recollection of that ?
/j # channel
no need for a new bug - it 's just a more serious manifestation of the existing bug about that
go go go !
2 gib for both public and private
if it was up to me , i 'd definitely not make it the default on anything
oh well , downgrades dont work on ubuntu
right , when it hangs i never gets and never gets to the dm
sure ? i 'm on 127 now
good luck , i 'm off to bed , hopefully everything goes great : )
ok
made a symlink for images so it points to a folder in /home/
devs will wake up at other times for sure
i want silo 3
all ( local and live ) tests except 5 in multi_test pass
because it sets up that low level trace call this way
google for the flag to remove that , i forget how offhand
if it is landing through a silo then yes it would need signing off . but i guess it would
no problem ...
which specific package ?
also in order to get more eyes on the problem , it would probably be best to send an email
does that mean there is a chance that the lo fix could land too ?
why drop burg ? i liked the graphic interface : ( lol
i was expecting it to hit the debug on l56 but i do n't see that in my console :
pipe it to text file : dpkg -l > myfiles.txt
which library renaming are you referring to ?
i mean , from the reviews i 've seen , it looks visually very nice .
what about usb ?
yes it works everywhere
not to know is not a sin , all were new at one time .
yw
not true : p
no weather its a team name or indiv it should be the same
maybe fix broken packages from grub recoverymode can also help you
oh that sucks
that is going to be a very slow experience with that graphics card and that amount of ram on a
disable it after install ?
can you phrase that so it sounds like an ubuntu support question ?
i upgraded to 14.04 from 12 and had an icon to switch keyboards based on language .
so , basically , i 'm trying to make sure that deactivating and reactivating a package does everything it should
try sudo ubuntu-emulator create myinstance
you can disable it , since the first release .
i only have a bar on the top
reviewed
it sounds like that 's what the hook is doing ( i.e . something completely external to the .deb build
that 's what i said
it 'll parse however juju handle config-get without config , which should just be { }
keep in mind that ie has some heavy security flaws , i would not reccomend daily use..
unfortunately it seems that patch will need some more work , in was working on parsing the file now ,
likely same problem
now show us `` pastebinit < ( tail /var/log/kern.log ) ''
emacs screen redraw is unbearably slow , multi-threaded compile jobs lock up my system when they did n't do that
so for my own snap the only thing to do is use hw-assign , right ?
ugly configurator ? oh no ... never !
this is what is on my system :
tsdgeos said it 's unstable
should be fine . the ubuntu boxes i 've moved to sysd went without trouble .
oh ! ! so cool ! !
do you think converting them to jpeg would be better ?
i 'm looking for that email thread to forward to you
ah , it 's already been done .
well windows is n't linux , so the fact that it works there only serves to show that the microphone
yes
yeah thats true but i just thought perhapse you guys have a solution to my problem . yesterday everything was
sure , we seem to be doing better than most parts of the world accoding to the official news ,
if the programs are called programold- then use pkill ^programold- to kill them all
because it 's structured to implement v1 and v2 separately . adding v3 under that structure is a very large
255.255.255.255 = 1111111111111111111111111111 or 32 ones = /32
no , no 5.12 packaging
what are you trying to achieve then ?
why are you adding ?
you can do something else for me too
can you actually reconfigure silo 12 for us please , i added qtmir-gles
it 's a lenovo g500 with intel i3 cpu , and 8g ram and 1tb hdd ... pretty plain jane
so , on my system , that would make the logrotate scripts for samba and rsyslog buggy . and probably
the only upgrade you *could* do is to 14.04 .
i head out for dinner now , but happy to do that
yes , that is currently what i am doing . i am using a docker , inside it , i
mmm
actually , i 've tried and had nothing but hell putting ubuntu on it
`` make doc '' on the project works fine . /me asks alex
yep . ah ssd , which model ?
can you do sudo grep `` oops id '' /var/log/upstart/whoopsie.log and add that to the report
it *is* in the usage line . did you try running it ?
cool : ) tell me when you have the data bits in place , i 'll adapt the template to
i stand by my advice
holy ...
one more thing you should add to your consideration - > if you go with php 7.0.n where n is
i 've given you the fix . your choice .
so wondering if you are seeing the same thing
why you talk about backup `` android '' ? it is to backup your whole flash .
you already installed and still have the windows partition ?
i meant what are you doing to encounter this error
yeah , most people just run ap tests on real iron or the emulator ; the setup script was quite
if you boot and get a blank screen you can always try passing nomodeset as a kernel option
no , but there installer is ok
advise when you are at terminal in the liveusb .
it looks like confinement gets in your way here ...
sudo lshw -c network
and whats the complete output before and after ?
how is it not that simple . you said everything at work was configured with ubuntu , so just continue
yeah , it does . we 'll keep an eye on it at our end also : - )
did i mention cuda ? no , but he needs the nvidia driver working in order for the cuda to
i touched /data/.factory_wipe and rebooted hoping it will do something , but it did n't .
fix pushed
what is missing in apps 15.08.1 , are they ready for tests ?
yes , at some times 15.04 issue get fixxed here
/dev is quite empty
dont see why you cant open it
make a new repo ?
my bad i have n't noticed this comment was about the shortlist
maybe notice it in some blueprint ( s )
what am i missing ?
it will peg the cpu to 100 %
computrace makes uses of the smm procesoor
ok - try and bear in mind that we 're doing beta this week and not only am i worrying
probably no hardware acceleration though
like what ?
; )
`` /join # ubuntu-cz ''
if you bother about performance on a slow and /or older system try lubuntu
you 've been in here like a year and still you 're timewasting ? grow up please
but of course if a downstream needs rebuilding ...
well , i 've tried that ... .
on it in a minute !
and even if you cant boot after install , there 's always recoverymode failsafex
i really like saying the bug is not in juju
i have high hopes that one day we will have a simple provisioner that is no more or less than

goodness knows , just download the amd64 and i386 logs and run batchpatch on them
i know lol

that sounds reasonable . though could get unwieldy
dimitern : the strongest argument for not promising it is that if we do n't do it we can always
standards-version is now 3.9.6
not in .jenv i just bootstrapped again and dumped out the attrs - only access-key and secret-key are set ,
be sure to search for a bug report , and file one if it is n't reported
because robru requested that he does n't any longer use the spreadsheet for it
i`m not gon na get into why that`s not the case..
enable full smart monitoring and alerting , and act on it
after having done 'pip install -- upgrade nikola ' what does it report now for the version on the same
true , but docker keeps the base system clean . having many extra libs on your base install is unnecessary
i meant `` his environment '' as in the phone , not *his* phone .
are you still looking at that testfix ?
do n't use it
runs on each master state server ( like cleaner , resumer )
or if we have a link that does n't work
for ubucon , that 's what i 'm putting together now
if you are not using launchpad , when you update the template you should use msgmerge to manually do this
pstolowski , it 's buggy
btw unsure if you saw my ping on monday ( or i did n't see you reply ) , did

and that
anyway in the former you are actually running the script directly but the latter is running it via ( upstart
it seems to be persistent
yes , ubunu+whatsapp

this channel is for ubuntu support , other distros go in their various channels

even one that used phonon experimental ?
xterm worked after chmod 666 /dev/ptmx

i do think a revert at this point to unblock is sensible - if you need help testing before landing
off for the night ?
which is why i asked , is kwin-hwcomposer being used anywhere
it 's the ubuntu 15.04 desktop arm64 image written to usb disk . i 've done this about 20 times

try grub rescue again if you want and type ls ( hd0 , msdos2 ) / and see if it
no , we only respond to actual words , not sms speach
yeah i will get the help of zsombor to approve and merge the mp tomorrow morning as well
i 'm pretty sure wallworld and dimitern also have the root credentials , but they may not realize it .
by release it 'll be near the 1.9.x branch , with 1.10.x as an after-release update
i also suggest the # ubuntu channel in your native language
i can do that , what next ?
so , if you 're keen to dive into the perl , be my guest , it should be trivial
yep , the rest of debian/copyright appears valid
then sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
where does tarmac run ?
for example , i requested sponsorship of fossetcon
the installations should be identical , but as it seems on the core i5 `` libmirplatform5driver.so '' is loaded versus

it 's my canonical account
they communicate over dbus
that time , yes . but the other time , no
.2 version of what ? explain yourself
4 gigs will be plenty . back to spinning my wheels .
kde-workspace is now fixed
yes .
which is more or less what we did when ubuntu participated in alphas , but then we stopped . :
the login has a gear drop down
you heard right
negative . my monitor is set as primary ( it also has my tool bar and desktop icons , so
asound is usefl for simple testing
i 've been battling with it , but think i figured it out !
what are you talking about ? do you mind share with us ?
a partner for shouting matches . usually you throw four-letter words at it and it replies with page-long error messages
for full runs i often start it and walk away so do n't really notice core usage
if you can , simply do .
you can always switch back ... .
oh sorry i misread the partition
we are going to need that to be able to install snappy on a machine , right ?
started it now
live usb stick works , but it 's not straightfoward to know if you start in uefi mode or not
gpt stores a copy of the partition table at the end of the drive , so just doing a dd
chill out
ah , i thought he meant non-ubuntu-flavors as well
great question , let me spin up a do environment and inspect
yeah
especially with the barrier to verified being somewhat lower than it was for approved

my connection is good . but now , it 's low .
did you try booting a previous kernel yet ?
mirv , i just replayed the build job 's merge queue and the only thing that 's not the same
its just that you dont use the `` root rights '' for running the browser or irc or ... ..
i dont understand
i will subscribe tim and ask for him to give an opion
that means i 'll be disconnected from the current network , yeah ?
i know . but if i try to bind these disk onto the ramblocks ?
hoping still we might have the gallery fix today , it 's partially working but a copule of usecases that

you should have gotten an invite from cproffit
i have access to /var/www/html but no permission to upload files into it
as in `` sudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop ''
is this machine some kind of vmware esxi host or similar ?
hightlight with mouse , move to terminal , middle-click
you can only erase one partition and then put the free space into the other partitions .
you exec.command ( `` snappy '' , `` login '' ) ?

i am trying to ignore but ci will remain red until it is fixed . anything i can do ?
not too shabby . furious bug fixing before demo time at the sprint : )
pick on him in another channel then
i have a black screen , when clicking on the first level
so the window should show /dev/sda and /dev/sdb yes ?
wich version are you on ?
so it 's not the de then . test a different browser ; chrome or chromium
that 's fine
the error does not ring a bell : /
ok , that looks right
and afterwards i did reboot
will any of those command rune my disk ?
at least back on 14.04 ( which is what i 've been sticking with for installs at work ) it
what you should do , is every time someone uses a nick change to show their status , pipe an

naturally , you 'd have to tell me how to do that : (
dc and marvel are comics too : p
would you recommend i do that when i have ubuntu-base installed and , as of now , everything seems fine
i can do that , will take a bit of time since even generating the source package takes a while
so then you should be good . you can make sure there 's an application-legacy job by doing initctl list
or well ... the only way to repro
for the first step , reboot your modem / router
very nice !
i will check to see if it was the www-data group i added . turned off the vm . if
uhm , that seems like a hack ( and one for 12.10 ) . i tried using `` apt-cache --
no problems : )
gccgo-go [ powerpc ] drop this , not necessary anymore
you installed and ...
scp -rp < file > < username > @ < ip address or hostname > : /home/name
still does not work . i am going to try without the silo to see if its a regression
yeah , so dumb
did you follow up the .precommit thing ?
systemd-bootchart does have that option , you might need some quoting , i. e. init= '' ... -i ... ''
np
well , i guess you can either looking on launchpad or install ubuntu to look at it : p
go well
works perfectly on windows though : (
anyway , on my local adt , it 's clearly the sed setting upstart by default which causes this issue
random orange-ness on apps15.08 or ci would be a possiblity

laney , can you retry the desktop-next image build ? updated livecd-rootfs is in wily
the failure-rate due to the qml-cache bug is ... about 20 %
it 's not that . i have to re-auth and it wants a new password
right , proposed-migration just needs a wily image
it does n't affect anything else , it 's effectively just early warning for the charm that soon it wo
no .
sounds fair to me
we all here to learn mate
go to www.xshellz.com make a shell , then use tor with ssh to connect there and use irssi
so , it 's possible that from our side the core problem is that mako is broken , and not

hi , how are things ? are you still the one to talk to about unity-control-center ?
at least that 's how we intended it in the spec , hope that the gui reflects that : -
sure with unlimited money and manpower
and there is also # ubuntu-server : - )
my hope is that this 2nd toolchain would be the same as the 1st ... with some extra build options
do you have ondemand cpu able ?
i created a contact called `` orange ''
if you want/can update every 6 months then n14.10 is ok , but for beginners better go lts
did you autoindent or something ? i wonder if the indent style was inconsistent before or your editor messed it
iirc if you file a bug against ubiquity it will upload the install logs which might help
that fits you so well

done
was this for 1.24.1 or 1.24.0 ?

i can certainly see that particular item may be frustrting ; i 'm also aware that other individuals involved have
line 2 states that you have gpu built into your cpu , and no other gpu .
does it matter that that is a windows share tutorial
note that i do n't want the orientation of the apps ( that is influenced by the orientation lock )
you were just given them : )
the problem is that with the current way how ci train does m & c after robert 's changes it
it 's part of openssh

was that a minimal install ?

yeap firing it up one second
which version of xubuntu are you on ?
so your jack detection is not reliable , and therefore the original patch makes sense to keep for you as
inet addr : 192.168.1.100 ? is that it ?
ok. also , i have the issue now that youtube videos ( or any other web players ) will not

yeah i just need it to cook the gpu , i 'm not much of a gamer
nice ! i 've not heard of those , but i loved baldurs gate haha
abhinavm : maybe xubuntu ?
cool , i saw something squeezebox related the other day and thought of you with it .
new friends ? : p
its a dual boot system
/ is rw after popey command . remount without issues .
that 's my issue ... nikesh just chimed in and wanted to talk about it too
is lcy01.rs a typo , or deliberately disabled ?
ok , so it sounds it 's good to go then ?
you ca n't get flash player10
let me know when it 's ready and i 'll create the silo
yes
what about if you just say telnet google.com 80 over your ipv6 address ,
i should sue
how does your fstab look now ?
well if the design has changed , i have n't been kept up to date with it
and language
looks very cool , do you know if it can take over a django cms db ?
i didnt say that , thats your choice wich version you wan na be using
yes , does nothing

just to avoid your pain in filed bugs .
sudo apt-get install nvidia-340 | pastebinit ?
i had a chat with some of the guys in the office , and they came up with a better
but , honestly , it 's also annoyingly tricky to do usefully for any stateful workload
you are filtering trunk bugs
doing sfo - > ams - lys ( and then train to annecy )
an unsatisfiable depends wo n't prevent the build from completing , but you might end up with a .deb you
no doubt but no need
there is an `` echo '' option in mumble
there we go , ditched xchat

things like file permissions are an operating system issue ... just as much ( or even more so ) than
sudo add-apt-repository -r ppa : iaz/battery-status
you would think that page would be under techbase
it didnt work , sorry
ugh 16 % and i ca n't change rendering settings : (
nope .
qapt verified working
that will not magically fix the script .
hey what 's with you being disgusted all the time ? : d always looks like a ragequit xd
yup , busy looking at jq to see if that can help
then you then the prime package
no problem at all
for the signature , does it have to be an actual signature , or can it just be a printed
well , there 's no versioning but the stuff from the git branch . trying to clean it up and

ok
not the standard ubuntu . you could try lubuntu , xubuntu or ubuntu mate .
cool , can you review my small reviews i have waiting for manpower ?
looks perfect , upload away .
feel free to not update the next chair ; - )
yes i am worried about that - apparently disabling recommends install is something that alot of cloud operations like todo
i have no access to a debian machine right now , maybe someone else can walk you through .
when using the keypad it has no formatting and after i press set it seems to correctly add the country
we are not obliged to reply to everyone ... you should try being a bit more patient
no worries : - )
do you think restricted drivers may help with that in consideration ?
ppa works fine afaik , i was working on moving to new touch events but it can wait
ok , i 'm looking into that
agreed , but i was thinking shorter term
please do n't use underscores in package names
should i write that commandline
make sure you merge my branch first too , so everything is more up to date
well , first step download and check the hash on a 14.04.1 64-bit iso
is this your home desktop ?
i 'm going to push my `` alternate '' duc branch , the one fixing the deployments issues , to

it is baldur 's gate , running under gemrb usinf sdl2

i cant find the iso download ?
the plot goes more obscure , but i see weird things on cloud-worker-10 : kern.log is full of lines like
unity8.log has
but sometimes 3,5mm jack headphones have a ripple pickup
the missing prepare for end user is definitely oem
ok install that mate
no errors . should i try booting to the hdd now ?
hate to break it to you but we all got old . : )
where do you get that error ?
unless the makefile has overrides to make that possible , or you only call the install libs target , you

note that as far as the unblock request goes , testing has 0.33 only ; i figure you want 0.36
thx : )

even if x did fail to start due to something like that , you should still be able to boot
no
less risky not to
did you ever boot successfully from that usb thumb ?

i didn ' t have hardware acc on 14.04 so i installed 14.10 and evrything works smoothly
no mbr magic ?
you have been asking this from this morning
otherwise , you 're passing the result of lxc.attach_run_command ( command ) to attach_wait ( ) : )
last time i reflashed i picked poorly
fsck puts lost files in that location .
does this problem happen when using that kernel ?
if the driver was installed via ubuntu 's repositories , that would 've been done automatically
you can feel good now that i 'm finally able to look at those mps ; - )
can i patch it somehow for the demo ?
/join # ubuntu-it
great ... all this information is very helpful to us in narrowing down the precise scenario
great
ah , i 'll try u-d-f from vivid then ?
can we detect those never-passed ones , and not show them on pending-sru as regressions ?
you wo n't believe : it has started saving display settings between sessions !
can you please mark them as rejected in bugzilla then ?
'a pty is created by a process through posix_openpt ( ) '
i try to make it better one piece at a time but there 's a long way to go
it is good now , still needs people to review and approve
then there is a package overlap . i suggest you report a bug
yes
of the sent message ?
ask in # ubuntu-server
forgot the `` / '' ?
i meant as a desktop : p
it 's nothing to do with us and offtopic here . good luck , but stop asking here .
if you mean those in .deb packages , no idea . if you mean on developer.ubuntu.com , mhall119 created the
there is n't one anymore , /etc/x11/
retry
yeah , nothing i can really do here , so when you get the issue and you are stuck ,
ok , must be misremembering something
in which way would you like me to check ? i can do fsck or a smart test if you
nope
grub is a key area for lots of things so it has uses you will need .

are you able to reproduce this igb bug ?
sorry , i dont know how to determine that , perhaps from syslog
'fraid so
i will try and keep you updated
hmm , works with 2.44.x , but not with git master ( 2.45.1+ )
lets dig into why that is
problem is , if you have apps that are not on the dvd , you will miss parts
you wo n't be able to port to iphone .
trailing ?
could n't find what ?
also may simply not exist
yes . we should just gate on the mp , and if they are green , they must be green
i 'd probably do a tiny bit of research on chipset and such to make sure whatever you get is
sure , i would rather like to have it local , though . we can discuss a little later ,
the ap tests have few problems : ) one of them is that they do not start ... they simple

if you download their online installer are you able to get it to work
want me to re-add it on line 62 ?
i ca n't guarantee you this but i would try to boot again from usb and install boot-repair
how ?
so ... if i decided to use juno and ubuntu finishes the juno support , maybe with the next ubuntu
i forwarded the session mail to users
( heya ! ) well the time zone is set to the right one if that 's what you mean
oh , i see , stabilizing vivid to branch again , kind of
we 'd need the gcc fixes branch landed soon - what 's the state of silo 18 ?
i mean a service 's space requirements indirectly should keep its subnets in state
upstream ?
great minds !
yeah
ask your question
thats what i see if utorch is open , yes .
yes it is
settle down there , google fiber
is tty7 also blank ?
awilkins was obviously misreading the prompt because his is different to yours
yeah i remembered from the first time , but was curious that way around .
ok , well just try and filter your frustrations from reaching your typing fingers : )
but most of my testing has been limited to just bootstrapping
seems the time is meant to be after the lease was claimed
for amd64 , not i386
my interface file looks ok . i will post it for you to read
ok , removing and adding the new one
yes it is
lets hope they dont touch uefi stuff
i like the gnome shell , i always have a cairo-dock and use an app called synapse to pull up

`` you can switch to read-write mode , although this disables ubuntu system upgrades ''
the signal -usr1 is what i 'd already spoken of ; )
is the relation-set to a unique value ?
i do n't think that 's the case at all , is it ?
and is that the same behavior as before ?
i would be happy to handle landing if you refresh my memory on what to do
can you help me ?
nothing was selected . : d
will downgrade to confirm , but i pretty certain its gtk ; )
you are on ota4/vivid ?
los amigos on state at 12:30
type ls -l sam
do you have that problem ?
so i still say it ca n't fail
well , all of them
for multiple lines , paste.ubuntu.com
gateway
no , i am just trying to be helpful , you dont .
if you create a `` revision '' file and increase the revision number in it each time , it may
the owner for symlinks is irrelevant .
what 's it say when you do that ?
the flash slaes are announced ~1 day ahead on the @ bqreaders and ubuntu twitter accounts
go to terminal
sambafiles
maybe fceux ( nes ) or kega fusion ( sega master system and genesis ) would work ... i ran
from 14.10 ?
that 's strange .
no ned to stop on my account : )
+1
you have the same bug ?
so you can go to that directory in terminal ? without sudo ?
yeah , it 's just a warning - it 's expected and ok
but yeah that 's a good question re feature freeze . i imagine an exception would be allowed for that
nice ... even if the service exists on a container already ?
ah , via jenkins ? ok , i did n't try that : )
which is correct , yes .
staging deploy update : we still need an external intervention to do it , to upload the project tarball to
yes i understand that in your situation , that 's a wise move
12.10 , 13.04,13.10 are not supported anyway . what about 14.04 ?
i just followed up again
i never talked about a `` phone '' i always talk about an handheld pc or pda
yes , just use it for daily tasks
after a backup maybe
ok , the answer is yes : ) that 's the only way to go with dputs
switching to tty1 is good too . maybe look in ~/.xsession-errors for the broken user
this is my only pc right now , lol
so we have to ensure the format is correct
consider installing windows in a vm if you can , or get a copy of the hiren boot cd .
you 're understanding it wrong , really .
do you use that same password for any other website or service ?
if you put it on the desktop it behaves same as in systray , so it activates messanger or when
i suggest using luks or gpg instead
might be an idea for you to read the channel rules . no swearing including acroyms is not allowed here
yes
add sudo before do , do sudo mount
i 'm not familiar with pantheon .
seahorse also behaves the same for the 2k keys
which gpu is causing the multi-monitor issues ?
i 'll do it in less of a hurry as i update packages ...
the only thing i did was systemctl status .
let me know how that works
i 'm quite sure qstandardpaths wraps that as well , but let me try
trying now
does it mean we dont have any avl tool..
ok , i understand now why it works , and why i do n't need vsftp or proftp
there are 39 users listed in that channel . i 'd advise asking you question and then having patience ...
and you push that to the feature branch directly ?
right . it works now .
does your switch support gbe too ?
it all makes sense now : )
define `` does n't appear to work '' ?
the reason i switched my shop comp to lubuntu is cuz it only has 512 ram
what ?
to do what ?
np .
the easiest way to do that is to upgrade to vivid .
yes
no ribbon effect , you mean
also , check the device is found in `` /var/log/kern.log '' when the dock connects
check your system bios for usb legacy support options . likely they are conflicting
ok , for the moment i can ignore the ui constraint , either wrap it in qt or some html5
he is at the bottom in the pics
ok , what 's the output of the git clone command ?
and then reverses that too
version is `` ubuntu 14.04.2 lts ''
so , i 'd have a 33 % chance of needing to kill if there was regret . : p
yep
can you give me any link to tutorial or explain me how to do that ?
but since we have separate files for each , i see it that we have 3 tamplates : front ,
ok i see
like , what consumes them , whether the consumer needs to be adjusted , and how that relates to the
enable the trusty-update repo , update your sources and try to update again .
the same as it works now
no these are local ap failures..which complain that `` testclock '' has no attribute 'main_view '
we already do support providers without storage . those changes landed like 9 months ago
`` installation finished . no error reported . ''
libc and the qt libs would be nice , though
also hwinfo -gfxcard or lspci -k
i was doing dynamic_cast < scopes* > ( m_scope- > parent ( ) ) ; inside the previewmodel
i 'll start claiming the tasks now .
please ask in the inkscape comunity if there is an alternative
we have plenty of build resources at the moment . if it actually works then it 's fine .
yes
i suppose the goal was to get away from having two dns servers
: d
good thing software is patient
all ubuntu versions from topic
that 's pleasantly progressive of it
however you should use the server installation images/isos instead of the desktop ones
with ubuntu permissions , the main reason i want encryption is because i 'm installing on an ssd , and
you 'll have to do that yourself
and i have an archive of gtk+ apps i use for work
are you trying to get your bios to boot an iso ?
why not ?
is your local network connected to internet also ?
see ^
so we do n't set depwaits more than one level down
i get the same thing with the full path
i guess the issue is that it is in /writable/cache/system/etc/systemd/system at all ...
contacts , calendar , same thing ; - )
but only that silo , not taking the others for now
your diggint to deep mate , you browsing on 12.04 now
let me try something first ...
well that 's your opinion : )
which , is cool.. and , im certainly glad you are here , and enjoying it . but , im
rebuild-request ignore default-arches , and does exactly what you asked it to do .
this way `` started '' will only be emitted , when the thing exits .
the thing is that there is n't really a reason to specify _every_ mount point unless you have a special
i 'll try to push it for monday , it 's a small update
that will test the new functionality , i ran the entire plan . so that is up to you
it works fine on windows , though
i lied , they 're there .
first of all , is the usb device identified ? can you describe more in detail what `` i ca
i agree on both counts
so.. is it right that i could lose the possibility to get update if i remount the system rw ?
i found a net install iso ubuntu distro . ( in ubuntu official site ) . size is 33 mo
both failed again : /
well , two ideas
oh , nice
faster than one individual disk
yeah , other were happy , not i ! : )
reviewed ... would you like me to top-approve as well ?
nothing matches that .
what wifi card do you have
windows works on ide mode , but then i had troubles getting ubuntu live cd booted
~/.kde/share/config/plasma-desktop-appletsrc
yes , but after all you can mount it in the server box and then make it available to the
will that automatically adjust the other sizes ?
sad ...
both is n't a great idea , cause there is a performance it for `` encrypted home '' , and
could this check be done *before* the silo can even be marked ready for qa ?
hey as well : - )
it worked it was just being very slow
i said i was on it
did you change anything network related lately ?
yes exactly
although some of them are just because excuses was last updated 30 mins ago , some are older than that
well , systemd is in main so as far as your are concerned you can add that recommends and be
sure , one moment
if i have a chance i 'd love to help out . let 's see how time allows me too..
i have an avermedia tv stick which is supported on linux , but the signal quality is awful . i
yup , ill test that , but i cant do it here , got to go
i 'm nagging alex-abreu : )
type sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
i shuld mention its wily
maybe there are acpi issues , check syslog or dmesg warnings in your logs
what is `` ubuntu config '' ?
ah , ok , nevermind .
no it does n't , but it 's a damn good place to start ! ; ) -
`` it '' ?
i remember on my laptop it took me some time to get those tricky settings down . but i assure
get everyone to one conf
it 's complaining about a missing dep : python-keystoneclient , do you remember why it was removed ?
do you know much about tox ?
righ
i even had a guy on wily with usb booting never able to f6 nomodeset , trusty= no issues
to invert that selection , and print out all of the fields except 1 and 6 , put -- complement
but it makes development faster as you can just assemble/run
why are you mentioning wine then
yes
openvpn , interesting..
for your case , can you patch the pythonpath ?
i can reproduce it 100 % of the time , when running the full test suite
fyi , i looked at your first patch yesterday and i thought it looked good . i did n't do
that is why ftp is a bad thing , for example . but still a lot of users use that
i 'd be curious to see documentation about release cadence and so forth then .
this fix restricts the cases affected by my previous patch , so testing that the unit tests run should be
i have two 2 terabytes drives , one is a backup the other is a backup of it .
i am better off waiting a couple of months ?
do the files have +x on them ?
it 's the same
on that use `` gparted '' to sort the partitions
hmm , maybe 'which ' did n't find the path to the executable
not like ping is crucial to the function of your ipv4 network
no normal
instead of preallocating it all
could you pastebin the output of 'sudo parted /dev/sdc ' ?
sudo apt-get install firmware-iwlwifi
maybe the installer has an uninstall option ?
now ... anything that can see an operation can do wtf it likes to state
how can i get that info ?
some binaries indeed have an epoch ( that was what the whole bug was about )
hm , what does systemctl status give you ? if it stops or dies it should be visible there
being able to look up documentation oneself is a useful skill imho : )
i dont think we have any way to test audio on non armhf ( the x86 emulator doesnt provide any
i ca n't because it 's a remote ovh system
that 's good i guess : )
nano
i 'm assuming for this you actually want the amd64 version ?
ok , so the installer starts , do you use the `` try ubuntu '' method of starting it ?
not when using mesa driver , cant get the driver from ubuntu repo to work
i had it this way ubuntu 14.04
you have to paste the output on paste.ubuntu.com
which i7 do you have ?
try sudo apt-get install -- reinstall linux-generic
yep
then use central auth such as ldap
you can try whether that makes your desktop start again
eh , is this more education related stuff where the lecturer enforces running old oss ?
you can select the same button again
bug 1418460
not just cereals you kill , is it ? : )
for edgedragarea parameters
pretty sure this can be fixed by emitting a changed signal in the right place
egl clients work but do not render.. you can try eglplasma and hit 'q'.. it 'll quit fine .
this one is better . should i delete unity somehow ?
why are you polluting a lovely lts distro with utopic packages ? : p
why did you tweak ?
can you decribe what `` a disk that was owned by root previously '' means to you ?
not one bound to that , mind
still seems like there 's latency issues on vivid in general
time to get drastic . under normal circumstances you should n't do this : force dpkg to do all it
i ca n't find much about reseting the battery without that lenovo tool
: how can i disable default dock in left
nice , i 'm looking at it .
does that make it clear to you ?
do n't you mean bitcoin ?
maybe the app needs an intro think like podbird has ?
you are not using ubuntu as k in the os 's channel .
ack . i have n't produced a pr against your pr yet . been blocked on other things . :
how many tries ? its rare making this hard to debug and fix : /
huh . that 's fishy . we had a delta , so the sync would have been forced , but

good thing is you can have both 32 bit and 64 bit programs running in your ubuntu . - its
i hope launchpad will complain : )
yw
just switch to `` highcontrast '' in xenial and you will see the issue . so the indicator sends ``
have you ever seen this or can you suggest someone who can help him find a resolution ?
though you could just remove golang-go.tools and golang-golang-x-tools
what was in the queue was ubuntu-core-config ( accepted now ) , and ubuntu-snappy .
yeah , of course ... but you can get where it happens
well , that costs yoiu performance
its logged on the website
trolling ! : )
can you pastebin the output of `` vgdisplay '' please
ah ok , so the uncharge/recharge should fix that ?
this is my windows machine . i just put a small hd in the machine and installed ubuntu so i
or you could install lubuntu , and just use puppy from a usb . ( that is one cool feature
suggestion - put it back to port 22
do you have anything in the pipe for the -rc8 rebase ? i thought i 'd get that uploaded to
held the power button down until it shut off
should i update the mp or file a new one ?
oh , so if only 'en ' is installed , then 'en_us ' should still work even if it does
yeah , i suppose . i 'm looking at the upstart script first ho
reformat with gparted ?
first of all , a question : the install api requires the package name as specified in the rfc ,
sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get upgrade copy and paste to fpaste.org
well , it 's my fault as i accidentally built it and we tried to recover by bincopying to a
ok , rm the logs from /mnt/var if they are n't important
i 'm getting the squid 'access denied page '
thats the version thats in the distutils metadata for apturl i would say
ok what is not working then ?
no , how to do it
i guess that should be changed to wily
yup
yeah , the prblem is not all keep their pages on the loco portal active
: )
well , i was just wondering if you plan actual isos/imgs
ok
err , for args , yeah .
no sign of error or if it was already found
and no app running apart from emacs
i tried sud apt-get install mumble . i even did sudo apt-get update and then did it again . it
it can do most of the things already
i play life now : p
so the signature the apiserver expects from facade methods is listed on rpc.conn.serve ( ) 's doc comment
it may have been the case that the device was so messed up a complete flash was the only option
that option exists since3 2013
are you using unity ?
ok
others are not responding
that was silly
it looks like you 're using some random 3rd party binary that you did n't get from a package manager
please elaborate ; your question or issue may not seem clear or detailed enough for people to help you .
it works , but as i thought ( i forced the install to override the bluez5 to see if it
i 'm thinking making a sole app might be a bad idea since the clock app has it
afaik the full lubuntu 14.04 iso is still < 1gb
but this is on a running system ?
innodb : error : space header page consists of zero bytes in data file ./ibdata1
yea
true .
i bet people did .
i thought it would be noticed
encrypted ubuntu ?
cool , just saw the comment
in the next days would be enough ; i started the ffe , and we have some other thigns to
i was initially hoping you could just make minor changes to whatever ubuntu process was in use .
i 'm not particularly clear on the difference myself , *however*
you can stage in next-staging , they just have to go into a different ppa
minimec the problem still persists ... i did it in the order kadiro told
we have an empty fallback so it 's just a warning ; if we did n't have the fallback ,
is n't it better to download the latest drivers from nvidia and install them manually or ?
here 's my setup
yes
right
full error output
^
what do you think that actually means ?
you can open and read your files ?
next question . i tried to setup a static ip via snappy config ubuntu-core , and was successful . however
that would be helpful
ty ! fyi , it 's a blocker ( as indicated by the blocker tag )
i do n't think so .
how is asking what phones were released by meizu and bq which will have ubuntu , not appropriate here in
/etc/init.d/bluetooth
but i do n't think the nearby scope was touch so might be something your end
more security
i am not going to mark them until tomorrow when others have had the oppotunity to test .
added it to the sprint blueprint
is this wordpress ?
dunno ... i am for settings still , but just because of that autopilot problem and the uitk/upstart issue
fandiddlytastic
kde-config-fcitx is made by fcitx upstream ,
nothing comes up , it just returns a prompt
ah , i ca n't get past the login screen
i do n't recall doing that
yeah , the qtubuntu landing from yesterday dropped it ...
any way to check ?
re : the import . thing , i like that when what you 're trying to accomplish is supposed to
wtf i am not harassing
if you are dual-booting your laptop into linux the tools can be readily installed there
ideally , it would be a bit of meta-data that one can harvest easily
let me add this to the backlog
need libmessagingmenu-dev
you and your one letter changes ...
because that lateset log is 'older ' than the previous
sure , will have a look shortly
but its not 100 % great because of misisng dynamic binding of functions ( we talked about this some days
thnx for being my ocr on this ; )
if you email me i can put you in contact
yuk , there are tools to check the hard drive and file system .
i do n't have that ppa
ok , try to press esc when the pc boots , you might get a boot options menu , select
yes i know i always used usb-creator from the iso
correct
does pulseaudio work ?
that looks bad . have you tried booting with an older kernel version from the advanced menu ?
makes sense
that 's for the one which has ? ? then make_protobuf_object < mir : : protobuf : : wire :
^ you might look at some of those , doing renames
the installed stuff we put on their images
do you have trello access ?
i am looking forward to new version of ubuntu ( official website still keep saying to use ubuntu 14 which
yes i do . and i have already set the symbolic links
at least now you know where the error was - if it happens again , please call
fair enough , let me try it
i would need a ppa to go higher
right
are you trying to dual boot ?
bug 1471903 has some more details
yeah , probably , those are different components
ok , done
im on the same version , go to applications , then universal access , then onboard
there are 2 -- factory-reset perform a destructive factory reset and reboot .
14.04 also has new point releases , 14.10 iso is what it was at release time , so no new
should i change ?
you ca n't turn off efi . computers only have one firmware . on modern ones , it 's efi
how do i modify that
if there was no chance for warm reset ( each time the system was really unresponsible , means no more
the other ones are different channels
likely sameish for most
this is ubuntu ?
sudo apt install nvidia-340
a server thing .. had to connect to the server that # irssi lives on ? type ' /j #
first thing i do on servers is enable grub for 10 seconds on boot
do you have encryptfs running on your /home partition ?
yea you 're right , 90 % of the time those nickserv mistypes are though . i just did n't
yeah that would do it
openvpn isnt ... people using arale will have to flash from a pc after installing the next image ( breaks
for python it 's not that important . some packages they do change
no , the one for file transfers
or try to do it from a persistent root shell sudo -i
the default contains a huge amount of crap most people will never use .
any chance of a 'roll it back ' update
if the installer does n't see it how will i install it side by side with ubuntu ?
if you have ideas on how we could shave memory usage , that 's typically the problem . i 'm
erases the partition table on the disk .
more seriously , i have n't seen it , and i do n't believe that it works until i see
good good
no worries
actually put them in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
and since it 's a release issue , unlike a blocker or other..
yep now i got one to
it just causes hassle with things you 're about to do - what make and model is this system ?
it shows nothing here
sure one sec
if you 've got system settings up , use displays and disable the vga adapter 's display
oops , right
oh , i get it : - (
were you using headphones before powering off ?
forecast brackenfell
sorry , no idea there
experience with belgian beer as well ?
also the imports are different
sadly no cause 2 hdd 's died on me
i 'm applied that nat'ing retrying the juju bootstrapping . is there a way to test if it 's working
i was looking at the app a bit more - do we all feel it 's good enough for now
hp , cannon and xerox here .
type cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg | nc termbin.com 9999
before i go can you tell me how to run file manager as root ... .
what 's it called ?
have you got a crash file in /var/crash then ?
qtubuntu-desktop
he is the sdk dev working on it
hm , it seems on reboot my changes to files are n't persistant
paste it in paste.ubuntu.com please
another question : i 've seen some talk on the channel about how the final image will be delivered ,
can you read what i write ?
it 's not crashing , but the image is freezing and nothing is happening with alt+tab it 's fixed ,
after brute-forced ssh passwords , cpanel and webmin and the like are the most likely source of being hacked .
ok , did you use the gui or do.-release-upgrade ?
ok , that 's actually really useful info , i was n't even aware myself . let me have a
is this my system or yours ?
i do need a projector and screen
it will also mean you can copy/paste commands to , and links from , pastebinit rather than having to type
which laptop do you have ?
macbook pro ( retina , mid 2012 ) - this is what my about mac shows
in that case encryption would be useless . because only having your desktop session with a key would solve it
last time i unhooked one of the monitors , i could n't get my display working properly again .
ok , thats what you do n't need sudo for , what do you need sudo for ? ?
: d that 's how they roll
imtalking about activities - they are broken
perhaps sudo reboot
yes
can we fix silo 3 as well ? sees stuck
guess so , yeah , this was much easier since was simply [ re ] moving them : d
but i will take a look anyway
good to know ! flashing now . : d
well my pc did the same on a fresh install ( ubuntu 14.04 gnome/ubuntu 14.04 unity/linux mint/ debian wheezy -
there is a way to fix it in place though
ok
yes i installed it via sudo python setup.py install
*autsch* which one ? the one you reported friday ?
ok ... `` pastebinit < ( fdisk -l /dev/sda ) ''
kazam ( source : kazam ) : screencast and screenshot application created with design in mind . in component universe
yeah , but you might throw some mp : s showing example how to affect unity8 calling things that call
i only have access to command prompt
i do n't get pointer events..
i did n't say that was a promoted channel
gaoji
yeah , that 's cool
i was just confirming that your test worked
of course
well vlan does work from what i recall
well , ok - change something else then
that seems even less likely , assuming you 're talking about an x desktop . : )
fyi , i get it to load a document and to report that the document is a writer document (
cool -- fwiw , hopefully that error above will be enough to track it down
it 's command line but works well for making a bootable usb or otherwise transferring blocks of data from one
admittedly , it does seem a bit of a stretch to imagine , but i 'd suspect twitter has grabbed
i guess it wo n't boot with a zeroed fstab , right ?
yeah , probably . though i could also see them living on resourcemanager
my preference is one for system and one for /home
i can not make description viewable , but ... the weather icon is a condicator cloudy means there is a
it was , and loots of walking : )
one factory image one not-factory image
so translations almost work now
i 'm thinking of adding an error code field to some responses ( where there is none currently )
trust me - its minimal - i 'll even work a diff for that if you like : - )
ok , that was my alternate
should it be 'wontfix ' or such , as in 'we do n't really see this as a huge concern
do it in a bug
sync-monitor
run it in the terminal so you can see what the error is
except it could break your drive , sure
ah : d
it is not in the softwarecenter , is it ?
are you the point of contact these days ?
whoops
the issue is that broken or missing .desktop files wo n't show up in the panel
yeah
do you need more details before i refresh ?
to do individual tests quickly and to use the hud .
right , but not bootloader
there 's always the open store ... : - )
heh , i was thinking that earlier : )
then explorer.exe
seo does n't look at urls anymore
so , image 10 now needs to be checked if mms group-chat is disabled by default and there 's also
np : )
how i can do it ?
0 [ sb ] : hda-intel - hda ati sb
heh , no idea : )
do you know if bug 1425470 is desktop specific ?
thats something you should be able to add into xorg.conf though
fastboot and secureboot must be off to install ubuntu single
bear in mind this is on a tablet , inside xmir - will installing that break much ?
kk
not demanding anything , but a solution : there is no solution is not really helping , saying that i
something tells me that , if the machine is decently new and does n't do usb booting , plop is
i 'd wait until its more stable if you 're not willing to put up with possible bugs and the
if by wipe you mean secure deleting else just use gparted and format your partition
maybe you were n't there : -p
try rm `` -v '' ?
let me prepare everything for that
bark twice for yes
well , `` needs to be '' - > that 's the standard path to put examples into
right now if i have the slider then i can definitely select the thumb and rely on it
i 'm doing that now .
we have gimp files
then check if your mb allows for both video boards to be used simultaniously
you and i at least should be admins
the package layout is designed to prefer kernel-provided drivers if they 're installed , and dkms if not , so
not really .
nope
and i am pretty sure that this has nothing to do with my mp.. i will try with trunk just
apt-cache policy openssl
yes , i 'm doing 'apt-get update '
bah ! now it fails because of -werror and a signed/unsigned comparison
what that means is a single disk can read the boot-loader and boot part of the way even without md
back to ubuntu , i assume 14.04 ?
i missed one `` s '' but i meant these multimedia features , audio roles and playlist
i want intel in my host os ( ubuntu ) , gtx want give to guest .
yes and it 's a joke compared to i-nex ... . the funny thing is , when editing my fstab
*x on my system -.-
add it to the end of the line , and press ctrl+x to boot
gnome-screensaver-command -l and then tab ?
update then upgrade , update does n't install or upgrade it just sets up the available package changes to be
no , i just did 'adduser ' from what i remember
infer randomchoice { `` natefinch '' | `` wwitzel3 '' | `` ericsnow '' | `` cherylj '' }
it should n't matter actually
whats your question
that `` none '' meant the system had to ask you for a passphrase , even though there was none
the problem with this is that if we start a hangout for a pairing session , most of the time
you right i can enter like this but i would like to login with out asking such kind of password
the file adb.exe does exist there
ah , so the required interface has grown , i see
/var/lib/dpkg/status i mean ?
call forwarding works fine for pepephone
10.04.04 is n't that a desktop ?
ok
i will put primary . : d
yes , but check it
as for exporting all the menus , i agree , but there 's just not another way to do this
i scanned that ip for that port
so that we can ask shim the state of secureboot from it 's perspective -- basically , whether or not
reality
fine
ok ... so you 're currently booted into ubuntu and have the usb connected
yeah , i 've seen a bug and also tried to fix it with an intel command , but that
are you using coreboot if not your bios code to boot from usb might be nonfree unless uefi has some
wow , you 're not going to believe how simple the answer is
we ship it in the image
why do n't you use ppa ? there is a specific reason ?
yes plasma 5.2 is the default for kubuntu-desktop
some of the guides/tutorials were more this way , some were more that way
yes
we gave you documentation for that . no need for video
sorry , let me see .
which demo app ?
^
did n't the previous runs of these use kvm of jenkins.qa.u.c ? if so there was never any real issue
i only copy the numbers aahahah
define power
we get a heck of a lot of bugs subbed to us , it is easy to miss them ,
i just did a test , when you shut the screen off during the splash screen , the app does
i know people that use it successfully with a touchpad ( and some keys set up for button chording )
`` ls -al /etc/apt/sources.list.d ''
i can free it if you no longer want it then
why ? the open drivers are in the repos
could you file a bug against uitk with `` docs are not shown in contents view in assistant and qtcreator
i checked all the other endpoints , it seems us-gov-west-1 needs fixing as well
then no matlab . we do n't do cracks or piracy
may be a little less painful , im pertty sure we arent going to get any firsther in initramfs because
okay , i was hoping for issue event changes on a project
i 'm on the fence about that ; )
the only thing that maas would do is to give ip addresses via dhcp
smb3 supports and uses encryption
yes . do you want that network wide or just for the localhost ?
an mp against the store ?
ah , no , it 's fine .
cat /etc/issue
then alarm- > metaobject ( ) - > invoke ( alarm , `` save ) ;
ill roll down and cry and then do that
because i put my finger on all of them and only the motherboard chipset is burning hot
rename ~/.kde or ~/.kde4 , however it was called in kubuntu .
do n't worry , give this a bit more time too , might just be a big download
that socket is 0600 root : root right now
not by default ; i know some people have created hooks to do that , though
you should ask in # bash then
to the transition ppa ? !
no
yeah i thought that meant 2.19 above is too old
where can i find the solid system requirements for all of the flavors ?
no , i have to go
fix-device-actions
in unity it is standard on the left panel , dunno about gnome-panel
no worries can you redirect me ?
try to update mate
dooferlad , that 4.2 kernel bug seems like something is messed up with the hardware network stack - juju does
ahh , that makes sense too
it is a image update
the firewall probably only blocked packets coming into the ethernet cards or leaving via the ethernet cards ; when run
anyhow what does dkms status say now ?
i see
hi !
i 'll keep an eye on the builds and status
is it only for mouse-to-touch or also handle things like calling services like media-hub emulation ?
126 corrupts the uboot.env file by adding a value without a var name to it
i was just curious if you where gpt on the computer .
now what ?
yeah the card is a k2100m on a thinkpad w541 ( brand new laptop and new 15.10 installation )
i 'm assuming thats what you 're asking for - we have n't had extra cycles to devote to it
right , thats why i am testing the cheap ones
i saw the other day element of crime are coming to stuttgart
it 's probable it 's purely gcc arm problem still , so chris ca n't help
are you booted into the installation ? or a live usb ?
would you like to give a blurb or ?
hmmm
yeah , now that it 's been root-caused , we can let it through .
nope
right
i was trying export path= $ path : ...
strange question.. could it have something to do with me using and ssd ?
after grub , it 's show that it ca n't mount the root fs
neat ! !
you did read what i said , right ?
did you adjust the size in the .config file ?
one of the useful things to include would be lsub -vvvv -d 0c45:8419 to try and see how the panels
it 's essential for me : )
did youread my post about uefi ?
hey , good ! how are you ?
lp : ~dobey/pay-ui/adt-run-ap is the branch where i 'm hitting this issue
have n't gotten to do mor debugging than that yet , but in theory it is fully legit to read
you have the right graphics driver active ?
you 're building with the system go , and you do n't have the arm system go

yep still working good on wily
uh oh
what do you want me to monitor in particular ?
you can delete if need the space
mmm good question . i can do a bit of python and c++ if that is of any use .
because they do n't want you to copy/paste your e-mail address to the `` confirm your e-mail address '' field
in snapcraft , you basically have the package.yaml in the main snapcraft.yaml file
one can re-run that userdel , and it keeps failing in exactly the same way , stumbling over /etc/subuid
i assume you do some blending of kde and gnome yourself by your name .
possibly . i 'll look at those later . no big deal.. just wanted to play a bit with it
in the bug report its 3.19
alright , and if you bootstrap with `juju bootstrap -- debug` what 's the output ?
i 'd use the graphical partition edititor if i were you .
you can use `` ubuntu-device-flash touch -- channel ubuntu-touch/rc-proposed/meizu.en ''

try this command and pastebin the output . `` ping6 mail.moseley.ca ''
yeah , i 've tried that with my boss , it 's not that easy : )
lts-lts upgrade works , yes . but its 12.04 to 14.04 since lts is every second year
they are : )
i 'm just wondering why did this happen in the first place !
you live in brittain , you probably call `` sunny and hot '' the same thing i am calling freezing
can put you on the correct track
correctomundo !
then we can try to fix your card from 14.04
the echo command should do that
indeed . we also have someone at nginx willing to assist with security backports too which makes life a little

yeah , that demo was pretty killer
so does that mean that it looks like we 'll be ok , or that we have a problem ?
if there 's enough of a demand for it , someone will figure out a way to do it :
there 's like 14.04.2 ?

i am *detecting* the two screens though .
-r means recurse . it sets mode on all files and dirs in that dir recursiverly
yes

i am finding out how to generate one via google . i will get back if it continues to fail

yes
ok. try `` sudo apt-get -f install ''
i rebooted from a livedisk and i have run gparted
no , do not know that .
i know .
after we sync gstreamer versions , we 'll be able to dual land just about everything in the media stack
ahh i forget the command to have it show the progress bar , i knew at one point t_t
how did you get on with purpose and kamoso ?
i feel like the instructions ran during apt-get install took care of all that
ah , i agree that we should collect split greeter based plugins in the greeter dir . also that it
when did things go wrong ?
i appreciate you trying , but if you ca n't follow there 's probably no reason to try and offer
japanese is more messed up than chinese , cause it reduces between three character sets .
how about testing to create a new user and see if plasma works there ?
i proposed a spec , but it has n't passed through the system yet .
there was a translation regression in indicator transfer linked to buteo
see the recent thread on the mailing list
too slow !
that confirms it is a uefi boot , good . now let 's look at the partition tables on the

configure , in what way ?
no , n7
which release of ubuntu ?
machine provisioning and hook errors are a bit different : they 're coming from the iaas provider and the hook
it did n't even cross my mind that we 'd try to build a distributed lease manager *without* synchronisation
oh , i see the problem
ok whats optimum ram recomanded ?
well , it is not a mp , it is sync from wily to vivid
you could liveboot and mount the system , edit grub.cfg and add the desired line
it 's 2015 , why are you disabling ipv6 ?
but sure , you can testout lubuntu-desktop from your current ubuntu
that 's fine . just do your `crontab -e` and whatnot to go from there .
that 's easy , but not what we hoped
time to learn -- > # bash
yeah . now i only wonder if i can get a boot splash screen for my old video card .
df only shows mounted storage devices
any tutorials ?
true : /
new hardware is the most likely to fail .
fair enough . its not encouraged to do the remount though ?
i 'll redo fix
right , i still think we can write an autopilot test for this with some fiddling , we just need
ok , trying to actually make debian packages that contain go shared libraries now
yep , but unity-api *should* be released for both v +o & w , usually simultaneously
so it 's only a go 1.5 thing ? i 'm still on 1.4 and it 's fine for me
yep but time is precious
yes , once maas tells you the node is ready ( or deployed , perhaps ) , then , from
yep , sure
serial is the same ( 37 )
the question came up as we jumped back in yesterday and i figured we 'd just ask dimitern
ok
mhall119 , popey , davidcalle , balloons , standup time ! : - )
so crawl around that and f=watch what looks interesting
yes .
i doubt we log anything useful in that case : -/
why vaapi ? just curious
that works too , do that
indeed
in use by what ?
oh , it 's an iterator , nice !
i certainly *believe* that that 's what i 'm doing : )
what do you actually want then ? as you keep asking how to move applications
actually yes they are
yes , you 've said that three times now . i 'm afraid i do n't understand what you mean
our neutron dep-8 tests where a load of poo
what ?
there will be a call for nominees in the fall , it happens every 2 years
no , the other slaves all exhibit the llvm issue : (
+1 , that 's always the best way to go . if we like v4 we can relicense to say
hah , you got the same one it seems
and i can knock down the 100k testcase from 22 seconds to 15 seconds if i change snappy.chorder to be
are you 32 or 64 bit ?
i have just one hard drive connected . i am normal user
you 're behind a proxy
booted in the vm , you understand i believe . ; )
yep , already fixed that : )
and you have installed ubuntu over the whole thing ?
seems that do n't exist a updated plugin
popey is also all taken care of , so my work is done : )
if it 's not proper ubuntu it 's not matching the topic i would say
i have ubuntu 12.04 , trying to `apt-get install spellcheck` . but ubuntu package manager does n't have the package
yeah .. `` enable networking '' to provide r/w access to the partition .
man interfaces # should tell you how
yeah i 've had this install for ... maybe about a year ?
i literally installed , and used the included gui tool.. though , i can use arandr as well
okay , i will save that command on my desktop . : )
ok
here we may need magic voodoo : - (
what snapcraft are you using and i guess this is from a deb , right ?
booms
mine says , zoo not found you can sudo apt-get install zoo
always start with the main package name to uninstall
that is what i am saying
consider for a moment , dual landing allows me not to have to have 2 damn branches ... .only reason
k , i can drop it then ?
but this qtubuntu branch is meant to make qtubuntu bypass papi and use mirclient directly ... .
have a good weekend .
he is : p
ok , so the problem is worse than just the one changelog entry . i missed a bunch of changes
while not bootstrapped , start and attach to it , make your changes , exit , then bootstrap

does it seem like the 14.04.2 and 15.04 daily image problems should be fully resolved now ?
ubuntu got a bunch of kernel developers who actually work on kernel.org anyway . its just you jugding they are
yes
my systems all have a kernel command line of `` debug '' rather than `` quiet splash ''
right but this works in .2 and does n't in .3 which is a flaw our end right ?
this is the ubuntu support channel . why not ask here and anyone who knows can answer ?
you have the latest blender available in the ubuntu repos . for the newest release > > > wait for
no problem at all : )
sure , so for services they should be the same value , no ?
that would be not a ubuntu only issue . so better ask in # # linux or # # hardware
i had an 8.04 server around until a few months ago : p
damn with the ml ... i have sent it and it is in my sent mails folder
meh , i really really the auto-build of that package : /
the other option is just a late_cmd to `` locale-gen pl en '' ( or a subset )
where is the file articlecontent.qml ?
cool , ack
how am i suppose to do the install ? i have a keyboard , and a mouse ... that 's
if we change this and there 's a client that relies on this particular format of this particular error message
how is rsync different from cp ?
for what
how about that 1.9 bug ?
i did although when looking at the documentation the text and doc imgaes are fine but the theme images do
yeah you could say that

lots , it 's data your os has been or is using
it is a fresh boot

are you sure its a 64bit windows ?
i love my ideapad : )
that 's what i was thinking
well , we can clean it up manually , this is highly irregular
i 've got to go put boys to bed , but when i return i can point you at code

would you sponsor generating the ubuntu-mate-meta package generation ?
you can restart lightdm service ?

the fix should n't be too bad

no problem : d
no
ill look
lay your tarball/copy feedback on me : )
can i check from shell ? the gui is too slow to open the softwarecenter : (
leave them out - it 's a possibly valid case for maas
if you can jump into # ubuntu-app-devel when you can , it seems the ubuntu-ui-toolkit is broken on wily due

too easy.. and i know that command : /
i 'm here to discuss more if you come up with something
you have mutter ? ( 'which mutter ' )
i 'll be there saturday afternoon
there should be one method of finding all the tests to run
what point of the boot process do you get that error
yeps its looking good here too : d
try updating flash via the package manager maybe ?
well , you *could* do more sophisticated things than we usually do , but i do n't think there 's
you could try other sources perhaps
stop it .
i appear to have pushed something now ; )
what are you trying to do ?
it is maybe something to check
i dont think you have uefi
go outside and put a finger in the air ?
indeed

i guess im just a little flustered with how hard it is to cutomize that big ugly block on the

my calendar is very small , but bfiller and pmcgowan has the problem while syncing his calendars

that 's really strange though , the most common cause of that failure is that a higher version is already

they might send you back to ubuntu since ( afaik ) it 's an ubuntu patch , so you might
you can check with with `ps aux | grep [ p ] ulse`
see the bots message
can get the contribution stuff there as well
fixing that race condition is on my to-do list .
which machine ?
both double quotes
assuming the file exists , `` \efi\boot\bootx64.efi '' . if you 're trying to point to a default ubuntu install
does that mean the bad filesystem is mounted on booting ?
you just pasted your link a second time ? why ?
open the preferences dialog
you 're seeing things , it was n't in upstart_1.13.2-0ubuntu9_amd64.deb
hmmm ... is n't it normal for result params to have an error field ?
because they 're fubar : p
sleep well
thats what i 've been trying , i 'm talking to you and running the server here and running tf2
the `` : none '' makes me wonder at the end . seems it broke the architecture thing in the
i can reproduce the issue as well
i dont have 6 and 7 , only until 5
this is currently a stumbling block
why ?
( and if you know ) how to determine the version correctly
again ... `` sudo apt-get install software-center ''
ok
yeah , that 's my plan : ) and the workaround i uploaded will cover people running old init-system-helpers until
it will burn our laptops with more than 3-4 people
what should i 've avoided to prevent this problem
is n't it a systemd service ootb ?
okay , so i 'm not understanding what you 're saying , i guess . are you saying that it
ask away .
for example , i set a value of 16 , but it gets converted into `` 16 ''
no , i do n't agree , missing connection options is far more serious than just inconvenience
ok then you have it . convert should display the man page
look up the apt-get commands
is your silo ready ? i tried to install but requires gcc 5 now
as any time you remove stuff from the image
having a look now
no ... it 's enforcing that files have a newline at the end . as is qtcreator here . i
yes , tried both . see my paste above . neither work . the make aborts , and the error
because it was complaining it ca n't cast qobject to scopes
i in using 1280x768
: - )
i suspect the old upstart calls for start/stop/reload/restart may have been replaced with systemd calls
so why is 1.6 in a silo then ?
cool
/etc/network/interfaces
bleh
yep , that was what i thought : )
yea , that 's the wrong command
vim colorscheme is messed up
call forwarding and pin setting
i quite a few additional internal hds .
ok . i have to go out soon anyway , so will check later
the rfkill is there , i am asking where we should put it packagingwise
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
i can have a look if needed tomorrow if you ping me and know the package name
found newer drivers and they installed flawlessly
for some reason the qa bot marked it as fix released for 1.24
the pin lock screen is not a notification
yeah so `` halt '' by itself is a system command `` vagrant halt '' is a command to stop
that 's xchat tab completion
that should do the trick
and the machine-0 log ?
`` name or service not known '' hopefullly that 's transient
that would buy use time to sort out the issue
it will take some time . i 'm on a slower net
done.. that was a big bump in version
actually problem is even deeper
could you poke kenvandine ? since he 's working on u-s-s so he should know more about what that version
doh ! right . so very sorry .
even if i press the cancel button it continues to shutdown
i do n't immediately see a way to ... the problem is that it just takes writers
unless you change the screendump defaults , yes .
it sounds like you 've got 2 sets of grub installed , and the first is chainloading the 2nd
what first happened was that the file transfer to external drive stopped , and didnt ever resume , so that
do you know where i could find error logs for unity-gtk-module ?
i 'll brb
but debian/tmp is something which is being created as it is buildroot .

ugh , i just realized that a bunch of packages are getting removed during the test ...
right , ross was looking for a way to see all the studio packages
awe should we call for testing early next week ? specifically as the qt stuff touches in core dbus behavior
i will make an account however , if you think it 's a reasonable solution in line with my kernel/version
yeah , was n't installed
what are you trying to do with it ?
contentitem is a single item , not an array
errr ... /tmp/ !
get that click package i just linked to

yes .
it 's big on the 1080p screen too
i have only one
okay
any files ? /usr/lib/ ... .
the error output gives a command to fix it
ok , did that ... what should that change ?
that adds a lot of time waste in switching .
yeah , but there were several references pointing to the same issue ; i thought that would give it some
i understand that ... .but how does compute know what interface to talk to ceph-public-network ?
thought that was for ~200gb
no

for me it works perfectly for the very first time after ( power cycling the phone ? some random period
well your old branch was much nicer to work with than looking at what pay-service does : )

that touchpad issue is probably something in mir .
no guarantees though , i have n't tried anything like this

ubuntu installer does not offer the option to resize the partition

but if this one command is sufficient for your to abandon ubuntu , you have options . choose wisely .
no - it wo n't test vram but the shared graphics often consume some of the normal ram
i really think you should check your materials , because your issue seem far complicated from what it should be
that also covers the case where we *did* bind mount , but we already detached ; i.e . detach is

i also tried giving it a hostname , because the default seems to be `` localhost ''

before you reboot , after the installer is finished , you can use a terminal to test the passphrase does
sadly that 's the problem - it 's not working .
yes , i agree . but this is a good start as it may be affecting multiple things , and
well , it is because apps are n't supposed to be services to other apps
that doesnt answer my question either . are you using nfsv3 or nfsv4 ?
everytime it shows usb device is not supported
\o/
i wish i was : )
do you have this new root partition mounted currently ? if so , what is the mountpoint ? if not
there are such settings in ubuntu ?
check your additional drivers in system settings
you upgrading your trailer ?
if it 's ubuntu not kubuntu or xubuntu or lubuntu or whatever !
do you have a live usb ?
where abouts are you based then ?
: - )
my wish is it 's command
yet both the scanner and the printer work ?
then just revert the update
and to you : )
hah . well , maybe you undestand it a bit better with my above edit . : )
nope , looks good as far as what ubuntu 's bootloader sees and knows about ... we just ned to
oh , well that sounds useful
what are the errors
ouch..that doesnt sound very good , did you do anything unusual recently ?
oh , the iface name change reached us
my condolences
how do you best upgrade to 15 without ubuntu screwing up everything ?
published
not familiar with dd
looks like your installed the trusty packages
axw : it 's in 1.25 but not 1.24
you cant downgrade mate , install 14.04 fresh
i never faced this problem in windows ,
minecraft
where is that ? can you please be more precise ?
scored up a bit .
hmmm
actually , even easier : out = subprocess.getoutput ( 'your command ' )
sudo apt install lightd
not really ... i 've uh
what would it cost if we sent you an svg to print ?
okay
and as it 's something i have absolutely no control over , it only serves to make me unhappy :
that 's expected , but does n't mean it should n't be improved
can you provide any links ? or something
do you know which will work best for hosting wordpress websites ?
yeah , been ready for a while
ah , it 's probably not using format_sync , but async , but please try it anyway to get one
you can always re-install the metapackages once you 're done
does it have an active internet connection ?
no offense sir/mam really but i dont want help from you . i dont mean to offend but do i
i moved the jdk6 directory somewhere else , now i get java -version java not found .

i find myself formatting my notebook every 5 months or so and every time i do that i go through
question..
if i stop the agent and restart it , the former leader comes back thinking it 's still leader (

yea i can see them
\o/ it built
3rd party software does not include gpu drivers , so that shouldnt be it
dpkg-reconfigure maas-cluster-controller
ah yes . then use cmd .
nevermind there is no such binary ...
i do n't believe that supports snapshotting in the way it needs to for what you want
if you want it to run as your user then just @ reboot /path/to/command
you git repo should be the base for the packaging , should be added to launchpad too then
however , we are working on a untrusted community repository where you can then upload yourself whatever you want
when using foxyproxy , which proxy service do you use ?
the bug is in a different part of qtmultimedia ... it 's not creating the qsgvideonode instance
using a mock
sorry , cd /home/ < user > /.config/dconf
if so , then it will show us : )
there is your mistake , hell fire == chickens , lucifer == goats it 's the whole pecking order thing
wait , i 'm lost one one thing , can i use the new provides syntax today or not ?
# bash perhaps
ah
i am of a mind to try and reconfigure resolvconf . see then if we can get resolvconf to start
what color undies today ?
we did experimental landings through the spreadsheet to another ppa already ; )
is it apt-cache search packagename you seek ?
it 's more than the 15.04 base has .
it needs to be 5.4.1-1ubuntu7 not 5.4.1-0ubuntu7
yeah
well i do check ( ! alarmmodel || ! alarmmodel.count )
where in the world are you ?
it 's only the alias issue which was fixed for static but not dhcp
his 5 .
i guess somebody should review all the packaging stuff
i have onboard installed and it works alright
any idea when that could release ?
what problems are you experiencing ?
apt-get update ( updates your systems list of available packages from online ) then apt-cache search x ( searches for
that 'll do : )
lgtm
might be , i 'm running wily
well it does ... autopilot tests that uses uitk do
yes , but for keys that actually do something when the header has focus i would accept requiring the user
not i
also when you played zelda ; which one ? a link to the past ?
the pc is detecting wireless card but not showing any networks
yeah , but add the -- acls option if you need it .
oh , hi kde person .
for me , on my amd gpu 's , i just found i had to accept serious compromise
didnt know about that one
i thought if it was n't responding it would n't indicate a gpg error
talk to racarr , he knows more . but do log bug anyway
if you are using upstart , echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/lightdm.conf.override ( iirc , which i may not be
ah ok
its almost one of those once in a lifetime opportunities to be part of something special .
it ca n't handle bzr branches for g-c-c etc ?
check the bios settings -- and from the boot-meny try the `` memtest '' program -- it will display the
in the systemd package i worked around that by changing my patch to not create a dangling symlink , but
latest version too !
if we have docs in rst , can we easily import them into d.u.c ? how about markdown >
or use of threading
in some mother board yes ( not all )
racism and inappropriate language are n't welcome here .
also i made a small change to the unity-api branch after you had approved it -- saviq caught me not
so ur usb devices are not working ?
i got to run , sorry . someone else here should be able to help you out sooner or later
yes
there 's a big talk relevant to the whole of ubuntu is the idea
but both the new jenkins and the pilot testing results pages look awesome : - )
also as i told bekks , i am testing the connection with my mobile phone , through the 3g network
the right way to change it would be with an extension
will that work with the agents down ?
right , so your solution is one of two things . either upload to vivid and copy ( with binaries
i installed a couple of tools
mabe best rething this . see the outpur from ' apt-cache show kde-telepathy ' . maybe you really do not
that sounds like you suspended or hibernated windows , reboot , shut it down and try again
that depends , more on support level than age
dimitern thought you might have encountered this , or similar , when testing upgrades with qa and know a workaround
yep that certainly works
happy to be educated , or to butt out : )
the music app spanish translations ( and probably other languages too ) are too long for the various fields .
vnc tunneled through ssh , nxclient/nxserver , ssh -x
with the original os ? you mean the live installer ?
sure
trying in a while true loop now
ok - so we can remove any reference to it
right , my use case is untappd ( take photo and return to nothing )
well , you cant really call rollback before boot-ok in real life : )
you 'd have to ask openstack . it 's their project , not ubuntu 's .
do you have a usb dongle as well as internal wifi on that machine
there is no official backup process
ok try it now
nope , deleting cache did n't work
you could try su -l dave ... so that the env is properly setup
ok , yeah i mean it was nat masquerading between wlan0 and eth0 , just trying to see how to
i did n't think i messed with suite registration
and now build it for armhf : p
that 's not an ubuntu issue ; talk to dell
but regardless , if you set java_home and path correctly , you can put it wherever you like
add a new partition , choose your format
which the hook script does not handle
ctrl+alt+t
what 's your use case ?
would it be easier to use a dvd or usb ?
no you are not
it 's a literal ^ and a literal c
well , yeah , but it will re-read it when the app restarts ?
glad to hear it 's looking good . i got ta go , sleep well .
does it actually mention the flashplugin installer ? could you pastebin the entire message ?
false . knowledge is its own reward
just use pull-lp-source or apt-get source to grab the wily oxide-qt source , and then upload that to your ppa
then yes , ask away : )
just one little edit
and the move for `` not authorized '' was a real-world case of hitting an error that did n't end
the charms are just not designed for this type of use
the rest of the machines are running fine
i have to login to services ...
any particular tests ?
oh
k
did you get the email ?
those all sound like atomic replacement
ok , after i finish reconfiguring , try rebuilding it without the ignore_missing_twins flag even
yes because it is baked into a config file the user may change
yes , you are right , guest session woks
we have had issues with grants in ha configurations in the past but those where resolved issues - they materialized
so , i just plugged it in for the first time in weeks , i guess it triggered then ?
nope its oslo.db
shift does nothing
i need a list of pages that do n't work on the new site , but work on the old
well , that 's why i wanted feedback . : )
daniel just sent a mail that he wo n't show up today : (
wait let me check again
how do i get a release team establish for ubuntu mate with access to the tracker ?
pleasure
where 's the right place to poke btw ?
let me triage it and i 'll investigate
xubuntu ? : p
krita supports .color files that your user has access to .
oh so this worked fine before ?
< user > @ < host > is pretty standard , but passwords vary a lot .
i see , didnt actually go looking ; )
i needed the other hand to click the mouse
giffgaff with a non-recurring gigabag ?
the screen with the upgrade did stop ?
it 's literally all the same content - but again it 's not really duplicating
what are you trying to do in the first place ?
ok , doing . may be problemm in polish mirror ?
we do n't support menus yet
what behaviour omg
well working on it now , good of time as ever
no i did n't reported it yet
lp : ~ci-train-bot/unity8/unity8-ubuntu-xenial-landing-031 in particular
you should check the log files for reasons why it fails to connect . in a terminal do `` tail
yeah , both commpanies acted really great here
try kubunut then
that 'd be great
it 's just a regular workstation computer from work , nothing special about it , all generic really .
not yet . im trying to fix my samba server
there 's not much to say , this channel is for ubuntu support questions . simple as that .
on ubuntu-touch/rc-proposed/bq-aquaris.en 29 here
intel 's x64 is something else , x86_64 is called amd64 , it 's just a naming convention
yeah , always use proprietary drivers
yes
how big is it ? type du -sh /mnt/home
there 's a separate log file for your app
i 'm writing a reply , to hopefully calme he
there was a patch submitted by locutusofborg1 some days ago and i was on my way to sponsor it .
if your system fails to boot normally , it may be useful to boot it into recovery mode . for
fair enough : d
the kitsune squad is working with engineering teams to get what ci used to run for them transitioned over to
yeah , 22 hours ago a commit has been pushed
not entirely sure
is this interface enabled automatically , aside from the dns-nameservers being ignored ? ... can you pastebin `` /etc/network/interfaces ''
as far as i can see yes it is
you mean the moto g 3rd gen ? it fails the size requirements
i mean to set defaults
yeah , he was probably doing the experimental uploads , while recent unstable uploads were odyx .
yeah , agreed , i lived quite happily without it : p
# debian then please
i have an openstack private installation , all-in-one . the charm is a prestashop deployer - deployed it via cli
but then day after it doesnt again
awesome ; )
that works ; - )
ah , ok ... . maybe a broken upgrade ... . you were vivid and wanted upgrade to wily ?
ok , type cat /mnt/etc/fstab | nc termbin.com 9999
if you have time , could you take a stab at packaging gtk2-engine-xfce 2.9.1 ( yes , that 's the
and then use a copy command or can i use the gui ?
the guys in # freenode can teach you how to search for channels
thats ' why i said not to add the xorg-edgers ppa else along with the drivers showing up in a
what should i be looking for ?
preferably without
pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover
in ~ ?
backup .
imo , nothing really .
hmm its not in the index ? wth
try dpkg -l | grep `` mysql\|mariadb ''
i heard about ndk , which is the platform for native binaries
file does n't exist
what version are you running ?
go with partial unless you think the full one is worth your work
def the way togo
you need a provider first .
ive never had to mess with any conf
goes back to the hardcoded days ( but i have n't been able to remove all )
i 'm afraid you have to spend sometime understanding the server 's config ... : - (
that 's not the designed stuff
we can seed with an external file
it can be done , yes , if you hack it - mainly by copying the grubx64.efi to /efi/boot/bootx64.efi so
: o that 's why i chose it ; d
try vlc
you can have it all and keep it ; )
nexus 4 ?
huh ... i had tried that ...
no , i 'm telling you i just ran it on windows and it does n't make an iso -
i have check . but i ca n't find a way to load an mp3 and get a txt .
ahhhh wait no , got it !
then open a bug report , attach the artifacts , and point us to it = )
mm works here *shrug*
ok try 3.4
if the `` install ubuntu '' option is absent , that typically means you are looking at a currently installed
you load them back like you originally did .
yes i tried that , but there is no layout there
add more top and bottom padding to sections
that it does n't really apply to the click world ?
do n't call kevin 's baby ugly
i know i lead the funniest life you 've ever known right ; )
sorry broke is the wrong word here - it misbehaved . it polled the charm store .
the hell
i will find out next week
there are no iphone apps in ubuntu
if i add the /plain part it asks me to login , anyways it 's the same as mine
armhf is also 32 bit , curious that it did n't affect that
^
excuse me ?
did you edit the pastebin ?
so one thing that is still keeping it from running without me manually doing something , is that it seems
i popped into there , and i really really wanted a flowchart of how this was supposed to operate
because if not , then the tracker is getting signals that the bug is being fixed ( again ) yesterday
it 's cause you closed all the bugs but nothing 's been published yet .
in the phone ?
you can increase further with software using xgamma
ok , i will just reboot back into ubuntu
you can wipe the text afterwards on that cloud ?
no , you can just do-release-upgrade
userna < tab >
how do you know ?
ubuntu-rtm/landing-002 - gst-plugins-good0.10 , qtmultimedia-opensource-src , qtmultimedia-opensource-src-gles : rsalveti
i will definitely do that , i appreciate the offer
# ubuntu will sort you out
no . the merge should be really easy if you know your branch
i 'll discuss with abeato tomorrow . after a quick re-check , there are ril commands that can be used
personally , i would just test the hard drive , and other hardware.. since , it could be an older
right , and that works fine for re-evaluating network-online.target itself , through the extra `` wants '' in the ifup
they 're following the gnome schedule more or less , so a couple of weeks
ah , bug 1333215
still not seeing the warning : ' (
try `` sudo umount -- lazy /dev/sdb1 ''
why does n't that work ?
the help message probably should n't say a silo number limit at all considering it 's not enforced and sooner
add `` using jdbc '' and you 're in the ballpark
something like usermod -d /path/to/new/home < user >
if it 's *only* on ppc , they might be doing atomics correctly , but missing -latomic .
so it must be that /home/creeper loading , try to create another user
oh , er , is that a new thing ?
i 'm not so sure about this stuff , that 's all i know
yaya
if you dd to the device , it will overwrite the partition table
can i ping you in 10 ? after standup
someone trying to sneak packets through nids is my first guess
^^
snappy list
you mean tough
you do n't have to do the @ sign
so login
this is one of the reasons i 've set up this vm .
if a user chooses 3 grub issues === > openterm/link==== > back to menu and be able to choose
but i do n't run anything `` exotic ''
did n't you hard reboot for the grub issue ?
great . now try `` configfile /grub/grub.cfg '' , which will hopefully load your installed system 's grub menu .
so last question , this command : find /opt/jdk1* -type d -exec chmod 0755 { } \ ; will give
oh really ? perhaps i did n't check well enough
if root ( / ) is no /dev/sda1 and ( /home ) is on /dev/sda2 then if you format /dev/sda1
and returns common-nfs related error when install most of the packages
err , ignore that ... tab mistmatch : )
most errors i saw with that exact message came from using it with sudo
sudo apt-get install lm-sensors fancontrol
but yeah same issue here , when add folder to places it 's gone after restart
and is it true that has not been built with 5.4.1 ?
congrats
i do see a change to how local provider was getting its ip address . i wonder if it was
then have at least as much as ram . prob 1.5 - 2x
it 's like switching accounts
i hear footsteps
do you have a log or anything else written up somewhere ?
on it
did you mean overrides for restricted ?
odd o.o
heh , easily done i and answerd with the wrong nick , doh .
and the indicator is not showing ? is it installed ? ( dpkg -l | grep indicator-messages )
-rw-r -- r -- 1 root root
yes that 'll be covered , i mean the way to test a put to the services resource and how
sure . here 's what i 'm trying to do :
north american has different bands than the rest of the world
i gave up on unity and use xfce .
again ... for x86 you need ubuntu desktop , not touch
but the crash is definitely occurring in oxide .
who/what removed them ?
surely it is allowed . though your body might disagree .
i thought you removed that code
one sec
ok cool
correct
i tried `` -- suffix v5 '' ( which works in debian , for nmuing ) , and that works
ok : )
yeah
we 're building master branches of all kf5 and plasma
bye ! : )
yw !
i have to open my log files to get at some of that scrollback
i am sure he is a good kid but if he does something that is going to harm him or
let me echeck
you get to choose when the cd is bootet : install or try . ( but with try out you
yeah , it 's a little annoying to factorize stuff ...
you are saying there is no way to recover my data ?
only the entries where the argument is `` unwrap '' ... so when your script triggers it should be related
try flashing a device with wily . the welcome wizard 's responsiveness really is far ahead of everything else
ntpdate on boot for a ( potentially large ) jump to mostly correct , and ntpd to fix jitter .
: )
i rotated the phone : )
i answered that
i see
why am i getting a duplicate sources entry ?
why ca n't you upgrade ? things are n't really going to improve on 12.04 in the future
i know , but i did n't change them : (
it 's all good . i tried with en , fr and es . are there bugs for the click
you got yourself a lot of problems
that 's what worries me
whatever we do to dkms , ultimately i 'd like to see less of it being used
so , should be good enough for developing your tests while that happens ( or the rt gets done )
i 'll apply for ppu very soon
strange ...
it can be
aaaaaah !
i have chrooted now and can use apt but when i try to resolve things . it says e :
something created /dev/mapper/crypt_sdc9 , if it was there before you tried my 'cryptsetup open ... ' suggestion
no i18n support
but , good catch
ah , yes , i remember that video .
that makes sense
no i know but i mean when you 're building images like , for example , right now i 'm
telnet : unable to connect to remote host : connection timed out
can you get the logs for that one ? ( as you pinged us about it , you know the
with x everything is possible
headphones should be ... headphones ...
does the pc have hybrid optimus gpus
we do n't build it on ppc64el , so none of the binaries works
what is your oem-config issue exactly ?
yeah , i guessed so
no there is no kubuntu-plasma5 in vivid that was just temporary in utopic
let if blank , unless you have connections problems
so both you could n't ssh with either key
works like a charm on nexus7 though ...
it 's so strange . i know it has bluetooth because i had multiple devices connected when it was windows
sohuld be ~ 250 kb instead of the old ~ 40 kb
try sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
yes ... as i understand it , client attaches to gpsd causes it to start talking to the device
l
it gets to the point of booting okay and can do update & & upgrade , but lacks a lot
do you know in the xorg log what does `` compiled for 4.0.2 '' mean ?
ok , type del /f /s /q /a `` e : \efi\boot\bootx64.efi ''
just activate some process and inspect its env ; )
oh . no .
see the links the bot gave you . where you can contribute depends on what skills you have .
right , maybe i misread .
yes , then you can enter reset
ubuntu online summit
reboot ?
good catch !
yeah
you are not comparing something inside curl , you just need the value of $ 2
cool . we have a user on # juju that evidently had a problem with restoring his state server
noteon : to complete this , you can also only install a text-mode ubuntu : )
also , after adding someone it 's always a good idea to send them a link to the editor 's
i was saying you could grab a usb wifi card on the cheap
me too .
i am only stating that the ddwrt firmware did this automatically for me , by providing a dns server
^^
oh fair enough over to infinity then
yes , i 'm using vmm now and i can see graphic screen with a mouse cursor
iso-create ?
never done it before so unsure of the process
no , just set the bios to uefi and reinstall .
then $ $ great $ $ : )
apparently we never upstreamed the previous fix ... i 'll send a merge request upstream with the two combined
no but how do i accomplish it after preseed on the first boot
heh
try networking in dolphin before resorting to samba
thx
go to # # windows for windows support
$ parecord foobar.wav error de flujo : acceso negado ( access denied )
and in fact i 'd like to merge testbed-packages into this one
no , there is still ff/tb at least ...
makes it so i do n't have to touch provider/all/all.go : )
that has to happen in the cru loop each time when we call updateversions
something , on your network , when asked , is/was/has provided that resolution
if you have not made apt-get autoremove you should have the old kernel ... ls /boot ?
many users installed touch on nexus5 , so i presume dualboot will work too
henrix : assuming that it builds okay , i 'll queue it up for 3.13-stable immediately
yes they dont mix well either
awesome - i was having a general run through the charmset inc the openstack charms today
you do n't have linux installed there
then that 's probably the problem
this way works ; most things do n't have that many options for it to be problematic
it 's setup like all the others
where was it installed before ?
let me read . give me a minute or two .
but i seriously doubt that we can make something as complex as unity8 work from a temp unpack dir
do n't worry i am also joking : p
which makes me think what you and your snappy skynet did to make this happen
it calculates assuming they 're removed .
debian bug 771980
apparently not .. disc is in but being ignored or something
i meant for you to try it for your self
i also built 2 extra armhf ones yesterday to align the image number , just to make it easier to
do you have ubuntu installed ?
yeah , that was likely some manual thing around gcc transition
good to know
i see it . and you tried to change your account naame ?
there is no /tmp/snaps on edge
btw where do i move that mgmt folder out to ?
pm
ah , i see what you 're saying , file a wish-list bug against lp : ubuntu-sdk to create one
i 'm already sending daily notifications to his email
those are exactly the same as the dkms module and built literally from it
you mean in the gui ?
or just fix the missing applet
no , i 'm building it inside of cdimage
maybe do a tail -f /var/log/dmesg and tail -f /var/log/syslog while you running gparted , for errors
btw i finally managed to get a fix for the resize problem
if this approach is what we stick with , i 'll update o-c-t bundles
i can see only ssd and hdd..
that may explain your failure ...
hm , that commit description is equally wrong/confusing then
the problem is that there 's a 32gb extended partition and its using only 16gb for the recovery partition at
pretty sure that 's what my /home uses and it does n't work for me . well , did n't
for local tests , that 's `` dpkg-buildpackage -b '' versus `` dpkg-buildpackage -b ''
2gb will be slow , no getting around that
what the real , ubuntu-related question there ?
: x
they are doing a lot . most drivers you use are made by volunteers since the drivers the comanies give
he is a troll ignore him
yes whole suite
: d is it a wily werewolf ?
so is the `` dropbox '' package installed ?
then sarnold is correct , you should have a local charm cache in ~/.juju/local/
do nokia 's still sell ?
sure , not asking for all issues - but you obviously have some ideas here , so would be good
it 's $ { project } _binary_dir
be careful , very few people `` need '' newer versions than the versions shipped with the distro
kk
ok , which driver is it using ? it looks like a font issue . might be worth disabling the
looking at -icon-theme there is literally only one icon in there that needs to be ( or should be )
prima , danke !
do n't worry , we all have different skill levels
100 % failure rate across amd64 , ppc64 and arm64
that should be faster , because we could create all the partitions in one go and keep track of state
and actually i do n't imagine a `` maintained by debian but with a small upstream bump for totem 3.14.2
use the intel driver ?
i guess working on that appearance thing you mentioned would be for xfce 4.16 , we should really focus on
with what app you make the live usb ?
why would'nt that change anything ?
can you `` sudo systemctl disable powerd '' for now to get that pesky 90s timeout out of the way
sudo parted /dev/sdb -l
i already have libpackagekit-glib2-dev
i meant to look at it , i suspect its a race in some way , but i 'm not
i did a 'sudo apport-cli ... ' and then pressed v , and it started dumping dots .
without the package , it works , the accounts dialog ui shows
command was ran with sudo ( and was included in the paste )
bulk photo processing .
for that second bug , neutron-server is not supported on nova-cloud-controller - you have to use the neutron-api charm
i just saw your comment wrt licensing
( sysvinit-core is only in debian , so grab a copy of the unstable deb and list contents , should
is that guaranteed not to screw anything up ?
yeah , working fine now
`` sudo '' lol .
well that 's why i say if it used something like snmp that would kind of work
any news , or am i just calling this good enough ?
sergiusens , chipaca , so i have a working edge rpi2 image now ... but i cant install any snaps

oh wow . hours and hours later ?
the `` network-manager '' is dump . you also ca n't remove the network-manager without purging `` ubuntu touch ''
i believe exactly that is implemented in the branch above
so proc-name is the juju-name for it , and id is the plugin 's name
apparently my sata mode is set to raid
right , but it doesnt
no , see cfhowlett 's message above ^^
dang . okay .
excellent ! let 's see how it goes ( keep us posted , i 'm interested ; ) )
but that would need as well backporting to the lts to be useful , so more work
i like him . he 's a helpful guy , with an attitude xd
remember to buy grim fandango for the plane trip to brussels : )
sounds good
yep just taking time to load up then , give it a while and it should have the full desktop
well , we 're only filtering whatever lxc_bridge is in agent config
ok
no
so , currently ( as of last night ( ! ) ) we have a logger that logs things to

yes i saw it
but when i let it dump the qml-item tree the source : line for the shell is shell.qml where it

is there someone who 's described the steps to port an app ?
`which ufw` returns nothing
probably a preferences setting . if you have no open files , should be safe to delete

lvm isnt designed for protecting you against drive failures , raid is .
bah !

i highly recommend you adopt that test pattern i sent in a mp , and test cases where you have

i 'm not an expert on this area , just info on another area to check , basically a standard

yea it looks like that the 13.1 driver was the last to support that card . that said , you
cool , yeah , i 'll definitely have to keep that in mind ( especially since many of these servers
ok so it 's a system with both intel + amd hybrid graphics
i 'd guess xsettings
yup
because it was polling the charm store otherwise .
its a zip file , do i have to do something to it before trying to use it ?
no , merge removed the carpet from under this branch 's feet
i expect that 's it
is this really the same code as on developer.u.c ?
one sec
i did n't realise till after that he was in here though : )
in the same that switched to the new way of calling it - at least in theory
i really dont think thats the issue , friend
i defer to alexabreu on if html apps are affected on the release
right , just curious how i can import the code at a specific tag in svn
for about 2 months yes
great
try aptitude install php5-cli
did n't work.. i tried disabling nvidia optimus on bios
do sata cables deteriorate ?
i see , well ping me if i can help with something else
nice one
np , just ping me whenever you feel like
ok , then ?
this one
you can always manually deploy openstack services using juju
because on my vivid desktop it always returns 0 , even when i toggle the visible switch in the indicator
it is , except when it 's not . but yes , more disk is the better option .
oh , how do i use that ? i 'd rather not have tests running as root
you mean a command line only system .

if you 're using the actual efi boot manager in `` modern '' mode yes

yeah but i am going to erase this disk and replace it with ubuntu when the usb is done :
ooh fooey
do n't canonical have a plan to make use of android apps ?

but no there was no specific reason for that from my memory
did you get all debdiffy and come up with what you think is a sane plan ?
so sdb1 is the `` /boot '' partition ? where is the `` / '' partition ? is it sdb5
with a desktop ?
was n't sure that was you , you lost a ^
there are a lot of different fixing methods . i generally make sure the thing is warmed up and pliable
ahh
is your local sbuild configured to build against wily-proposed , or only against wily ?
new image build , or mount the .img and remove the dangling link
we can replace the proposed version with an other fixed version while in propsed . maybe 1.24.5 can be put
no .
out of the box ?
but i just have a cron job on my server at home which rsyncs from my laptop . if the

yes .
heh , i know about this expression ( but yeah , no litteral translations in french ) : )

yes i did , initally there was also a zfsonlinux bug ... but that got fixed ...
i wonder if this could be changed to be a `` platform operation '' instead .
do you have graphics problems right now ?
or tail -f /var/log/syslog while you gaming

here you can see that downloads from the maas controller fail
nothing urgent - just need go over storage , health etc prior to seeing mark
your steps in your test case confuse me
any port ? not those you specified ?
greyback__ : this error appears to be because the train does n't support syncing packages it does n't own ,
yes
just ran `sudo mount -a` and the grub-install still gives the same error .
if you wan na see something really cool , go look at ceph . they actually use math to figure

i 've learned like 10 things in this process , so i 'm also grateful .
whatever is easiest for you guys . *i* do n't care what the name of my branch is
the latter already exists
why does everything have to be so complicated ... sort of ruins the beauty
i know
your choice ; )
lovely
ok : - )
looks like you 've got overclocking
another thing , xenial development branch is not reccomended for server use right
oh , maybe you have to import webkit .
but that requiers to download a lot of .iso 's

any idea when your plasma-nm package will be in wily archive ?
what version of kubuntu are you using , and what gpu ?
done .
what 's the server for ?
what do you see after the login page ?

ok
yes , set that package on hold , using apt-mark
did you get anywhere with qapt3/muon packages or shall i look into that ?
why do you have so many vms ?
of course !
one of the trains has wifi on board
those are the official train packaging guidelines , you should probably look it over . review looks good for what

some page on ubuntuupdates
right , we 'll fix the bug , but it 'll take a day or two
you used propriety drivers ?
what desktop is it exactly ?
sudo sed -i 's/precise/trusty/ ' /etc/apt/sources.list
so `` overlay '' is looked up in the hierarchy of parents ?
good point
robru finished the dual-landing feature
no , regular boot session with kde . the problem fs is an external drive
indeed . i compared the system-boot and they look similar on my image
it 's very nice for monitoring and reporting things
then your query has no relevance to this channel : )
it should read 9.81 m/s^2 at rest when oriented on one of the axis ( flat/upright/on the side )

so did qa test a not-fully-built silo ?
details added to bug # 1498631
fdupes dirname
why is that ?
and the mouse coursor does not change its icon when i move over links
yes , the stereogram one .
so there is no uncommented cdrom line now ?
tell the installer not to install a bootloader
me too , but it will be fun anyway

that could very well be . i just read that installing nvidia-prime is as easy as `` sudo apt-get install
more like what ?
i guess it 's because it 's never uploaded to ubuntu , it 's a lp-made sync directly from debian
yeah , i 'll drop it since you 'll have everything fixed for me : )
cursors are so small
the command above works on my krillin but i had ubuntu on it previously . should n't really matter though..

there is no mention of phones in that bug report : - ]

there 's a github mirror , but it 's not used for development

i 'm pretty sure that would n't help .

you should have , do you filter launchpad emails to a spam box ?
we will not repeat ourselves again , either clean install a supported release or upgrade to 14.04 .

for driver support , ubuntu stays the best
the per-app upstart logs are just logging stdout/err to a predetermined file , amirite ?

so not combining the qt sources but combining the other -gles sources ( uitk , qtmir etc ) sounds better

older machines run better sometimes on older versions

it most certainly does happen with the current version .

great !
no
it looks like it 's not configuring the hardware codec properly
and you ?
wich gfx you got ?
doesnt got your version from your paste weird
ok , if they 're not used for upstart fair enough
it did n't have a partition because i had to recreate the partition table
oh , possible it 's doing that silently , let me check

what relevance does disk usage possibly have at this point ?

i disagree .
i gots to try that next

thats on a desktop , right ?
someone did

was that directed at me ?
because kernel has non-free osftware and other repo have non-free software

yeah is this your first linux computer ?
elopio yep , 14:00 utc would be fine
by scopes i mean oauth scopes ( the checkbox you asked if i had clicked )
no problem : )

that 's moving it from iteration backlog into actively working
hmm , missing grammar !
ok , no problem . i did n't know why that was needed - your changelog entry did n't say
probably , it was already night central time
i am going to tell you that the password i have no one else has .
i would n't leave one of your x86 images high and dry like that , but yeah . ppc users
technically there 's a possibility , feature freeze jan 5th ( = 1-2 working days in january ) , final
oh ... design nixed it in a different context . maybe they would n't mind in this case
yep that 's been supported since the beginning .
empty mp commits work fine still , right ?
this are new ones right
try `` grep -i ahci /var/log/dmesg ''
just , try to read it , if you fail , move on
third party right ?
we stole everything useful from cut the rope ; )
does it show up ?
it is lxde with qt as far as i heard
yep ! : )
no
it implied that people who spoke the lang were `` special '' somehow .
fixed : )
^^ sudo apt-get install pastebinit ; dmidecode | pastbinit .
how did you configure your ethernet then ? and which ubuntu do [ d you use ?
if you recall , it is looking at the .json.additional file in /var/lib/apparmor/clicks
: d
are you asking if that set of password prompts is the way that is supposed to work ?
good afternoon : ) wanted to see if this was on your radar yet ? bug 1497301
yeah , take a look at the metadata.json file
wily werewolf , latest dev
yeah , that was my scenario too
yeah no sign of anything else at all . confirm it 's 14.10 with `` cat /etc/issue '' ?
well i just stole your macro : p
yes , just ask
k
all this would be to the channel , not me is all .
that would be awesome !
please follow directions exactly , or at least make it clear when you are modifying them . troubleshooting is that
thx 4 link
that would be a lot faster overall - more than enough to offset the encode/decode overheads
yes , there 's that . if this thing will stay running long enough to do so . i do
'additional drivers ' ?
what options do we have ?
it 's hard to distinguish sometimes what counts as `` work on ubuntu phone '' as opposed to `` work
cooool !
sure
so it 's likely that while sdb1 contains windows ' bootloader , there is n't actually a full windows installation
yes ... but there is a virus that deactivates the led
there 's a link to a deb built by paulo
but i doubt i can really help you because i never used any touchscreen device with ubuntu / :
looks like updated version 2.15-0ubuntu10.10 not available in the repository .
install unrar
you 've bug report in the mp line ...
sure
the difference in runs is with -x and without it . autopilot3-sandbox-run -x runs under xephyr . autopilot3-sandbox-run runs under
it is not a bug
now to get it on my device..
damn the touch stuff daniel did seems not to be working the same : /
its the edge demo that have the issue , wrong use of the work `` wizard ''
: )
super , i give it a try
yeah , i 'll take a look soon
did you ask him to view the logs for his window manager ? check x11 logs ?
now you 're getting to something worth saying
but it reaches the desktop now without needing nomodeset ?
what is `` it '' and how does it fail ?
says alrady configured / installed
the second command errors out , soemthing about process . the third worked by itself
15.08 is n't final yet
alright : )
i ca n't
np , happy hunting
launchpad.net/ubuntu-website-content
why not just install lubuntu ? ?
but they added that .
ty
as tomb is private to the stringsworker
tput ll # move to last line , first column ( if no cup ) i use tput for colorizing
yes , wil do
yeah i know , but i have no choice .
no problem , if that dosent help just say and ill keep looking
which ipod
ah
you are younger than us ! : )
probably not : ) next time , please make sure to ping ubuntu-qa , that 's the highlight we all

i do n't get scientific with my own equipment , and my work is too lazy to measure like i
what is that ?
what driver + grafix chipset plz ?
libpion-dev depends : liblog4cpp5-dev , liblog4cpp5v5 . ben does n't have any smarts to match on package name boundaries ?
is that also the main obstacle to adding other sub-repos under the merge bot ?
and in task manager you can-t understand a thing because it-s all grey
could you reconfigure it ? ... i 'll wait for silo 10 to land before building
are you doing ssd + hdd set up ?
do n't disagree with you about it should be a service . # works in crontab ... good . will
it 's just a warning
vendor : intel
laney : i filed bug 1423811

and charm hooks are ordered with actions as well ? e.g . juju set ... juju action ... juju set
irc version of saying `` where i said 'will get you ' i meant to say 'should get you '
i still do n't understand what you mean by that

`` the problem with setting instance status is that it 's stored in the instancedata doc for the machine ,
but it 's already different
also my krillin advertize itself as a computer on bt , is that right ?
systemctl enable < service > ?
what row has the combined landing ?
no , more testing
are you in recovery mode still ?
inspecting that commit
reverted , and the hack lives on in .~1~
that theory of mine is out the window , as intel `` just works '' .
another silly question : > is there a way to stop parsing the adb args ?
when do i do a sudo service start it shows that its starting but it doesnt show up anywhere
your irc presence betrays you : )
i *want* to keep the stuff that is there , separate
yes download libdvdcss from the videolan site
nope . i was mostly uninvolved
... apparently , sometimes , if you suspend/hibernate ( under windows ) and then resume the gpu *may* appear .
that means it 's published , but did n't pop up in the -proposed pocket yet
heh , that was bad english
yes , man clamav for commands
hey , so if you always want the latest and greatest ( along with potential bugs ) , use the
the default with 15.10
keep talking : )
we only mounted one ; ) it was a test ... you can do this
you ca n't edit the original doc ? anyway , no , it says i do n't have the permission
google-chrome uses peper flash .. what is the problem ?
kyrofa : also , how can the two fixes be checked ?
indeed
also check the system settings > multimedia > music > audio harware setup tab for the same otput as listed
so basically the change that needs to be done in go.js is not the one i suggested , but the
unplug the windows disk and see if it boots
that is not what i am after ; )
yes that is a c coding channel .
meh , in our environment , we do n't really care about the distinction .
any luck ?
who is fixing that ?
shenmegui
already fixed
no i am not .
do not ever use wubi again ! 1. it 's broken . 2 . it 's not supported 3. it
as long as i try , i ca n't solve that issue
were you able to get that stalled process stopped or moved to the background ?
good deal .
you should come to southeast linux fest and talk about your love of testing and autopilot !
yes
the decision on how you prefer losing your data is all up to you : p
yes please . but , i 'd also like ubuntu-mate-artwork in the archive is possible .
type ls -l /sys/firmware/efi
but , if i may pm you ?
already committed to git
assigned in the sheet , qa should get it on the queue in a moment
and it 's not wrong to be sending all those logs to stdout
alright
oi , that 's a longer term decision , but running -devel is fun
pretty sure jose `` brought up the plan ''
diff agrees with you
are you using the tools ppa ?
lts
ok
what version of ubuntu are you using ?
this channel is for support of kubuntu - a linux desktop operating system - you might be better off joining
still a long way until the transition : p
by full reboot i didnt mean long pressing the power button , i meant using the shutdown option
its not even 24hours released
i 'm trying to work out how to help progress some of the critical bugs that have been picked up
well you have to help me understand your setup before i can tell what you 're up to , so
ok , so power off is the only real option
xangua everything is on the same partition
ah there we go , put that rule in /etc/udev/rules.d end see
tarmac is bound to bzr
i can grab it still if you need though .
interesting , printing stuff derping
well i have samsung evo 850 - not had any issues that i 'm aware of
do you accept hugs as payment ?
is that in 15.04 or 15.10 ?
i was also having this tearing problem in vlc and unchecking it has also fixed it there . what do
so this was an abi break yes ?
this is n't still chromium is it ?
lightdm just needs to be able to tell the compositor which session to set as active
good to know
yeah it didnt make it
done
and you 're waiting for bootok ?
`` untrusted application launcher '' ...
yes , wo n't these changes affect existing tutorials ? ( as in : are they based on sdk templates
there is none
oh , good
so i still see it on the desktop unless i compile my own qtmir
^
it applies , but is missing the have_gio_unix line from the mir backend which was added later . commenting on
i proposed a branch , we 'll see if osomon hates it : )
command-line/terminal
it opens an interesting question about what other aspects of the charm could be considered 'legacy '
your last 5 lines do not answer what i asked you : )
i would go lightdm , can be changed though after this .
ok , so the thing should wake up for almost any activity
yeah i guess it makes sense that the error message would come right after the error . and now that
wdym ?
you better believe it ! ; p
inset day tomorrow , they are off but am working from 8:30am
you could use auditd and log accept ( ) syscalls ; that would apply to all programs , without requiring
in some dualboot cases , sudo update-grub can do magic also
^- more useful than single-arch docs for most people : )
does it segfault without listitemlayout ?
nothing as far as i can see from the updates available .
well , i can not test ...
not really.. why ?
correct , its using nouveau right now
i didnt know there were ui-less things ! actually i 'm sometimes a bit annoyed that navigating through ppa /
+1'ed with a suggestion
hm , i can ssh to it ; maybe you are n't on the company vpn ?
well , it seems ok now after the mesa upgrade
that 's more of a topic for # ubuntu-offtopic
most webpages mention other version of ubuntu then 14.04 for gvfs-mtp
ok so you manually installed from their site
8 mbps
inputwatcher just monitors input evets received by its target
tomorrow at 1400 utc work for you ?
ok but what 's the proper command-line to test my locally unbuilt , modified source tree on the device ?
we ca n't stop that . you can set ignore on them though
and you continue to say its super cool to run an outdated unsupported os
they look good now . i am going to test this for a 2-3 days to ensure that we did
i 'd like to be able to run diff -u lsusb-vvv-working.txt lsusb-vvv-not-working.txt
did you see any other package being installed besides the ones from the silo ?
\o/
what 's your launchpad account ? i 'll start an ec2
i 've got a dhcp server on raspberry pi on my network and the power reseted today so raspberry rebooted
centos & fedora are rhel : d redhat usually uses them to try new features before integrated them to rhel
is it something done during the node deployment ( by maas ) or something done later ( after juju started
you can post it ?
sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
your message got to me first though , you beat me fair and square : )
sounds good
wich ones
great
this does n't have a `` desktop '' entry in the manifest , so there is no .desktop file in
i assume ubuntu silo 005 , right ?
your card shows cuda on the website right ?
oh , i see
for the core apps yes . the intention and design is to pull them from the tool qa uses directly
that 's a plugin btw
ok
ok , i see a few problems
the bootloader
or does it come by default on kubuntu ?
the important thing is , that it did n't happened since re-install
you 'll never get a jopb at fifa with that attitude
it should be under boot options
the previous runs had other tests failing
i will mount it from outside from the host . i did not know i needed it earlier . now
let meknow if that works
meh sorry something else all together
do you use digikam ?
did n't do anything after restarting lightdm
nevermind
yeah would typically recommend just using the additional drivers dialog for installing drivers
you 've got mail
i just asked in # ubuntu-release
i ca n't reproduce it with that
does it work in unity but not in lxfce
yeah , my issue is getty ( i suspect ) is somehow trying to `id ubuntu ' and it ca
is it possible to move a unit from one space to another ?
you should try reading we webserver logs..
probably , it 's a perf degradation , right ? or do you actually see a crash/hang ... ?
those boot images are n't small
if you wish to maintain said project anyway . : )
nothing about ubuntu/linux/pulse/alsa prevents skype from supporting it.. but , to stay constructive , for the end user , there
?
yes
and that was wrong advise
note that the minimal installer is a little bit harder to use than the normall ubuntu installer , and about
that does n't change the validity of my statement .
that sounds familiar
that will not solve your problem with deleting /media/ross/opensuse-13.2-dvd-x86_640051/home
stop does nothing to apparmor
they definitely have the model written between the black slots lower down , so i 'd give it a good
unfortunately all this is *not* enough to make the generated lxc conf take effect always
yes , but the vm does not have access to the intetnet
yes , using the wily version
bzr add
yep , that 's why i proposed the fix and got the silo
it all depends what you are running .
no immediate plans , but i 'm hopeful
i believe the original point of the exercise was to get grub installed properly onto the drive , which was
that may just be us feeling our way through how things work
upgrade step is written , just looking at a test
i would strongly advise against using a tarball
i 'm going off the information i have about the capability of the `` vsphere '' api that we 're
swap actually has to be formatted too .
are you sure your sftp client is using the correct ssh private key ?
read about mounting
hmm , how do i run it ? ( what 's the release to use ? 15.04 ? )
no it wo n't . you are not all users . stop trying to act like you speak for everyone
off topic .
you would likely use dm-crypt , with or without luks . luks will probably make things easier .
what 's the cpu/ram ?
yes , ones which have the little tux penguin beside them on steam 's website
hangout ?
the exact thing you should type is this : sudo apt-get install -f
or let 's say , is still in the queue
well , any desktop relies on a dm , so pick your choise or install ubuntu server and install xorg
can get an android buffer displayed on a drm device ... ?
^^ we can re-purpose our 1:1 for that
try unloading snd_hda_intel module ( if applicable ) and loading `` pcspkr '' module
is this for ubuntu-rs ?
it works , just need ip or local name ( if your router supports names for dhcp )
this is in another root..am having two root ..i cant access software centre in that only command line
it is , i was pinging for help with your gcc issue
yes , i am
ok , then what is easy to use that the normal ftp that came with ubuntu
they 're a couple of days old and there has been a bunch of stuff transitioned since then so i
you mean like a jail or chroot ?
the files are named after the short app id ( that is , without the version number )
add phonon ... the qt5 builds need -dphonon_build_phonon4qt5=on
yep , well , i had to download manually the packages , but installing things manually worked
in your case , `` ubuntu-bug linux ''
same here : ) i just use backintime to do it , since ( like deja-dup ) it does incremental
try just mount -o loop /dev/cdrom /mnt
oh , ok in fact i believed it might be . np , fixing that
allright . i am now having some other issues specific to my ppa package . but i should be able
99 little bugs in the code
yes
and ubuntu had it first : p
mdraid - 2 3tb drives - 1 raid for swap and 1 raid for the rest of the available space
`` after the it '' ?
`sudo apt-get purge mysql-server-core-5.6` then `sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client mysql-workbench`
k
does your mirror of the app work ?
not really , livecd-rootfs does what it should
odd , i only see cpu/process stuff , how do i display traffic ?
this happend in maas but not in aws
find out if pms writes its own log file ; any issues should be there
yep
well , ideally the version the phone is released on ? though targeting utopic is n't a bad idea ,
and , honestly , if i were a computer programming another computer , i 'd consider creativity a flaw ,
i can log in to default debian image
for hwe backports , i tend to verify that the origin exists in the archive before accepting the backport .
hey try the guest account
but it takes ages to download
would be good ot get that as a bug against the requisit charms
dunno . they didnt like my behavior . they thought i used enter as punctuaction .
am i missing some package in the chroot ?
perhaps the better answer is to define/mention those parameters
hehe
can you have a look at the buildbot failures soon to unblock landings ?
see the notes about sda3 here
no worry , sorry for ranting a bit rather than describing it well
i do have magical powers .
and then manually edited
im on vivid like i dont know , 2 months now ?
were you updating from 14.10 to 15.04 i mean ?
i 've that
thats what the smart guy suggests to tj- gluebi driver ( mainline )
my best guess is that something is modifying the contents/permissions of self.autotest_results_root after the chown call happens ; my code
nice , but this does not remove buttons from widnow decoration no ?
same here - it launched and worked for amd graphics accelerators from fglrx-updates
i 'm at the stage of considering you a troll as i do n't believe anyone can be this bad
yeah ... will approve/land it as soon as i get confirmation we 're switching to 1.3 for ota-7
oh , its changing things , but that does not include rain cycle so far
no , for that id i see 'test_status ' : 'failed ' , but 'result_payload ' : { }
ok , that could be useful later . do the 'chroot ' and we 'll check
i thought i noticed some lag.. im running a geforce 770m and i tried to play counter-strike 1.6 thru steam
can you tell britney to try the poppler transition with the gdal one ? it does n't seem to try
try sending a small test email with no attachments . see if that goes through .
0 to upgrade , 0 to install 1 reinstall 0 to remove and 3 not to upgrade
right ... not on-then-off . i meant turn the screen on and then go and remove the duplicate lines of
that service does not ring a bell with me ; i 'll defer to ogra_ or chipaca
silo 2 and silo 7 , but those seem to be a little bit troublesome so it might take some
nah
ah , ok , the test bot , but the merge bot wo n't work
just press tab.. you will get platora of options
i have to subscribe for this ?
or i just come to the debian hackfest , if cc will sponsor it ; )
( use a pastebin )
given that this operation involves removing a bunch of packages including ubuntu-desktop , i suspect you 're in a situation
excactly
what did you upgrade to ?
: (
that is probably going to be beyond me to fix , but `sudo apt-get update` to be sure your indexes
this ( version issues ) is one of the ( many ) problems you can run into when using software
sorry but it frustrates when people throw something out without looking at the information as if they have some kind
hmm , some ports it says have `` error starting server on 88 '' but nothing is showing on 88
do you have uefi ?
or its own file in its run directory ( for poorly configured things )
it would n't be silly
^^
i 'm on a dynamic ip
yeah definitely
i notived that the pastebin widget was also missing these days . was very useful
you mean like a blog post type thing ?
you can check hoogle for functions .
would it kill you guys to fix the plasma-desktop metapackage ? it was working fine before the update ... and
yea , storage is a feature flag in 1.24 though right ?
also if you need help just private message me , i 'll do my best to help
forwarded , and linked the lp bug
ya
you 're commenting out irrelevant stuff
^^
should we set a vote for the next meeting about the strategy document ?
i say it 's useful
it seems you forgot to push the release tag/commit for goget-ubuntu-touch
win7 right ?
let me take care of that in a min
anywayz , seems like you 've got momentum . best of luck to you .
update and upgrade then reboot
yes
probably not correct , then
depends on which installer option you 've chosen . 14.10 amd64 desktop iso ?
why ?
so that means that those files are available in the original tarball too
but can likely be started .
so subnet moving is an implicit part of space creation
then we 'll add www-data and you to it with `` sudo adduser < user > share ''
for the record you can get linux/ubuntu capable usb wifi on line , notated as such and cheap .
yep i do n't see any , there is only a keyboard button , which changes soft blocked as mentioned
does n't matter , appearance is at the topmost level , any distro can look like any other
yes
ummm i kinda learning as i go here ...
create a symlink `` sudo ln is /usr/lib/insserv/insserv /usr/sbin/insserv '' maybe ?
yeah , it detects the drive fine i assume ? ( you can pastebin dmesg and link me )
nomodeset relates to graphical mode settings of your video card . so it appears your latest problem was caused by
well i dont know ive never been in japan
framework for my `` to-fo '' page is going up
wipe the cache in ~/.cache/update-manager-core/meta-release
i also like to run autoremove and autoclean to keep my apt nice and tidy
then send him the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
cool
that page with the contact form that you filled in
yeah , i did n't think anyone in the community would complain about having extra time , but obviously it
let me look at what they want for the linux version , i guess there is a tag
i just used fdisk /dev/sdb , then 'd ' , then 'w ' . and removed the partition
call it `` kg 's store ''
always back your stuff up though
you are not making sense , stop and try doing that , if english is not you native language ,
no , does n't . fine , should n't , but if it is causing the installer to choke ,
if imports should n't be mixed then all components should have consistent versioning and be shipped/updated together and different versions
is n't your ntfs sda ?
yeah , and that sounds right
the driver ?
apart from your own scripts , the only system changes are the new systemd getty @ tty2 unit , /etc/rc.local
it could be confusing grub , yes . i 'll be interested in your experience with 15.10
have you flashed the phone with -- wipe ?
rtm-proposed
ok , press enter
yeah*
fyi the whole provider/* vs. storage/provider/* screwed me up for a long time
is there currently any suitable skin that looks neutral ?
and after that you can do `` grub-install /dev/sda '' and `` update-grub '' to be sure everything is in
thumper : i am questioning why it 's a ci blocker though . it fails far less often than the
no , those have server^ as a base
also , that 's why i linked to 'access ' , for the templates .
run `` apt-cache policy qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-contacts0.1 '' and `` apt-cache policy ``
`` django.db.utils.programmingerror : relation `` django_content_type '' already exists ''
well , you have more control over your work conditions . : )
and the 1.000.000 dollars problem : how ? *
so only the diff remains which is pretty useless
*blink*
kamoso 3.1.0 is in my xenial ppa , seems to be working : )
you dont need that installer
use initctl set-env -- global grid_unit_px=16
sure .
once you install the driver just restart and it should work
no , if there is snd_intel8x0
your upgrade is trashed
setting those without hacks seems hard at first glance
`` software updater '' that is
i did what you said and installed gdm , which does what i need it to do , but wth
: -d excellent !
ok , keep in mind that raid volume information will be persistent in your hard drives during installation . i
so no , that 's completely news to me
amd on linux ? interesting choice
i would use nmap and just can your network . - is this your homenetwork ?
grant all on wordpress . * to 'user ' @ 'localhost ' identified by `` password '' ;
i can do it
no
i try but no command found
it wont sync without account info
what kind of wifi chipset is the adapter using
what ? it worked for me . when is the last time you tried ?
nginx error logs , im requesting 404 files
bug 1422534
run # apt-get autoclean & & apt-get autoremove
i 'll fix that up right now
just a heads up about tomorrow and friday - approved
and since you are talking about important files , you already have one valid backup .
i do not need it in the main 15.04 ... overlay ppa is enough , as i am planning to
so , when i download a pic from the browser , and then i choose to open it in my
be sure to land it in each branch before moving on to the next branch
open a terminal and type it
i usually use dd for my usb stick iso stuff
i just allow to run these comands and not any command such as rm
click on the analog stereo oprton and click the test button at the bottom if there is one
i have a semi-janky install
you can then add further log commands after the commands that are supposed to work correctly , reporting their return
as sta7ic suggested though ... this just happened out of the blue ... i was poking postgres installs and configuring
that sounds like a very good idea
hmm , i 'm afraid my akonadi knowledge is rather limited . you could try # kde .
ssh server also hgives an sftp server you can connect to using nautilus and manage your files easily
copy it to your drive and extract it , tar -xjf file.tar.bz2
ack , so just about management
there is a bug report for elasticsearch
then you 're on call man
it has already been tested in several different environments so it is known to at least fix this bug ,
it 's not unity8 is it ?
but in ota6 it 's called notes
thx
ok
yeah i feel better today
will you run that retry command ?
context , swift ( and other packages , i 'm sure , but swift is where i noticed ) installs
but i was worried about existing snaps or sideloading
perhaps we should do the same thing they do ?
voidspace : we have : [ a dead container ] ; [ a host that 's just destroyed the container
cool ! i will attempt to install it
this is what i enjoy doing
hacking on a java project , listening to deep house music , and answering emails .
mark is canonical 's founder
but consider the arm64 tests , they take 18 hours
mh , i thought about that ... let me see
bummer , i 'm not real familiar with multisrceen setups , but the generic video driver in the live media
for some reason , the -dev was arch : any , it was just a bug .
it proves the shutdown job for systemd is as expected for vivid
reset to defaults and making new account didnt help
i have a feeling it might , but just a stab in the dark at the moment
thats true , but why it does n't show up on the v2..v3 diff ?
linux audio is definitely chaotic and a comprehnsive audio suite sure would be nice
i use netbootin
but maybe grub2 + liveboot will do the trick ?
you mean it started off useless and actually had something useful ?
those are configurable in `` ls '' ... .. it has a .rc file for that ... where you set
my unity8 problem or webbrowser problem ? : )
alright : ) . when would be a good day/time ?
but sure . but you can only do that while the user is actively using the app . and if
which card and which driver version ?
notifications , from gmail
related to masking mounted devices in particular
good . so what is happening here ? where does it say it is killing it .
actually , can you paste : system-image-cli -i
maybe : -p
another round of publicity for the q & a ? : )
get foundations to commit to bluez5 landing in vivid , or did they do that anyway ?
lol ... .
yes upgrade via terminal with do-release-upgrade , but one should update/upgrade and dist-upgrade before doing so
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
although the fact is , reinstalling the system it would have been faster
not even 777 apparently
bug report against xfce4-panel or ?
and did you start ubuntu media with the efi label ?
but that should n't be possible to do with the gui -- you can only select locales if you installed
add that findicu.cmake into it : )
you should somehow join to spotchat with that tab
add a `` really '' there : d
hp compaq nx 7300 laptop
what happened ? where was i wrong ?
why do u suggest arch ?
cherry picking the fixes for bug 1474606 is proving difficult because it depends the fixes for bug 1474195 ( which
i 'm waiting til the alpha 2 version of plasma 5/kf5 is released later this month around the 27th iirc
well , for now i 'll stick with nvidia-current . it installs nvidia-304 without issues . as i dont play
that is exactly why i run *nix , btw the company internal mail server is still a slackware 3.2 16m
there 's a separate low latency kernel ... okay
i agree .
dooferlad omw - ~3m
hm . i 'm on vivid . if you 're on anything older you 'd have an older qt
i was . couldn
he 's testing to try and grab some logs , so sit tight
heh ?
and you ca n't login via gui ?
it 's not an app being fussy ; it 's your graphics drivers .
yes , please
i know i just answered to a question i will stop that now
yeah sounds a good idea for all arm based platforms if you ask me .
in the combination above yes
i 've installed the 14.02 lts
what does the chrome task manager tell you ?
you drive a mercedes and you instantly understand why they command a premium price .
no
no
probably the dvd image is corrupt
^
especially since this error makes no sense
sure the limit is the sky
i have removed the dates from the main and from the gles.. i trigger a build now .
crd = coordinated release date . when all the distros and upstreams agree on the date and time to make
and of course , they told you it works with linux , but they do n't support it , right
no problem , glad i could be of assistance : )
look it up online for your model of router .
oh right , that 's strange indeed
ok but what about the dialog ? is my grub file replaced now or do i have the old one
well , please double check if you need a fresh fetch from upstream maas-spaces tip and rebase
they 're in their new location on the embarcadero , it 's beautiful
a guy fixxed his intel ssd on ide mode this morning , he mentioned your name
not commit , review
ok : )
looks like they user openvpn for their setup . iptables then
i am much more inclined to accept sth like this suggestion
agreed
it is kinda confusing
yeah , there 's tons of those lurking
yep !
hmm there 's not actually any useful information from that , can you try running `` nvidia-settings '' and look
whatever includes telnet is wrong by design .
i could be wrong but this likely fails
maybe there
i did n't . it was ntfs , the linux partition on it is ext4
google it
not to another `` machine '' , to another hdd if needed
please use an irc client that can notify you of pings : p
no it would not . that is another issue .
run systemctl as root
that pastebin url is bad again `` paste has been removed ''
luckily both meizu and bq can easily share the same kernel driver
should i install ?
i have n't tried anything yet , i just wanted to make sure to get the ball rolling on it
do you listen to bad voltage ? if you do n't - have a listen , the topic is discussed
so you want monodevelop version 3 for ubuntu ? for what ubuntu ?
yeah , especially on the holidays : )
forwards , or back ?
it is1.1
ah no period
current expectation for linux/os x is by end of q4 2015
does dekko have good automated test coverage ? that 's one criteria that the qa team look for before accepting
where is what stored ?
pnig
and what happened in dmesg after you tried it ?
no
would you mind opening a bug on this ( against 1.23 and up )
do n't we have to fix everything for it to be able to migrate , though ?
i know my recent changes added a few seconds to the cmd/jujud/agent test run ( on my machine at least
also , i believe once this is fixed we 'll be running into issues that it ca n't run xvfb
making all those branches be runtime decisions would slow down libc a whole lot .
so if that test was changed to ignore versions in -proposed , it would n't false positive like this ;
i did not say try a newer kernel
sure , will look this afternoon
good , the state/persistence story wo n't land
^
can adb in recovery but no more rom installed on device
bacon2d seems nice enough , but rather limiting . would be nice to get something like the quake engine running
nvm , i uploaded to vivid
google hangout is non-free , but still better than skype
you can always boot a live usb and reinstall grub to fix it
great
my employer want me here so i moved . by the way is there anything left in automation so that
black screen , no cursor . iirc .
why not ; )
do you have an external domain called `` captine.za.net '' ?
yeah , that was my concern
that 's how you do it the proper way
yes , i 'm pretty sure make install-dependencies will install mercurial , and 'go get github.com/juju/juju ' will get that
you 'll end up with a local copy of the page in a directory
the problem is that the raspberry pi 2 currently can not update : /
have a look . if there is a steam key you will have the linux version for free
that does n't mean anything
k look'n again now that i know . be right back .
i 'm going to investigate this without the silo
actually i installed a java based software in ubuntu . but unable to run it . java7 installed properly .
slangasek should be able to assign somebody
what errors did you experience ?
what issues are you having
why do you make me read cmake files ? : d
i was asking for help and looking myself for the past hour . you were automatically being rude assuming i
is it ok to skip providerid on maas ?
ok github.com/juju/errors 0.008s
; )
what is the problem ? i only came in on the end of that and it sounds like i may
is pavucontrol installed ?
i rebooted , no bootable media was found . i 'm now in a liveboot of ubuntu .
yes
openjdk 6 is available , oracle java 6 is gone
that 's what we just discussed
np , i 'm makin ' my way into `` bspwm '' : d good luck with xmonad : )
it currently calculates the value for each user at each startup .
anyway , the commit hash is the only thing that really matters
perhaps this is some evil plot from the kde devs to make this channel more popular ?
do you have a modified upgrade spec to deal with qg : ng ?
bzoltan_ : you guys would have to deal with this anyway with your next uitk landing , releasing the address-book-app
e-d-s has no template duplication and the same issue
remember to change the silo to xenial+vivid
i mean download & install of course ...
you propose to scroll the previewimagegallery ?
well i can fix this bug by just guarding the shell.qml call . but that seems like we 're leaving
before the ff , but they put it in blocked until i fix a bug
i 'm doing some final testbuilding before dropping things into my vivid test vm to see if the apport hooks
anything particularly fun ?
what distro is this ? perhaps you 've installed some kind of media scanner
yeah , ip changes tend to differe in the rest of the world though ; ) here they are on
google it .
hp notebook . clear kubuntu 15 installation were painless and everything worked like a charm and then i decided to
of course
tell everyone what operating system you have .
also try the guys from # upstart , they also might know
no
okay than what is the ubuntu release ?
well , spanish has ~2.5 times the number of native speakers than hindi
actually , unity is a fixed desktop . the layout is locked since the beginning .
not everyone wants a web server running php
cancel , then
so it does n't look like there 's any way to stop it being kill 'd .
we have new machines anc clean containers .
i just updated to r163 and then opened the system settings app to test shell rotation on my n4 .
quick idea : get a different sd card
did you change the option during the session ?
i 'll just reopen that bug and we 'll take a look then if that 's exactly what you 're
yes
canonical way means ?
double clikc that
i still use ubuntu and puppy linux at work on occasion on usb sticks just to test hardware out when
i can restart now if desired
( wlan0 ) : deactivating device ( reason 'none ' ) [ 0 ]
no , we can not get logs for maas because they have unresolvable dns
use something like htop to see what it is
ok
like the factoid says , support questions here or chat in # ubuntu-offtopic : )
type dpkg -l | grep `` nvidia\|nouveau '' | & curl -f `` sprunge= < - '' sprunge.us
we have a blocking bug that looks like it involves some of menn0 's code
what did you run , 'make html ' ?
ubuntu v 14.04
you can try it on another wifi at another location
do i need a re-boot ?
and if i proposed a mp to make payui bahave like a normal app , would you consider it ?
ok
sorry , but in the moment , my rpi 's can do more than the ubuntu-phone : (
get the bigger one
hello , still working on upstream on the issue
telnet { ip } { port }
yes
re git sync.. its a bit of a dance to get a working copy.. you have to stitch them together
do you have a working eid card reader on ubuntu ?
it might not boot ubuntu anymore so use the live usb to get back here
local only yea ?
the universe is telling you to eod
one more work intensive way is to include the updated mono in your repo , but that would be a
i know mate.. but if you check the log which i pasted , you 'll understand me.. : \
np
open
note : i 've never installed to a multi hdd system like your but ... yeah
did you switch to systemd ?
ok , type sudo apt-get install pastebinit
cp : can not stat 'config/hooks/03-boot_with_systemd.chroot ' : no such file or directory
this ongoing uitk landing has the listitem ... what is now blocked by the clock app : d : d
gkrellm or conky would do that then
i will quit ~we-love-pitti for two days before i rejoin .
mwc
i have n't looked into it too hard
time extended/
no one really knows
were you able to solve it , or just quit using gpu support altogether ?
checking manually that too
sorry - generate-image
ipmi might be able to indicate better what happened ?
but didnt work
it 's not just going to fail on arm64
none of them look like show stoppers
if you cant get answer come back an re-ask here mate
also , if you could do gdbus call -y -d com.canonical.systemimage -o /service -m com.canonical.systemimage.info : )
what error do you get with the import ?
since the leases are stored in mongo , and the lease server is running on the state server , i
no way to edit the grub config file ( s ) and add the kernel parameters ?
so it was automatic to you , i was still looking after : p
go to arch so
sorry for not answering your question about 0.6 earlier -- i did n't get on until about 15 minutes ago
: )
not all literally , every one of the packages you found
what you are typing exists in the subsection below
i suspect the failure might be due to the bug in traceback about exception header lines
though it feels like i 'm writing c code now xd
into a webpage form . but that 's just an example -- think of all the things that are ux
man mkfs
ack , was just reviewing davecheney 's one
i 'm just inept at manipulating iso tracker testcases , so was suggesting that a qa type ( *cough* )
not the latest ...
also doing bug fixing behind-the-scenes
lol , many users are fan of rufus everywhere
you mean the bios settings ?
it gets all the data it can get without damaging the drive first , then it goes back and tries
sudo apt-get install virtualbox
and family ? where do you live ? i 'm in weltevredenpark . 2 boys , 4years and 2 months
cory_fu , marcoceppi : locust for example only supports python2.7
it = thumbnailer fix
nice !
what version of kubuntu are you using ?
ahhh ok sir
oh , need a new mp ?
haha , yeah , i can understand
note that is universe . ppas do n't count
did , got prompt - bash-4.3 #
any of them already installed ?
this team should be helping youth to contribute into ubuntu and foss and as i said it has been very
argh !
grub-install also ensure all the grub modules are in /boot/grub/ $ { arch } - $ { fw_type } /
something has gone wrong then : - )
i dont even know how to do this : d i have no clue , how to @ linux
if you like pulp fiction , its a must see
i didnt like unity when it came out but decided to give it a few weeks try out and once
nothing will ever satisfy me .
you do n't have any of those in your auth.log ?
as opposed to a proper dpkg build , which does it all as $ user , except for the deb-building
plus , you can reproduce the bug , i was just testing that the kernel was n't obviously broken .
# freenode would be better for irc client support
yes
oh dude seriously put some clothes on no one needs to see that . /me buys some more mind bleach
until 15.04 yes ... after you have to test it
wait 1
i know we 've had similar problems in the click scpoe , where we use qtnetwork , but i do
so wine can not help you run a 64bit binary on a 32bit system .
and does your system meet the requirements mentioned ?
based on ubuntu is not the same as ubuntu
ensure it 's valid swap ( else : make it so , mkswap ) , read log messages ( dmesg
ok , now opem a terminal and type alsamixer , navugate with the arrow keys and make sure automute is
this howerver , now ( but not before ) , started to cause issues with apt
did you push somewhere the code of the contenthub demo app you talked about during last meeting ? : -
are you that you do n't have any graphic card ? : o
speaking of which , is it just me or does krillin not ring on telegram messages , while mako and
the dreaded wait
forecast said snow , but now does n't
ah , or that
how ? if they were installed with this package , so they are as new to the system as new
ah , as root
yes , you need root
well , i 'm gon na do another declarative upload with fixed symbols for s390x , which will trigger builds
and then use their web console to point the domain at your ip , by adding a dns a record
i 'm not a bzr admin on pypi
is this in a vm ?
oh ? good . right , so what 's the deps in the pc file ?
do you have an idea what the cause is here ? i do n't understand why it ca n't delete
also having the manual on lp lets users download the whole thing for offline use
it 's a pretty straight forward setup , we use it all the time ( maas with vms ) ,
play with it with `` apt-cache search -n ... . ``
yeah , it 's odd
at some point te block device has to be presented decrypted ; back that up
i imagine that new users may not realize this though and often times they might try to follow instructions in
how would i know ?
sorry for the distraction
balloons dholbach which ml would this go to ?
you 're having an issue with the wireless adapter and the graphics system ?
just the log is wrong
apt has a wget ; )
idk , with this driver at least , under linux . not in windows . so i guess : )
are 2001:67c:1360:8c01 : :18 2001:67c:1360:8c01 : :19 some kind of special v4- > v6 things ?
is there an error code at the bottom-left corner of the screen ?
i would reccomend 14.04.2 yes , then updates on not upgrade to 14.10
mount : mount point /mnt/boot/efi does not exist
you wo n't need execute bit on data files - you really should not have that
yes ideally the backlog would let everyone know at a glance what we are doing ; including the rest of
you do n't really need a list of the past transfers though do you ? just list the files in
looking
i was going to suggest a mocked s-i , but whatever 's fine with me .
since when ?
init-repo < = initialise a shared repository
can you please add a card for the application custom proxy object , and put an estimate on it .
right ; transitive deps , etc .
asia , india
and did you ?
btw . are there any integration things you 'd need discussing in the meeting today ?
well we do have -dbg packages in ubuntu , i do n't think that hurts ? so far i 've
feel like fixing that to actually be accurate before i upload this ?
uefi is a new firmware like bios
do you have aenough for a bug for that ?
unless it 's also a touch display ... but meh
context is a wonderful thing or it does look a tad odd in here : p )
whats up ?
hmm , but rvm group is shown on all outputs ?
yes , let 's add a spaces ( ) method , taking no arguments for now ( until we need
do n't stress about it
thats not the output of the command
try remove what ? the # before grub_hidden_timeout ? or the grub_timeout=10 ?
then you can use `` tmux attach '' later on to re-attach that shell
perhaps not ?
that will give you comparable results actually .
uhh maybe 13
: ) ok , i 'll do that now
if you want reliable mate , choose lts
and has had very extensive workouts over a long period , and is one of several alternative macs in the
merci
install a supported version
that 's a shame , because i 'm first hand familiar with seagate tools and they 're useless in this
was that app dump what you needed ?
they love it in # # networking
that is not an issue
so postfix is the default in ubuntu ,
there are several faq answers for network scanning on windows and mac , but no clues with regard to linux
i also think its animated
yep
this is hardest thing i 've ever had to do in linux @ _ @
but it launches on the phone
no other operating system exists
i 'm going to try to re-install gnome-network-manager and boot unity and see what 's going on with that ;
i get that that 's a problem , but it is a wrong problem . the rules for binary ucs
^ ?
strange , i 'm pretty sure i did dd on the entire device not just a specific number of the
`` sdk '' , basically
ok , and which is the issue ?
two chips
hope you get over the cold !
i can chroot haha , i just dont know how to install ubuntu using the command line
great . please pastebin the output of `` cat /boot/grub/custom.cfg '' .
no idea what you mean
turns out that pressing the checkbox breaks the selectedindices somehow
it keeps failing to go to recovery even if i flash it
fun : )
none when i double click it or right click and run
freez
yeah , but we get counter failover which makes mvo happy ; - )
which ubuntu version ?
ok , let 's do this via a chroot ( change root ) to do it properly
on the old board i had a card for the sanity and osk .
tryed another driver from your additional drivers list ?
ok , just a moment
i am no expert at all ... just wondering
yes sir
well did you see it auto mounted yet or no ? from `` mount ''
outside of this video i 've not seen much ...
ok , run 'dpkg -l|grep tcpdump|awk ' { print $ 2 } '|xargs sudo apt-get purge '
you should still check it since it can happen again
i would have accepted man byobu from you but `` carefully '' ?
do other people still use the forums even ?
sounds good , far better than what i would have done
we do not have a confirmation however that someone actually used the new builds succesfully
because policy there is `` no unsolicited messages '' , and dbus-1 does n't track messages if no-reply-expected is given
sheesh , that 's kind of messed up .
do you have a ubuntu related question ?
mainline is your best bet for least breaking of everything
a function name to extract ? can you give a concrete example ?
interesting - did n't realise that
yes and firefox for example
would n't take much of a slip at the keyboard to accidentally delete an entire heirachy , since you have
what is nvidia-prime ?
is that by design or a mistake ?
ctrl+alt+t
i try to keep the patches to a minimum
yes and no , certainly for a location header it should error as a malformed url
though the bootstrap failed , the mongod is still up . is there anything you want me to do to
sandybridge ? mmm , is it 4k ?
mir 0.17 will be for x-series ?
i can not boot
tell that to dschatz_ in -server
can i like.. disable acpi in bios or something like that ?
it 's good that you can keep away from it , i have to use it because of addiction to
talk to pitti who ran away from a train station .
the 12/30 iso ?
ya . and a looooong drive
then i misunderstood you , i apologize
i knew what you 'd want , so i went ahead and did it
so once i have a working sources.list , i could then run a dist-upgrade , right ?
desrt , get a room
no kidding , lesson well learned
you are not looking at all relevant fields in the user table .
gotcha . my wife has a convertible ( thinkpad x220 ) where she only uses the touchscreen for drawing and
nothing ( literally ) . qemu and adt-run were using 0 % cpu and output was sitting at that line
yep
morning : )
but maybe vagrant lets you name interfaces something more standard : - )
yep .
well it did
popey can : - )
i 'd suspect you 're getting notifications due to 99update-notifier
ok , i 'll be on standby
try sudo apt-get -f install
yes -- i have no idea what happened -- been using ubuntu for ~10 years now ... never really had
that 'd be funny , is a tragic sort of way .
let it run for a minute or two
^^
lets try to separate out the copying of results somewhere from the running of the tests .
i use it too
it packages a customised os x into an unbooted disk image
i prefer experienced advice : d i have used rhythmbox but it was buggy and looked too old school
ali1234 , elfy : indicator-sound 's volume scale is broken , likely because of gtk3.14 . i 've already informed
i wish
ideally , that 's what it normally would do ... and i did download it from the official repositories .
after it 's done , try nvidia-settings , it might show some useful options
here we do not really answer your first question , we want what you actual problem is is all .
alright , mail going out .

uefi looks on boot media for a script to run , rather like ms-dos used to look for autoexec.bat .

we are close to finish our first goal for the test suite . then , focus will be on running
yes , if you have `` objects '' on the desktop - they will stay until they are not on
ah , ok. will look at it this morning
what was the typo ?
well , i was trying to get it to go from 14.04.1 to whatever 14.04.x is , the newest one
try command | stdbuf -o0 grep
you may also need a new launchpadlib .
ulock widgets , rightclick on menu icon and pick alternatives
whoo , that is some windows thing ...
print ( getattr ( _topics [ module_name ] , '__doc__ ' ) )
no . there are no missing answers . there are only answers you dont like .
also the url in your email for the bugs does n't work
do n't worry - fixed it ! i needed to install the package `` qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-syncmonitor0.1 ''
pastebinit you mean ?
and are there any conf files in there that are in there .
try double negative
well , if you use the latest u-d-f from wily at least
how can that happen in dependencies are specified correctly ? i.e it does n't just say i need any version
not san . just home storage server . inside a lan .
remember that if drives from the same batch fail they 'll often fail around the same time
is has a .pc package ?
well , .iceau.. and .dbus should be owned by user user too and might be the issue here
good night
ha ha
ota-5 maybe at the end of next week , if manufacturer qa goes well ? or later ?
well yes , i have no plan what to do now : \
great , because fwk and oem ca n't be forked
maybe with raspbian ( debian )
yeah confirmed locally and via api docs that spn is required
nothing useful i can see , complaining about loading the battery 100 charged icon , but i doubt it 's
i do n't want speed . i want freeram only
ok . so my card must be unsupported with ubuntu in that case .
and those nucs will be fine with my existing pdu
mmike : you definitely should be able to kill machine 0 and have your environment still work fine .
it didnt let me install to /opt without beeing sudo
sure but there 's lots of different things to do . are you an upstream developer wanting to test changes
ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php
type sudo parted -l | nc termbin.com 9999 and paste here
yeah , that 's my thinking too

you like drake ? lmfao ?
check the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory ?
what 's happening for you ?

after that was successful ( or its even installed ) do `` sudo ppa-purge ppa : oibaf/graphics-drivers ''
the biggest security issue is the user installing unsecure stuff or making changes .
nik90 suggested we can use qtorganizer insted of alarm
pretty sure he just uploaded it as is

ok all is nice and clean now - redeploying the modified bundle with machines constraints specified..
why ?

yes ! : )
well , i 'm the wrong person to ask about that
weird error indeed
that 's great : )
done
granted my ppa does have it , but that 's based off the debian pacakge anyways : p
what it means ?
or use 'lspci ' -n ' to find the pci id of the wireless and look it up in the

same for mediaplayer ?
when you say 'copying the right files ' - which do you have handy if not an iso ?

re : places
so you mean the convergance as productive enviroment ?
should i just use a cronjob instead of what we did ? it seems the cron job works the same
i 'll have to check it out
no , focus on your problem ,
ram , gpu , and psu would be the first ones to inspect imo
basically i do n't touch visible so it is always true . it is the property inherited from qquickitem and

its a i7 cpu in a toshiba laptop . so that might be the reason for the fan to spin
i used ch6 , then i suspected that could be a problem and switched to auto , 1 , and
maybe sinzui can answer
maybe a permissions issue , i dunno sorry
oh you did n't get qa approval ? bad ! bad veebers !
oh he has n't even gotten that part going ? nevermind then : )
i will not buy more ram if i have infinite ramdisks here .
but that 's quite a different role than the environment name has traditionally played in juju
got an example of a property ?
no worries : )
its possible to get only the result of wlan0 ?
that is how : /nick newnick
yeah i recall the counter-argument , i guess i never saw it get resolved
going to flash it , no worries . will probably end up tearing it down and just borrowing some hardware
btw , how hard would it be to patch clog ?
let 's wait for the importer to stop running

no clue what the problem may be based on your description
if you 're wanting to test deployment on openstack , i 'd get creds to our bootstack and use the

on unity ?
so that 's the reason the repositories are deleted ?

you 're probably right
perfect much appreciated
hopefully you dont .
if you check /var/log/syslog , you can grep on pptp
i 'm not quite sure i follow the mp , what 's the reason for adding an extra translateme function
as a fellow java developer , i would be willing to help you with any questions you might have .
why are you using the live usb ? do you even have linux installed ?
# playonlinux + forums ?
me too
use the update manager for upgrading
sil2100 : ofcourse i blame saviq for all of this : )
ask in # ubuntu please
no . it 's a desktop .
thinking about the possibility of a name collison on `` env-uuid ''
sounds like we can run the full os in the emulator !

i ca n't tell you how much fun i have : )
good point about ipnet.string ( ) - i can parse the cidr , then replace the ip part

there is the partner repo for software not allowed to be shipped in regular repos .

you 're the odd one out again
i 'm pondering that question . doing the switch at .2 hurts a lot , so doing .0 with metapackages
i was exclusively talking to sudormrf : p
iirc he should be back for a week next week
oh , good . would be a good time to catchup , when do you guys have the next sprint
i would start there if it were me , it is a specific app just for this .
we do go to conferences . not many , but targetted , dpm was at one this week doing exactly
it 's `` om nom nom '' , not `` nom nom ''

right , but i did the dd thing when using cmp

not just one thing
and a lot of that never happened ...

yeah , failed the next day
i believe it was if i remember correctly , but my memory is hazy on this
i am so sorry , but you are ignorant ...
i havent installed windows . i have nothing to do with windows

how would i go about that ?
you mean like a peasant ? : )

axw saw the same behaviour on his environment ( i did too )
i like having you in this timezone
what are you expecting from plug/unplug phones ?
which snapcraft are you using ?
there are no devices to disconnect/forget .
they are there just to be discovered

a specific dbus interface as we did for mtk
you could symlink your config folders to a dedicated space on your ssd .
no worries , just came back from a conference , so i had to do a lot of catch up

maybe you should test and see if it works ?
try disabling it.. if they company wants to faciliate `` ubuntu friendly '' they can.. if not , try setting
looks cool , will try .
no difference
get my `` dash has it 's own ... '' comment ?
okay , so i will just remove the `` name=master-db:3 '' part and hope that works

well , if i write the patch ( which will be ubuntu delta ) , will you have any objections
what does `` blkid /dev/pv1/lv1 '' report ?
infinity has an interesting theory about signed/unsigned ints and timestamps being negative and all : )
hmm ? what 's a first ?
a compatibility question is offtopic ?
tried minitube ?
is that directed at me ? do n't have a nexus 6 , do n't plan to ever buy one
who knows . 2am now though so i 'm afraid it 's beyond my time to consider looking into it
i would n't expect them to be much different .
you and i were on the last one , so most probably mhall119 and dholbach/balloons depending on snappy open house
can you point ircuser in the right direction
you are now logged into the system on tty1 ? run ' dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia | pastebinit

if you 're not having problems , it 's best to leave things be if you do n't know what

i can get into the server in recovery mode
there should be a gui package manager frontend , but it 's not software center
you think apache is so much slower than on kubuntu 14.x ?
not random , but yeah .
starting some at 1 would require special casing them all in the test
yes dvd
this returns nothing
will look at dandrader 's issue with the unity-notifications plugin
so how do i get the 3.15 version ?
do an ipv6 traceroute
_we_ do ?
at least having them marked as such will simplify changing them to separate types if needed imo
separate log files would be tricker to manage when envs are destroyed
np : )
actually before save it is 16 ( friday ) and after save it is 128 ( auto-detect ) . so
so when are you getting the error ? ( what command are you running ? )
fyi , i also did submittodebian on the autopkgtests and i 'm discussing that with debian
the thing with the closest name i can find in the repository is ripperx , and that 's for audio
sure
how to check in bios
you never replied to my question
with what ?
anyhow , bad merges notwithstanding , we should n't drop the configure bit . i 'll ( re- ) forward
yeah
then give it a try if you want .
.
oddly enough it had no affect on either browser
huh ? there should be 400gb . hmm .
what you basically asked is `` how can i audit everything going on with my server ''
synps/2 synaptics touchpad
yes , , , something like that
yeah , booting now , not got to that yet
/etc/lightdm or /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d
i just think that it is either nvidia or intel as the graphics unit . not both can be active

`` address- < space > - < value > '' might address my concerns but i 'm still a bit
you have to change the server to spotchat and then /join # linuxmint-help
what is disk creator ?
shrinking just makes some unallocated space available , so you can use it with linux
i 'm seeing a lot of `` fails password for root from -- -ip -- - ''
that 's a good idea
controlmaster
that sounds really time consuming but no i just wanted to shred sensitive files before i reformat hard drive .
app author 's choice : - )
sure , against lp : webbrowser-app ?
can you pastebin dmesg ?
tbh , building debug packages in the packaging code comes with its own set of problems
yes . just telling synaptic to 'reinstall ' seems to have solved it . i 'm going to chaulk it
the command is `` gnome-session-properties ''
yes that 's fine
@ useraccounts
they are running headless
silo 20
i suppose we could use a separate facade ...
in the maas web ui , can you see a machine allocated after running the insaller ?
yes , that was what i was on about earlier . the live env kernel looks like 14.10
ask a question first
gives error while self test
and more importantly for you , they have n't released the tools to unlock it
oh , hmm , maybe fglrx is failing to create its default x config
sha1sum /usr/lib/initramfs-tools/bin/busybox
figure out the costs and send us the proposal
\o/
ah , right . i also made you member of the website team
regarding the q & a session or in general ?
the proposed answer may not work , but is worth a try .
maybe a question for # ubuntu-touch ?
this is also outdated in the wiki : `` add ppa : canonical-qt5-edgers/qt5-proper and ppa : phablet-team ''
reconfig done , so run build for uoa-integration-tests
not that i 've seen
then it is likely plasmashell , open a terminal kill plasmashell and restart it with 'nohup plasmashell & ' .
i just installed xchat , and as i was explaining about gedit , when i use `` alt + x
so that seems to suggest that gunicorn is started as a service by the init daemon

where does pull-ppa-source come from , i do n't seem to have it and i ca n't find where it
can you try in private nav ?
the .1 and .2 are just package updates , so when you do a fresh install without internet access ,
eric was installing snappy on qemu the other day
yeah , no plans for vivid this week , so +1
drop the -h and use sort -u
yep , but you posted another sources.list that made me wonder ...
no problem ; )
not directly
ok
yeah , i do n't care that much about the precise name
how are you determining there is no swap ?
is the orientationsensor in the app ?
was it not europe/berlin before ? ; )
yes , we build devel-proposed images from wily + overlay
this people are playing politics

happy2help !
i actually hate all of that audio/video stuff , but did do `` binnmus '' and patches to get them
thats what im asking
snapcraft , or snappy ?
celeron ; what de are you running ? have you considered a lighter environment ?
first , what is the *correct* package name ? kdump-tools does not exist
no
possibly specific to uefi boot

you can choose to delete all other copies but keep the first . fdupes -d -n dirname

are you using a usb 3.0 flash ? some say that 2.0 works when 3.0 fails
ok
i thought that 's what you 'd find ! i did something very similar with a swap partition yesterday ...
debian and ubuntu and some centos
and i say it 's not missing much to wrap the rest of what slangasek was doing
for a more stable experience try lts mate
earlier you wrote : `` df -i shows /usr is 100 % ''
do you have a fuller log of the build failing and particularly all of the output of the apt bits
editor or visual , are two of the places , but i do n't have them in env or set
is_sim_inserted will be true if a sim is inserted in any slot
an amd bobcat , asus k53u-a53u . i know it takes time , but with the devel it works ,
awesome !
does serenia.ovh resolve ?
whats behind driver=
because ubuntu-desktop is the default thing that a `` full desktop '' 'should ' have .
which is even worse than the dda issue we had when we disabled parts of the greeter on the desktop
it includes perrito666 's backport
well , the pol devs will tell you that there are a lot of diefferences .
just murder me
not that i know of
your first command should 've been `` sudo apt-get clean ''
imgur ?
mtpaint is very simple but good
that 's fine , check the link i posted and see if it makes some sense or not
i am trying/have tried to run the normal ubuntu installation - from the ubuntu site
i could also move it away , create a new one , and you re-push ?
its here to play a couple source games till i can buy a r9 290
no , i 'm just questioning your path to consistency : p
it 's an intel driver . it was proving to have some issues as it was
right
i feel sorry for your tastebuds
nope
if you have genuine windows 7 , and not extend the off-topic here too much , you *should* have gotten
delete the partition table on the usb and then create new . be sure you are messing with the right
np . remember you can type a filter in system settings window to narrow down what you are after if
i 'd say you get to take up that bug with the people whose binary driver you 're using .
fyi you did n't actually *ask* that question , and you 're comparing apples and oranges
i mean when you first put the nvidia driver on ?
the gpt tools can write an mbr . either protective ( it has a single partition that covers the entire
well , we can copy it for now
this conversation is coming back to me now .
note the # 111111 is the hex colour ; ) so that would be a very dark grey
maybe we need another category for app reviews , maybe `` notification '' or something , which allow the app
^
alright.. am guessing you do not have a root password.. yeah
that 's strange it appears searches with `` charm '' in them do n't work . very strange
also , is there any harm in doing these builds ( with minor modifications for debugging ) ?
oh and of course i have lightdm
type my name
yes it does
beleve me , i tried 3 times , and you are wrong !
sorry i forgot to mention that i use xubuntu
ahhhhh
ohh yeah ... then it 's def . not mounted .
not anymore . i do n't have more privileges that you now .
fix broken packages from recoverymode ?
if the original /home/ was on /dev/sda9 that explains how you lost it , and the encrypted files
no , i want an explanation of the changes , is that so much to ask for for an sru
because i expect it to return an error in the future and i 'd rather not deal with adding all
they can let me trace the mail transport id ?
using local ip
o/
that list is sorted by the kernel version naming , with ( generally ) the latest kernel version listed first
and the problem is ?
so maybe i should switch back
did n't we think of an alternative name for `` styleset '' ?
you are spamming the channel with drivvel , please stop
it 's certainly possible to develop it , but doing so is going to require a deep amount of hacking
you mean like the lenovo superfish root kit ?
it 's uefi , not bios : )
and you could do the same with a specific revision i assume ?
try without ?
from memory there 's a bool constant
put the stuff in ~/.vimrc
agree discuss near future events at march meeting
i would try xda forums in the device section for that device . there might be a few who already
i guess i have to disable secure boot
weird . why do i not see libxmir.so linking to gl-anything ?
magic
i just did what you said , and it made the dest directory on the remote machine
11.2.202 is the latest
you want of=/dev/sdx
i 've no idea what that is except kmail , which im not even running
ya i was trying to tell you that i am going to install an antivirus for shure
it should then detect the file and update the db .
i 've made progress
i 'd recommend asking for the link to what ever *buntu use on their channel .
yes i 'm logged in as the user now
but . but . opaqueness !
thats what , as states `` is no longer needed '' .. or considered so..
hah , the api call worked and i bet it 's now going to fail on contacting keyserver.ubuntu.com
: - ) kk one sec
you could try gparted
sure , we can tell them that too
i assume if pulseaudio is capable of that and the relevant ports are open then it should be doable .
which probably also means missing tests : -/
we are beefing up support for that , that much i know , but if there are any special measures
for wily , just for tooltips . too late for bigger chances
according to his bug report ( and here ) , the `` additional drivers '' control panel works fine .
that 's quite possible
i have n't specified a filesystem , just an exports file .
: )
yes i subscribed
you coudl test till then with memory manager
like /cdrom/dists/vivid/main/binary-amd64/packages.gz ?
i 've been down this road before when i was repairing digital cable converters , everything would finally work and
silo approved
not as convenient but at least all you qi chargers do n't go to waste
i do n't think if anyone is working on it that we would have a fix ( or having a
haha yeah , learning that the hard way . but any idea how i can re-install then ?
yes , we can just import latest from debian
works great !
it is active
: - ( what is so different between v2 and v1 ?
i wish you a quick recovery in any case
yeah , that would work .
and what package is it ?
yes , i 've been on other projects . now filling in for dave for a week or so .
then sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
now let me reboot and see if its causing problems becuase first 23gb is free : p
how about as the requester ? can gimp use content-hub to get images to edit ?
yup , does n't look good with all the prefails etc
how do i nuke it ?
`` 12:39 < laney > mardy : what about removing the packages '' from that lo
do we need design to work on that ? ca n't that just be hacked in whatever way you find
that 's mdadm , not dmraid
nope , kernel as well
is 14.10 considered bleeding edge ? or would that be 15.04 ?
ack . i do n't really expect it to happen either .
hey so , you guys did n't deploy the new community page today ?
because utouch doesnt have controls
i don t understand
oh , so you did .
they 're generally not looking prettier : -/
ok
yeah , sounded like fun !
pretty much just : )
what did you change recently to break the wireless ?
it does not detect the card
try `` groups nxlog ''
and yeah duplicates should be respected
i see : )
the actual fix was only a few lines though
in that case , nevermind .
i. e. is this a generator you are working on ? they should n't call a lot of externals if
type /join # mirc and ask there mate
ok , so upstream preferred for cross-distro stuff ; how about for debianised patches , preference debian , and then
ftp is old and bad and not good and terrible . you should use sftp
i 'm from about 5 years back , missed a lot of things since then
if you install it to the efi system partition as `` \efi\boot\bootx64.efi '' that 's the 'simple boot path '
or # # linux even
: (
did you download the iso ?
you mean like tab-key navigation ?
care to try and help bassem ? the usb booted in uefi mode but shows flashing cursor in legacy/bios mode
right
do you happen to know what the plans wrt google photos are now that they shut down the g+ service
woot ?
how can i install them ?
i hope ... . what do you suggest if i wanted to buy another in the future ? i will
i dont have additional drivers to my knowledge , i only installed the firmware ! nothing else !
but then you can also have the import qtquick.window 2.2 : )
yeah ... exhausting
happyaron , sorry but the zfs news review is not going to be for today from me , we have
you meant ssh login right ? or the normal local user-account login ?
it is similar . as i understand it works for .net based programs , specifically .net 3 and under but
no , it was fresh
about subnets ( )
for vb.net ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! !
divbyz0 ok working
really , ca n't say for free there is anything better .
confirmed the file rename on my bq rtm rw btw
it 's a usb wifi ?
will systemd undo/change any of our changes ?
have you rebooted since the change ?
nothing
no tests in this , no ?
hm , what do you add then if there 's no diff ?
about twice a month . but when i do it 's very important
hmm , or rather ; can you assign that new silo , and we 'll do a rebuild on the
ok then install java as i told you earlier
yes , it ' intended for vim
right , you should have vsync options that probably are automatic now
so you ask for help with that
i use my aging t410 for everything now
because the moment i click on it , that 's when the issue appears all over again .
first question is `` how did you install skype ''
huh ?
tried that already , -- series is ignored
but that would break the other package though ?
# c++
[ ubuntu/vivid-proposed ] kubuntu-notification-helper 15.04ubuntu4 ( waiting for approval )
unlikely
can probably survive without for now : )
let me know if there is anything i might be able to do with your branch , i may have
yeah , i got ta stop doing thing
because those 'forks ' in the blockchain affect everything
it does
right , so ubuntu policy all good and we have good people to keep that in place . but canonical
scarlett seems to do backports readily , she just happens to be away this week
i just see black page now
right on it in a second then
we can but hope so
should work
yeah kinda sucks
pastebin the output of `` lspci ; lsusb ''
we use cpm with aws
operation successful , i have returned from the dead : d
but there 's nothing we can do about that now . blocking the promotion wo n't achieve anything
also , if this is a hassle , make a separate /home partition so that this is always easier in
i ca n't make any sense of that statement . a picture would be better
yep : )
try javac and the programs you need
`` game of the week '' appears untranslated .
great ! 14 what ? should be either .04 , .04.0x , or 10
as activefocus does n't help there
`` sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | pastebinit '' then paste the resulting link here .
suggest you install plasma 5.3 , it 's available for kubuntu 15.04 in a ppa
do n't worry . it 's just the first time i 've been assigned to a landing , so i
sounds great
it might not write though . create an fs and try copying files to it . then make sure the
it does , but be careful
agreed
not everyone is used to command line
but i 'm clearing it up anyway
pygmentize -g
if that was your end goal , you should just install from lubuntu iso though
please do n't ask to ask a question , simply ask the question ( all on one line and in
using skype at the moment , i 'll try a reboot soon , though
we 'll see what kind of api we can provide at this level
ok , manual insert it is
done
/usr/sbin/grub-setup : error : hd0 appears to contain a xfs filesystem which is n't known to reserve space for dos-style

i did myt best to express myself
i have a few important files on this.. 'll copy it to my hd..
looking @ google earth 's docs , they say it needs the 32bit package and multiarch
not too bad , a little slow in the bootup , but otherwise workig well for a dev os
very useful . although the search is only effective if you updatedb . the search is in a database of
that 's up to autopktesting , but it 'll migrate the way it usually does , nothing special is blocking
but i have n't *stopped* complaining about lack of hud yet
i do n't see why this would stop you from using ubuntu ?
not being able to complete tasks in the given time does n't count against you does it ?
add me
module `` unity.test '' is not installed
is it only the client that might not have one ?
i can provide mentor-level help
dunno , but i 'd install mariadb-server instead
10.04 desktop is even more dead , you 're using an end of life distro version - we ca n't
on ubuntu-core-launcher , yes
there was output one time , but now nothing
do you have any ppas added ?
i any pattern to search with..
i 'd call it a case of one set of developers wearing blind-folds and not fixing issues their code creates
so , the output of `` reverse-depends -b src : libqtdbusmock '' is rather short .
creating it in the unprivileged part of the launcher , that is
screen tearing
i 've tried to patch click and add that package to click/chroot.py , but when i create the chroot ,
no problem , those were quick-fixes , i checked that those are actually 'fixed ' in the landing itself
my ubuntu partitions are at the end of the drive , no dual boot issues with performance here
how to find that
/etc/default/grub
yeah
yes
there are raid controllers that are on the mobo . so `` chips on the mobo '' does not mean
all you do now is switch between r71 and r72 and observe the difference in behaviour .
right.. so , there will be a proprietary driver.. `` legacy '' one.. ideally . look in the gui for
when you move repos . adjust their vcs fields please
wrt progress bars , i was kidding about gxui ( it 's too green yet ) . that program ,
there is no `` driver : `` listed .
sorry , was talking to ame
i suspect you 'll find it does n't work if you install those other packages from the release pocket only
ok , so not being unlocked during intialramfs then
yours is because synaptic is asking apt to read/write from an area that the _apt user ca n't access .
cool , reading / remembering . there where a few cases we found where the same upgrade step had to
there are 1000 's who reflash their ubuntu-touch devices back to android 5.0 , have you ever seen that ?
it depends on when the sleep occurs . it could be before the root fs is mounted r/w
could you please answer your pv ?
wich driver did ubuntu choose by default ?
it all sounds so easy when you say it -- lol
( ... and i guess the extension of that is that exporting a type itself has semantic associations ; and
i thought it was something we resolved , then the news article came up : )
so what are you trying to do ? : )
not seen the subscription in solitaire then ?
a usb stick
oh i ca n't help with autopilot , but there should be others around that can
good question , it 's more a hypothetical question : p
yeah ... well ... used to
ignore him - it wo n't happen again
right , but ready to play ! = pipeline all set up
then you did n't read the link or what the bot said ; so please do so now .
there 's a difference to update or upgrade to newer version
no need for sudo
idk
that would be lubuntu lxde i guess
oh tnx for letting us know
i suspect it was started by someone who did n't understand what they were doing and then other people copied
that 's a really huge undertaking to implement something like that , i do n't think it 's going to
and you ? which version ?
this channel is mostly just a bunch of fellow users - it 's not an official channel for reporting problems
i 'm too exhausted to join , listening passively
how can we disable new armhf/ppc64el jobs , i. e. the triggering from the x86 ones ? in the jenkins
you can try them all out and then uninstall the ones you do n't like .
okay , so what problem are you trying to solve then : ) if you have the texture id ,
phew ! glad to hear it : )
so wat is the solution ?
oh ok
you 're not asking a support question .
: d better new kindle than separate rooms : )
yeah i 'm trying to look at sendmailconfig to see if there 's some simple way to just get it
and when it stops just start is back up
nope , thats weekend work ...
in ota6 : /usr/share/accounts/applications/contacts-sync.application
maybe a reinstall
you want another efibootmgr -v from the installed system ?
i 'm looking on the gigabyte support site for the mobo revision and at the 'bios ' updates , and
tested this on lts ?
this channel is only for ubuntu support , not polls
yes , i do this every time i install kubuntu . just seems like one of the useability things that
`` pkg=mypackage ; apt-cache show `` $ pkg '' | egrep '^ ( package|installed-size ) : ''
it 's not a matter of mping , we just have to set the environment variables
can you get further with photorec ?
re that current one
ca n't we get that toned down a bit ? constant i/o like that ? ? ?
original code failed to account for tags with spaces , new code can handle it and test case proves it
there 's a file that can be touched to make it run again
but which program does this connection tracking by default ?
and is it possible to know what all commands were issued ?
looking
i see . while you ran unetboot in ubuntu you opened folders in the program and moved them
then you have one chance : chrome browser ( with buildin drm stuff )
also can you suggest how can i set notification when my battery level reaches a certain level ...
what abou compiling it from source ?
not `` haha '' , it 's a great relief : )
yeah , i just do n't understand that magic , i 'm a muggle ; - )
ah , i was wondering about this `` little kernel '' the whole time ; ) it 's just uboot
installing the ubuntu-sdk also installs the qtcreator ide , along with other developer tools .
i 'm just checking this is the expected outcome : )
ok. how would i disable services on 12.04.5 ?
i had no way to login , the direct link you gave me , logged me in ; - )
how should we update bugs now that the code and bugs are separate ? fix committed when it gets merged
^^
hehe ; )
i know , i 'm installing nightly
ahh i see
soee says there is a 5.3 final , have you tried that ?
/home/t/android-sdk-linux/tools : /home/t/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools
there is no such thing as a generic bootloader for arm ; )
perhaps , you should ask your real question instead ...
installing 14.10
so i can upgrade to 16.04 lts from 15.10 or any 15.xx ?
correct . i tried apt-get install and it worked however . i dont know why but it hit this time
you have n't used windows lately ?
oh , you are right , got triggered by nickserv
nope . it shows me as logged in but no edit button
worst case just overwrite the bluetooth.conf completely , keep the old stuff in there aand add what you need additionally
but this is a lexmark printer re-branded by dell . do you still think the hp toolbox will do something
yes , it 's a known regression
maybe it 'll give you some hints
agh , same problem here .
you dont need a kernel 3.4 running for that
he should be here shortly .
i did , that 's how i found out the -p command , but i ca n't find out which
+1 but i dislike the error message changes : - )
if you have any questions , comments , or concerns , feel free to ask the lococouncil mailing list or
i see you put the fake timers inside the test itself , i thought you 'd put it in a
if i 'd have to guess , it 's as if it gets tricked on window boundary or some such
the device must have developer mode enabled and the device must be unlocked ... and plugged in via a usb
eg the context.flush stuff
default qxl
it does not `` 0 updated , 0 newly installed , 0 to remove and 428 not updated ''
it 's immensely useful to read advice that 's given
by `` all '' , i mean the two packages in that mir , and paramiko .
marcoceppi - here 's a use case to consider :
you would have to ask mint . ; )
yes
i was n't being creative , but not related to that problem .
the kernel/udevd looks for all firmware files in `` /lib/firmware/ '' - transfer the file to that directory and when
how did you fix it ?
exactly
we really reccomend with ubuntu : p
menno responded to the ci test failure with some comments , thread title is `` cursed ( final ) :
as we switched languages and backends it gradually made less sense but was always basically just a straight port
gparted ... it 's on the ubuntu usb
but i did actually get in now with the oldest rev of utopic , so i guess i 'm fine
is there any network comms going on ? you could monitor with tcpdump
the problem should be to gennerate deb.. and what source code ubuntu uses for policykit-1 ?
that 's why for a while i entertained making client a separate project entirely
noting also that , in the thread , amodra himself claims he 's building his own compilers with -m32 turned
i 'll dig into it a bit .
if you 're asking which would take longer , then i 'd say urandum would take longer .
nothing we were using yet , but when trying to improve the conflict handling using merge_file_from_index , we ended up
i would test the memory with memtest . that segfault comes out of the blue
hello not so anonymous anon .
do you have a reason for that ? 14.04 is supported until 2019 , 15.04 is supported until january 2016
can you tell me more how to do this : `` try to see if 'rmmod ' of the driver
look in your logs to see what you removed
well , i guess using ubuntu-app-test would be that feature , but for now i 'm happy to get it
doh
i would welcome that ... but saviq suggested it ...
i have that too
interrupted distro upgrade = unstable , unreliable system . download the .iso , make a usb , clean install
i 've synced camlp4 now , that should make this glitch go away
are you going todo a general charm helper sync post that ?
np
i 've seen same disk appearing twice if it 's connected on multipath
now-a-days i am windows illitterate . others will have to offer advise for working from the windows platform .
packing time
maybe ... have to check with team . my section i have to rewrite as the content is mostly the
im still n00b with linux sorry
yaay !
let me knoe if you disagree
yep , i 've been playing around , the key is in tarmac 's host
or pick a bug that looks nice and easy : )
no its not mac hardware , i have used it in alienware
not weird , that 's your new 9.res that 's not updated to cimi 's new shadow
why did you ban me ?
best to ask # vbox that
it 's not wrong , daftykins told you where to get help
i was moaning that cab were complaining about something which i do n't think is accurate
no i am not using a bridge
have you noticed strange behaviour in focus switching between applications ?
i really think this can just be another spin of ..ubuntu2
the goal was to self contain this thing , i do n't see the makefile installing tox
what kind of video card do you have ? ati ? nv ?
as you can see there are still traces installed . purge the virtualbox-5.0 package .
no , it was n't -- the error above is the line immediately below that
i am pretty sure that you can open another one .
it 's not that , i just do n't believe in upgrades .
you have tried what ? what command ? i used the `` chown '' command , at the wiki i
yes
yes , in theory
many apps export a menubar even with csd
know anything about the new firefox addon system ? : /
where do we get golib from ? google is n't being very helpful for me there
< insert witty retort here >
android as client to pc
because i ca n't detect the internal wifi card so i need a friver
yeah - but only upstream
there 's also managing with landscape
true . we could make a mode for that .
dont understand your question
you know you do n't have to restart it if you change the config , you can just reload it
yes
mail is out
seems like that could do with some constant folding
yeah wily is better for dual silos
i run the dns authoria
oh , i 'll try there
it 's a backup job that copied terabytes of data
that was efficient , how did you find it ?
correct
well android and ios do it . we do it for sms and calls
i do n't personally know , you might email ubuntu-devel and ask
you welcome , our new team leader : d
i do n't think so . popey ; do you see the `` question : '' when you do q
no errors , and in windows it works like a rocket , very fast , very responsive
i almost never have a machine that cant run ubuntu on it
well , essentially when i get the blank decrypt screen , i can enter my password and press enter .
yes
but right now i 'm doing api design for the clients , will use json via websockets
dont know
ca n't take it out of the dock right now , but i 'll try in a bit
might have to top approve that one as well
old enough to forget your birthday i am sure
copy and paste for commands works wonderfully .
but why the video-player app `` needs '' the `` gallery app '' ?
i have installed ubuntu 12.04 and make my server as ltsp server.the problem now is if my clients connecting pendrive
when will kubuntu ci get ppc64el ? surely that 's easy to add : )
i ca n't remember - i 'm happy to update developer.u.c and let folks on both lists know
most of the time , you can force with pre-depends the orders
yeah it was news to me as well : (
first install another display manager ( lightdm , mdm , lxdm etc ) during install it will ask which one
check out your /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* ( i.e . all the files in there ) for any referring to ``
if we gate all nm landings via ci we can do better , per previous discussions
the getattrs are getting to you : )
indeed , i did n't realize we had n't kept you in the loop , sorry
yeah , it 's progressed quite nicely over the years ; i remember not too long ago ( it seems
ls -l /usr/bin/updatedb.mlocate
how comes ?
yeah , if that 's current then we 're stuck , proposed has some migration issues
yeah , it 's in 1.22
then you know which bits to ignore : - )
the other things that are already on the agenda ? : d
perhaps i can do update , lets see
i might have you beat
both ways
nothing in the bios
yes , but not in -proposed
again , bringing that childish attitude in here is a great way to get ignored : )
ok , going for 11.0rc seems interesting but better in conjunction with kernel 4.2 and skl
for what reason ?
ok i 'll give you the output
ubuntu-touch/rc-proposed/bq-aquaris.en might be the best option if you just want newish but fairly stable stuff ( that 's basically what
thats , that rules out systemd
i would encourage it .
field from what i can see is n't applied correctly
that 's in trunk only right now . is that going to work ?
did it mention windows ?
use the dh approach ! : )
if you are on a dynamic ip , i do n't recommend it
would be cooler to get a more direct way : p
did you run the apt-get command i suggested ?
both to see how it 's been thrown and also you might be able to do integration to handle loss
and same result with that ?
15.04 is being used for production by a few folks
and another question , what are you using as host ?
? let me try again
s/no/now
arfe you dput'ing ?
i 'll take a look now , should n't take long
ok , i 'll take another look at it
what 's your opinion on interpreting x-ubuntu-touch=true as `` expects touch lifecycle '' ?
i remember reading somewhere , something about dbus ... tl ; dr probly broke something
ok so 6 tests failed 27 passed . a few of the fails look like actual bugs in the tests
?
can you help me out ?
well , you received an order confirmation i guess . thats the lilst of hardware you ordered : )
confirmed that both arale and krillin are 100 % phased percentage , so everyone should see the update
so i should be fine or what should i do ?
good night to you then ; )
and without -- arch=i386 ?
regreat what ?
have you tried changing your screen resolution ? your desktop could be bigger than what your display can render .
got ta get release notes together .
iirc none of the standard kernels work without pae - perhaps try debian ?
i 've added dumping of all routes , links , and addresses at the end of the script
i 'll make a note in the request to keep you updated on progress
yeah , i 've run into similar problems with this network topology with maas and juju both . virtualbox just
# gdisk list /dev/sd ?
yep . file bugs when you find breakages . are you running -proposed ?
so your xauthority file is in your home directoy ,
feel free to ask fginther for a re-run once disabled if i 'm not around.. brb
are you testing the latest build , with the fix from today ?
i 'd wait for wily to release first
check softwarecenter > history , or /var/log/apt/history.log what you installed
but it seems i can drag items off the right side of the screen never to be seen again
how 's the windows driver for the 750ti ?
raid1 on a notebook is nice
which app ?
: p
ah poop , i do n't have the right vpn configured , gim me a few minutes to sort that
what about when people say `` umbunto '' or `` ubunut '' ?
yap
istm that you could save a mongo round trip in every single api call by using common.newtoolsurlgetter ( st.environtag (
i tried
you 've probably already checked , but there are sometimes settings to influence it in the bios setup
but would that be what you are looking for ?
well , that 's exciting
settings do not apply . when i close and reopen settings , the state from before the changes is there
yeah , not a big deal for this no-op test . : )
i have no way of knowing what packages are installed on your system .
hey , more eyes available in # ubuntu
usually the ubuntu stays at the kernel it was shipped with . but the lts releases can use the hardware
heh , it 's been like this for years , first time someone had a problem
yay ! works
it 's not bad as such , it 's just sub-optimal in terms of aligned i/o reads/writes
try /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -- print
ok , remove libopencl from conflicts : provides and replaces
a quick command from a live session could confirm the hard disk 's status
hmmmmmmmmmm ... ... ... ...
sometimes
do you know what it fixes ? seems like zooming and a couple others
it can be an int for example
just read the backlog
if you could update charm to use lgpl like in github.com/juju/utils/license that would be great . got confirmation from mark
do n't worry , it 's not landing just yet
ymmv - its chunking up a custom client based on whats in your local environment , does n't follow the
looks clean
it shows `` grub loading '' and do nothing after that
not file or directory ( i 'm sorry i can not be exact now because now i 'm on windows
agreed . : p
yes , i have seen that mr . it is good , but obviously it is for vivid only
just out of curiosity , otherwise you can go ahead and copy everything or modify whatever if you want ,
/join # winehq after checking the appdb
not directly , but it tries to execute it , which fails
i assumed it was on purpose : - )
ok that needs a lot of work .
... the music player .
right now i 'm doing a very basic test :
do you want the review here or in the branch ?
either way , neither are supported .
right but if any packages are on from any of them right now ... here be dragons
i mean depends : a | b
not really that i know of ; i 've pinged the people looking at that bug , and they are
makes sense doesnt it . use he os and let the do the tasks they can already do ... or
i am logged in as 'ubuntu ' via the live disk
when i tried it , i get `` package architecture ( i386 ) does not match system ( amd64 )
here it says the same
no .
is the driver module for the device loaded in the live-usb os ?
i never joke on irc *cough*
yes - we know - bug 1425047
there might be , who knows
well setting that ?
cli
you can probably also configure sudo to let your pals run a few specific commands as a specific user..
< name here > ?
ah , i 've totally lost track of juju version numbering : )
we want something similar no ? convergence in all dimensions !
this channel is for ubuntu support , you can chat in # linux to pick a distribution
do i need slides ?
if it does not work , it wo n't work in my place as well .
yes just make sure your output in system settings > phonon devices shows spdif and hdmi out
ok , so let me use that , i 'll abandon it in a moment
why is it not built in by default ? both android and ios have default email clients
no
the whole point of fakeapi is to fulfil the provisioner.apicalls interface
it also brought in a new juju/utils dependency , this is the log for that :
to install deb files : sudo dpkg -i /path/to/filename.deb
it should validate that given plugin == midonet and source being one of mem/midonet , that the right calls are
what did you try to do ? how did you try to do it ? what did you expect to
yeah , it seems to have started in the latest image
so if i wanted to try the real deskto version which one should i go for ?
calligraactive.install is still around but it 's not listed in debian/control so the result will be just the same (
yeah , i 've seen huge `` enterprise systems '' containing tons of never called code . but nobody ever
i see .
hey happy new york to you too : p
i 've spent most of my day looking at bug 1478232 and i 'm now beginning to think they 're
all other watchers
run the programs gparted , or disks .
if it rebooted will it have overwritten that proc/last_kmsg ?
yeah , it sounds like a good improvement
and again , unity8 unity8-dash and maliit crashes , it took nearly 2 minutes to boot
nope
right , so i thought we discuss it in a debian bug , then implement it in ubuntu , and
i see gfxblacklist.txt i386-pc/ locale/ fonts/ grubenv grub.cfg
though it does n't make a lot of sense that if it does n't break the boot , it then
hmm ... i guess i personally would set all to 10 mins
and md5sum the .iso first to make sure its a clean ubuntu iso
err , what ?
the site is up and running , but the charm seems to set up only the gunicorn upstart job as

adobe no longer supports linux flash ...
the webupd8 guys are maintaning a ppa for this to make it easier for users to install the app as

because core is installed anyway , that means germinate ignores xserver-xorg-video-all , and it goes byebye .

maybe thats helpful ? i.e . put the snapcraft.yaml directly into your go source and use `` source : .
likely even the defaults should work fine
if you do n't know about things , you can ask questions , it 's not good to tell others
ok , i do n't htink the openstack charms are released for vivid . at least none in the charm
oh , my mistake , may apt/packages or apt/pkgs , i 'm sure since i do n't have ubuntu here
just remove all lists and try it again
the debian maintainer for taskflow has it building for python 3 now , so that 's another blocker gone .

uh ? i 'm in no way talking about codifying `` the tb can overrule ''
i would n't try that with windows disk images personally .

the main story is that you need the schroots set up by the click wrapper

no it wo n't . once you upgrade to a supported released you can install that program .
probably , fix those ( probably udev/systemd ) and the rest will slot in fine .
well , after updating , it disappeared
fdisk isnt even able to format something . fdisk partitions things .
so , can you add a comment in the mp on what you 'd like from us/me for you to
yes good point .
do you have a specific issue in mind ?
i *think* we have now switched to v4 auth for s3 , perhaps there 's an issue in that region
`` do not use format or partitioning utilities , they will delete your key ! '' -- i say they
let 's do 10 mins anyway . would be good to talk about it .
because i was already using it
you already asked this question
wild guess , look into /var/log/xorg.0.log
the answer is always ogra ... ..who broke this ogra , who fixed this ogra , who implemented this craziness
i just ubuntu bug'ed it
nice
apps should rotate , the dash is fixed
you mean `` testing sdl ''
well , yeah ... slangasek wanted to wait a bit before he changes that
monkeydust : so , only there ? no other thoughts ?
it 'd be nice to get a bug filed against that in the right place
there 's a test rebuild in progress , hence the high job count .
yeah ... that 's another point . is n't jack here ?
it must be coming from britain , then ?
are you on kodi ?
the desktop is gone
i would look into my gpu.. i would see if i can get the desktop looking `` right '' with
what issues did you get ?
no servers message again
hmm , i see the debian/ dir is not in those repos . should i propose packaging changes to lp
do n't hang yourself : -p
methinks your issue , as valorie pointed out , is a matter of the drivers shipped , and your hardware
i was trying in the `` disk '' app ?
my thoughts too
did you ever see mary poppins ?
just going up to the point of needing to ender the username/password on the paypal page is enough to verify
ok , in fact it does work , it 's just that multimonitor makes it more complex
note that this ota takes a long time with no feedback that it is doing anything
current updates is based on ckt7 ?
debug all code o/ !
i 've dual gpu 's . intel & nvidia . you can select with the proper drivers .
i 'm working with tvoss on that other silo still
^^
ill take a look at it to change it back to sddm.org.etc
is there an app in the store using this which i can test ?
suggest you use the ubuntu-kylin channels for your questions .
i can login from ctrl+alt+f1
i see it picked up the tarball now
no , it is not that
is that what gedit looks like on macos ?
as long as it is sequential , random writes or too many streams that it ends up like random is
this is a volunteer channel , you are not *owed* help
thought it would be appreciated : )
there 's a free upgrade to windows 10 ?
planning on adding more of the same style , glad you like it
nothing happens when you do control alt f1 ?
but did you run the tests on a vm ?
are you offered any a little older ?
there are many methods , | less is my personal fav
also . maybe the upgrade step should just skip files it ca n't move ? witha warning ?
oh - wait - the neutron-gateway charm also runs the nova-api-metadata service
i 'm evaluating ubuntu before installing fully
you going to root at any point ?
is there other ways to make indicator-sound send notifications on unity7 ?
the kc is a concerned party in the consequences , but not the cause
no , that doesnt work . neither does reisub
yes i did , so do backports of some necessary feature never happen ?
the partition can only be resized if there is free space immediately following it
done
> = wily just copies everything in /etc/udev/rules.d/ into the initramfs ( which does n't have a counterpart in /lib/udev/rules.d/
i saw that diff , it 's what made me ping you
nothing wrong with running long term support ( lts )
yeh i mean it wont break ; but i do n't think i 'd have it public
scroll up
we had some users having xenial issues in virtualbox aswell
ah
azure is being a pita
no , it compiles fine . just fails the testsuite .
how ? terminal scroll doens't go back that far
theres no way other than using up to date software .
took a while for me and salem_ to figure out what it was , but in the end salem_ fixed

this is just in time , i ran out of eps of the series i was watching
yes
for basic keyboard hotkeys please take a look at how to configure openbox hotkeys . there is an .xml config
that message means i tried to load the input-stub.so which is a testing utility ( lacking a mirclient dependency )
why would you need that ?
yes .
i created a new sources.list by a website , because it was destoryed before .
that 's probably it .
i do n't think you can with their disk formats .
ai ?
th-taht is a good question ... i really do n't know x :
my hope is that the unity 8 developers , along with the qa community , will be more involved in
`` pastebinit /var/log/xorg.0.log '' might shed some light on what 's up
no
not really important to me , just interesting
and i ask you again . is that 2nd hard drive set in bios as the 1st boot priority ?
i 'm working through them ... it looks like the first was because i needed bzr , now it seems
can you ls -l that file
sudo apt-get install libxext6 : i386
okay , cool
tryed both slot , but ill try again tomorrow also
yes you will have a lot to learn and understand to use linux with games
how do i know i have the au or the bu version though ?
yes - and when it 's done o'clock
ubuntu automatically upgrades flashplayer

i have no idea what a basket is . was that some other charm aggregation scheme ?
change /usr/share/xfce4/helpers/firefox.desktop
i have hard it once from mirv
e.g . consider you do $ juju deploy postgres -- constraints spaces=db , ^apps -- to zone=one-of-the-zones-not-matching-db
no , but it wites stuff raw at the beginning of the disk , see the boot-assets in the meta/package.yaml
ok , that does n't tell me what device names i should use though
ah , good point
but if i reboot ... i 'll suddenly gain 8gb back .
yeah . the `` and follow '' bit is the important part . snaps we produce , or docker images
and leave sshd alone
directories and files that start with a period '. ' do n't show in a standard 'ls ' output .
if someday you need the flashplayer again , find on google for windows npfsw.dll
i do n't speak bzr well enough to know what that combination does , but sure ?
libmbim , network-manager and modemmanager .
i know that , i do n't understand where it 's set
just a blank white screen . no decorations or anything .
tmux survives x restarts ; )

elaborate ? if you can please .
yeah that is why i like clonezilla . i just looked for clonezilla that would likely be online
yup
ahhh
there are plenty of other guides and walkthroughs as it 's a common issue , so read around a bit
good point . i was n't on lts before this , why am i getting antsy about it now ?
could that error message be the problem ? incorrect uefi installation ?
its just a name change due to copyrights stuff because the developer got a new workplace
public ipv6 . they should already have routes . that is the luxury of ipv6 , there is no nat
hey marco !
you ca n't just throw that out there without knowing where someone is in the world .
hey , i 've reviewed the packaging branch , needs info , due to the lack of -b in the
can you also pastebin the full traceback ?
uninstall flash installer
good stuff . come back when you are more grown up perhaps .
or someone with a rubberhose
is not the correct way with the add_attribute_mapping ?
-- resolution is also good
did not help
do n't worry , and take your time
and i 'm telling you that changing scripts in /etc/grub.d/ on debian based oss will cause upgrades of grub-common to
`` something '' isnt anything to solve issues . we need the exact message .
does it involve hardware ?
ok
jhodapp : sadly , no free silos available : (
ack
i usually have 2 pxe entries per iso ... 1 standard and one unpacked on the server file-system so it
e.g . if i create a new file , that is safe , but if i edit a packaged file
and sudo cp /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi
good , yourself ?
maybe you could make a screenshot and upload it to imgur.com ?
whats the line from 'df -h ' now
if you run `` ubuntu-device-flash touch -- channel=ubuntu-touch/devel '' in the terminal after connecting your phone to your laptop ,

if we just disable snappy , thats all i need
right ... . and you still get null pointer
that is really unfortunate to hear .
4096 bytes sectors used for > 2tb 'advanced format ' devices
of course it is possible .
you actually have to give it a push to the left to get it to reveal
oh , well having a boot as ext2 is usually a good idea
why should that be ? did you try dist-upgrade ? ? ( it will not upgrade to the next ubuntu
there was also a mir landing
nah the full suite - quickbasic 4.5
can you give me a link ?
yep
robru , davmor2 , ogra_ , rvr : ok , let 's skip it then : )
could you paste the output of 'dpkg -l|grep nvidia ' again ?
if you have to copy a large number of files , or have large files , rsync over ssh will
yes , a lot .
i 'm about to make some more signficant changes that will almost certainly break things : )
?
lol
anything that touches rtm needs a check and we needed to make a single process for everything
the person called `` northreign '' claims it did ?
is there an upstream bug as well ?
did you try a sudo apt-get update ?
yep works perfectly .
so , honestly , i 'm going to have to just politely decline . but given that any core-dev can
using nouveau ?
basically i am minded not to do a2
?
seems it 's from today : /
c bon e5er we7ed hedha lila ?
see the ipv6 in the last line of the logs , the weird ipv4 returned in the mdns response ,
i can upload 5.4.2 if you 're busy fighting with backports
try a lighter desktop , like xubuntu , but still high cpu with video is normal even then
yep
people keep asking me `` are you serious '' if i show them my phone and they get to see
it is n't minute by minute ... last update was almost 30 minutes ago..
i run juju 's ci . it deploys stable and test juju 's to verify cloud-health and juju 's health
the first click logs you in with openid . click again and it should go
^^
space management
are you hitting that in rtm ?
let me check git
but you never know i guess ...
this is ubuntu support , not bsd
so the pr should be updated now with a link to the review request
all changelogs have 'disable compression to avoid crime systemwide ' , and a quick grep of 'compress ' in debian/
i have only ssh access , for console , you mean if i can hit shift / esc to enter
all that unfettered internet is bad for you
that is not a reconfigure problem
also as arleady told to you , sim contacts import is not supported yet
i 'm just old .
bear in mind that these models evolved from the old software centre ones , which were based on .deb packages
ok - so id you do n't know , please listen to advice , this is not the right way
i 'm cynical like that
if you 're not on the sudoers list you wo n't be able to sudo to root .
you can use mysqldump to export it
on the run i had running on the other machine i got :
is sdc external ?
that 's probably easier in vbox rather than vagrant
is the remote a linux host as well ? i presume so
usually , if you have a debian/foo.init and debian/foo.service , it 'll just work
but that 's rubbish , nowhere would format a drive to test it .
ok , you can also view logs in realtime with tail -f /var/log/syslog next time
ok
do you know a device ( router ) that suits ?
not from before the superblock was wiped
trashcan
wrong
i 'll start documenting some things i understand .
yes
i 'll ask the question but you have added a relation between keystone and the dashboard right ?
?
then tell us your graphics card .
yes ... this snooze stuff is for 1.3 which is targetted for post-vivid..
keep it down , or i 'm going to make you do bug triage
that seems odd , do you see anything happening on the screen ? how about if you try to run
probably , yes
i was supposed to be working on that today fwiw
you never setup mon0 properly
ok , see you tomorrow .
yeah
^ ?
ok . i see . but it does n't run tar . just 'preview ' the command list . usefull
libmirclient.so.9
how ? ?
i mean see the error notif
haha , i did not plan to post too many memes no .
depending which way they choose they have to specify subibs or not
right , having seen that description in use , i can probably agree it 's a tad long . that
that doesnt make it on topic
i have both installed on my utopic and nothing 's broken yet : )
it 's also why it 's explicitly marked as not supported in anything but x86 : /
x most likely , ... but avail from v onward from a ppa
that 's cool - just let me know
remember the gateway , your router
: )
okay , hold on .
normal . auto-updates complete , aptlock released ...
i do n't have any devices that do n't show a name
boot using pendrive , then reinstall grub . see if that works .
what state is your machine in , what problems do you percieve ?
after using ubuntu_bug and signing in it has a few extra questions to describe the scenario
it will be my weekend project ...
make sure your packages are up to date , it 's always the first thing to check
can i do fsck now from tty1 on live cd ?
the question was `` how to fix a key not being accepted or get to the bottom of it ''
that is possible , but then hostname and uname show it as ubuntu
the nice thing about that is that the diffs are easier to read than delete/readd
does that make sense ? i hacked that into a deployed system and it works fine afaict
ubuntu 's desktop theme could use a refresh
more like `` no ... i did n't even look '' ... right ?
mmm , do you use any proprietary drivers ? ( graphics etc )
just do n't forget the seed too
right
sorry , typo again ! ! ! `` dig +short iam.tj 127.0.1.1 ''
which packages did you intend to land ?
no i upgraded
mginormous
i took a deeper look at merge ( ) with the individual states of the ips etc
understood
not supersecure , but reasonable as a try-out .
i wasnt telling the truth
do you want me @ akademy ? if so should i request funds from ubuntu again ?
blocked by that branch , then will land it , sorry
whoa
are you still able to ssh in ?
only soft-blocked is set to `` no ''
so not that then
sounds right , freakin cold
ok thnx
file it against the media-hub source package
not that i would know of , but i could check
but i managed to build a quite elaborate qt creator project which already bundles all the missing armhf libraries ,
basicly , ssh adds the search domain to servers , but ignores it when checking dns keys ... or at
he ca n't connect to the servers ...
which release of ubuntu was it you used the installer for , that encrypted the /home partition ? the installer
we ca n't really put the tests in debian/tests as they access the internet , and they require an snappy
why do you register amazonclientsuite twice btw ?
i 've seen it , but i ca n't make any of it , sorry
krnekhelesh @ gmail.com
whenever u get ssh access working properly , use the scp command to copy the key
wrong merge target : /
apparently ! pushed now
are you in the live usb ?
any other conflicting dhcp serve running on same lan ?
do you think they 're good enough to go into backports ?
typically , the creators of the hardware hire , for example , a team of professionals to write software drivers
can you email me some proposal stories
even if i can not reproduce the issue on my desktop
do you have plasma 5.3 installed ? , it seems to have better integration than 5.2 default
included in the .desktop ?
because 1.21.2 is not released yet ( due tomorrow )
if its working locally , and not from the internet side , then , you may also *not* be allowed
so if it 's not supported anymore , are you saying you did n't get it from ubuntu 's repos
but you can test already now also , and help solving bugs also
i started doing the list as another review of the code , but would it be more useful in textual
trying to have sane /etc and sane /usr is impossible .
delete .ssh or just authorized_keys ?
also where did you get the source code for kdeconnect plasma ?
3-line hotfix
xchat hasnt been developed for 4 years now , its dead
so true , but i love to experiment as a developer myself ; )
q staging ?
where it makes sense , yes .
this is n't even in bios , the winbond chip operates independently apparently .
also i obviously did n't expect to not have to re-look at things
those seem to be all over the stack , so wondering how silo 55 can be ready for testing
i can try that just to see .
virtualbox ?
somebody would have to make that donation
cool , will you shoot me a mail when it 's in ?
chdist is very nice , especially when i am working with a few different ppa 's

looks like either kenral downgrade up upgrade would solve your problems , but that 's beyond my knowledge scope
ok
checking graphics card
it shows up right at the bootup , i do n't think it starts sddm
this is n't a chat channel . # ubuntu-offtopic for that please
possibly . do you have a dual graphic card system or just nvidia card
on an external disk
yes , the one that has a funny paragraph that you have to agree with .
on it
no
worth a shot . remember to 'sudo update-grub ' after the file is saved .
yes - can do the standard qt part . just wondering about the apparmor constraints about what i can and
and set to legacy boot only
ahh yes , let me do that now
actually i get it more often than the valid output

indeed , on a fugging mac , too
yes .
whats the issue mate
do you know where i can customize the open file dialog window ?
ok ... `` pastebinit < ( dd if=/dev/sda count=16 bs=512 | hexdump -c ) ''
sounds like you 're not using the bash shell - what does `` echo $ shell '' report ?
so its only after using your browser and clicking a torrent
lets cross our fingers : p

the bane of every wiki : (
can i test it somehow ?
should n't have one
i seem to remember ...
and it looks like ci already used the machine and confirmed that master does love vivid .
done
can you see that ?
see where you are setting the xtrem color ?
yes . it 's called persistent boot and tools like unetbootin or multisystem will set that up for you with

ive done the ubuntu-restricted extras
configure them in nvidia software , then hit the save to x configuration file . then the settings should stick

there 's no file for it
a good place for ?
by `` grab a terminal '' , from where i am @ installer step ? or continue without bootloader ,
are you talking about windows flashing ?
what 's cat /etc/issue say ?
nah . every var in caps .
i dont have .xinitrc
already released : - )
great ! i 'll keep you posted ; )
you can either use the terminal to mount it `` read-only '' so that you ca n't change any files
try rebooting it too incase it got caught in some crazy loop , might help , might not , just
regular ubuntu , desktop , amd64 , wily
yes please
if you absolutely must run both oss on the bare metal of this machine , then i 'd say a
try sudo apt-get install -- reinstall xserver-xorg-video-ati
i 'd say no , nothing `` kde '' ish in debian/rules or control
did you change anything ?
i mean something outside the osk that can change the osk back to number mode *even if you have already
not on your system
you have ipv6 too , or what 's going on ?
yeah that should be okay as well . i was just trying to get it in before the daily image
manually typing ok , silo 016
that 's where yahoo ! makes their revenue
well , i guess it 's ev 's one in that case , but i doubt he will work on
the trick is this : as long as your windows username and password exactly match your linux/samba username and password
ask # bash
daftykins yes sure

ok , seems we are good for now
: d too true
hi installing windows 8.1 and now ubuntu booting menu gone as dual booting
sublime is good for python and also for all kinds of web stuff
yeah , no worries
that makes no sense
ah , well i have a work-in-progress that will address that
i 'm seein 122 here
dont remove it , then
as well as the scaling being very strange
iirc it was a issue with netrunner where kate was n't co installable with kate5
the above recommendation is what i tried too..let me show what i actually did..
you should be a lot more aware of what you do and read when it comes to root priviledges
my bios added boot option # 1 [ uefi : generci usb f ... . ]
no , that 's ok . i 'll just amke sure we 've got it covered in the upcoming release

ask # ubuntukylin-devel for recommendations
but running osx in a virtual machine is crappy . its easier to just buy a mac
is that what you are asking there ?
however as it 'd dual landing and it 's in qa queue , i asked qa to prioritize it
cool , it is confusing at first , it was for me anyway . ; )
how do you normally compile a project for armhf so far ? cross-compile is not supported by the tool .
you do : ) knowledge is power
it is possible for a desktop environment to offer such features , however i do not think that unity 7
not distro-specific in any way , either
i 'm going to try to revive a toshiba satellite 1555cds
a snappy core system is ( or tries to be ) *very* stripped down

are you sure it 's intel ? who knows
so is simply 'push , edit , commit , push ' wrong ?
upstart can load things in parallel while init.d linear
did you install the ubuntu-sdk-libs package ?
that what pbuilder / pbuilder-dist does , builds chroot that is arch and version specific . debboostrap is used to
i 'm up late doing ( another ) maas install

you can have pie if you look at bug 1408495
sorry , i got pulled away . in a meeting now , but will respond
okay , that 's not a problem
pastebin please .
are you tired of trello ? : - )
well , or block it ... we should make sure not more people upgrade to it
when trying to fix a failed ci test any improvement to the total time-to-test-comletion is super helpful
( and it 's hard , so would need a significant slot of time )
all done !
you probably have to be registered and recognised , # freenode can help you with that .
i use logwatch too , did not notice it was reporting packages that could be updated
sdl2 requests a surface from the mir server
i 'm running linkchecker over the namespace

thats not what i told you to do
yes : )

i 'll have a closer look

i would talk to # freenode
did you choose lightdm at installation , i assumed you chose sddm
okay now set the color
okay , i 'm giving this upgrade bug one final pock ( i may have stockholm syndrome )

yeah , otherwise you 're quite a bit behind

the upgrades needs a vividupgrades page for 14.10 - > 15.04 upgrades
correct
sounds ok ; especially since we can drop them again at some point
do you know if there are any programs out there like ifunbox or anything to be able to access the
you know , even now , you should use common sense .
no i get these ca issues from time to time when installing standard packages with apt .
because i had the solution for that : )
i 'm saying i have no idea what program you 're talking about , and that a link to something
it just took ages
run ps aux read down the list and see if something is holding apt dpkg open kill it and then
that 's amazon
not much

yeah , so should i not be sruing to vivid and just relying on a new mir via an overlay

i did
yes , it passed the last cycle sru testing
i always delete the old package before changing anything
yes

the file was there , because a handle to it was open . all that was missing was the entry
you can always just delete the cache and force a policy reload
it has some nice features

yeah i know , but that 's what feels wrong to me
i always use legacy . there might be steps you have to take to go uefi
indeed
if you start using spinoffs then you will get lesser support due to user base
so its a makefile issue .

mulitple open tabs and plugins will do that

1. in the context of your question ps = postscript
did you have same issues on 14.04 ?

network-manager-gnome is a whooping 4.7mbs in my case heeh

`bin/test -cvvt xx-` should be catching all doctests yes ?
i guess we will
what is quanton ?
cheers !
yes ...
lsof
first thing i do if a de goes south and i ca n't fix it fast is install another ,
perhaps even if only to the ubuntu charm
right , i thought so . i 'll report it and get it fixed
with update i mean sudo apt-get update
veebers : this one succeeded : )
that is fine.. but middle of some package installation it will reboot with out asking a single question..
can you doublecheck the horizon upload ... there is a _lot_ of code removed
if possible , mini if not server > > > desktop
sure . that could be changed though if we thought it was better to do it the other way
: )
nope
they have seasonal themes too : )
is there a way to set attach_disconnected for every single profile on the system without having to mangle them all
obviously it 's using systemd-init so on the kernel command-line try starting it with `` systemd.crash_shell=true '' so it starts
it 's cheating
hehe

it may also be in the mounted images , /mnt/whatever/sbin/pivot_root

yeah , that is probably a bit premature : )
look at the two topmost results -- the second one is newer than the first , but it was n't
why ftp ? it 's awful
ah thats right .
running make manually ( outside of qtc ) creates the same error ?
what 's the error ?
/boot/grub/grub.cfg
do i have the right one ?
mostly you will buy an uefi machine , and ubuntu will run just fine on it
that command lets you see the output as well as sending it to pastebin
i reinstalled ubuntu from from start .
i dont think secure boot really matters in this case
yea , i had the same experience with firewalld on rhel/fedora clients
ok
the command you run with csh goes through a chooser that picks what to run , you can change it
i refuse adding flags to my kernel or consider it a driver issue
dist-upgrade should fix that or else get the drivers from lenovo
its just the `` -- user= '' thats added automatically in the pkcon and the nicer auth via pkexec

i finally accomplished the first task i was given when i started canonical .
ok , we 'll do so , for now let 's hold
even more nonsense .
cool , no problem !
ah , makes sense
so you mean during upgrade process for ubuntu it can still write to /boot/grub ?
but as you know the main obstacle for a packager is obtaining debian git access
well , this is all on vms that can be torn down & re-initialised at a moment 's notice ...
now sure how it being a dell matters ...
but that 's not excuse for baking the stupidity in at implementation level

i can only suggest you install ubuntu and make your life more easy
no worries ! i 'm glad we figured it out .
not found - let me check earlier in the log
hah , whoops . so if you say the name of the os properly , you 're right . if
i have n't done anythink like that .
i use it on files for friends who run windows , i agree that it is handy
yeah , you can delete obexd
what version , and is this in a vm
silo 2
it has that tag currently , i was planning on raising in standup in 5 mins
it is the typical movies that boys watch between 7-10 years of age : )
it was able to run 'install ' but not 'try ' ? very weird
ta
it seems to be sporadic
should be able to connect to windows shares just fine from ubuntu . most likely what your router is using
what i stated was a complete sentence , it explains how to do it .
i did set the bootstrap-host to the bootstrap 's eth1 static ip before bootstrapping
and we can ( and should ) ask that question , especially within ubuntu
well on ubuntu you are pretty safe default , more then daily updates are not requiered
sdb2 has the efi files , so it is not hd3 we want here

check your mtus .

i believe minecraft works on linux too : )

i can also sponsor

the auto resize option is checked . the fullscreen option does not change the resolution and seamless mode is greyed
and that will work after i login or effective immediately
in what context ? where are you seeing that name ?
i have one that i added to fstab , and , my lines dont look like that
ok try to install nvidia-prime
because that would indicate we are trying to fetch resources directly
how are you ?
fstab is a config file .
also keep in mind radio frequency is just another kind of electromagnetic wave and it 's not blocked by everything
we need changed to unity-greeter ?
yeah , i imagine that you did n't escape from the general hot weather around ; )

otherwise , systemd and i-s-h look fine , now slogging through the upstart diff .
no one is trying to change your mind . your os is not supported here .
weird fluctuation of behavior
maybe it is best to replace the drive now i backup 'd all data , the drive has over 36000
do you know where installed ?
sure
: p
rolling , please .
would like the high amount of cores in one computer to let go or erlang applications scale out a bit
kk , approved
well , im using ubuntu . maybe its something that i forgot to do
i dont , but its worth a try just to test
so i 'd better use gparted to erase everything ? it 's not a problem there is only a previous
no , i guess it 's part of the whole it engineering field : p
what things will break ?
the reason i ask is because i become skeptical of failures in tests when i see mixed with them failures
did you ask a question yet ?
yes . but thaht doesnt make rdp broadcast . : )
not ubuntu support
hdmi/displayport - built-in audio
oh , i see ! that makes sense that it would n't be included by default then , if it
so you put kf5 5.7 into kubuntu-ppa/next ( or kubuntu-ppa/next-backports ) ?
usually those are hosted on a different domain/server especially if you only have a single server instance for the domain
jhutchins is right , i only gave this info hoping it would be all you need .
that said ... it *is* our devel release
thats a services framework template , and it pip installs .
just turned off compositing at startup and pressed alt+shift+f12 to disable compositing now .
: )
but more important : do you think i would not have these kind of issues with ubuntu server lts ?
should i continue normal boot of go to root shell and do the rest of resizing ?
huh ?
yeah , you have to fake the ua
no . in common sense , that is true
so i guess it has to do with my connected usb drive ?
more than unneeded , its not related
so what exactly does a .deb contains
i do n't understand what you are asking
yes . if you install the metapackage ubuntu-sdk , you should have gotten all of this stuff
i 'd have no clue as to what to look for or what specific file to starting searching
yes
there 's a workaround but we 'll try and figure out a long-term fix
then do it .
i am in ubuntu , only in the live usb . .not on the actual install

juju has n't been python for a few years now
yes it 's shows like ifconfig

sure , and nothing about xubuntu/thunar is preventing dropbox from providing that for you
can you access the machine any other way at the moment ?
yes , let me quickly double check , its not documented in meta/security.md ( yet ) - needs fixing :
no ; the drivers are firmware drivers , so for example the system may have a special adapter plugged into
ah , 16 kb is pretty small
i ca n't get it to show a list , is it possible ?
nevermind
java < 3 by apt is installed in /usr/lib/jvm/java ... . but i want it in /opt
can you rollback the updates you applied from that ppa since you suggested that 's the cause of your games
ah , that 'd be why , yeah , sadly that wo n't work until proper systemd support lands
thing is , even that might not really help , because the stuttering could be due to something completely different
yeah , it 's an array , configflags , those will get passed to cmake
perhaps
are you saying they show in fdisk but not in the file manager ?
i 'd just start with apt-get install nvidia- ... whatever and see what happens . probably it 'll just intsall

it is not , but we are discussing what is happening for lxqt : )
i dont have a /var/lib/lightdm
no i 've failed to talk about docs , it 's on my todo
3.13 ( or , rather , the master branch , which is 3.13 in trusty ) provides the one true
sure
are you one ?
you should , if enumerate = true is set in sssd.conf .. but the tutorial showes you that it slows
best to run such commands in the status window .
running systemd as pid1 ?
i can have a look in 1hour or so
one more question i wanted to ask you about your stopwatch code : what 's the magic of using ``
makes sense - if it only looked at the *last* message it may miss the $ $ merge $ $
that 's why i was asking here
and yes , clamav : - )
i like the sound of tarsnap
yes
logged in as root ? ? ?
make sure as soee_ says that nvisia-prime is installed , if not install it , then install the proprietary driver
has blue systems contacted canonical about this ?
i did n't find such a folder . so i should create it ?
and next time i embark on a refactor , remind me to do the same : )
their own place to go where ?
speaking debian now eh ! tut tut ; )
i need line spacing in hexchat
this is what i usually do , wondering if there is a better way : )
i 'm pretty sure that `` work fine '' is still not what i would excpect .
one is enough : d
so i would copy the blank database from a fresh install
oh , feck , it 's not even that
you can get source for any package just by enabling that in your sources list
come on , please compare the bq e4.5 , for exp . , with the rasperry pi ...
will that work on vivid+overlay too ?
the qa team was busy doing other things these days
grr , more brain pain : `` sudo /etc/init.d/cryptdisks start '' and check again to ensure it was the script
systemd-fsckd was running ?
just any go app ? oof
clean , downgrade is not possible
so you think i should dl xub 1204 and try ?
so relation-set does read yaml from a file
ah , well i am converting those buttons into actionbuttons ( currently they are basically a qml rectangle ) which
no , we should find the corresponding package and assign it to that
pfm
if you run `` rfkill list '' in a terminal , does it say anything about bluetooth being blocked ?
that seems like a good ide
hi there ... what kind of project is it ( qmlproject , cmake , qmake ) ?
the kernel is at least 20 years old now ? i 'll wait till systemd matures before coming back
yes copy true ssh is possible
you might be more effective using one of the autotools/cmake/python-project/etc . types to build your package .
or just change the code that looks at ksm_enabled to look at ksm_enabled or ksm_enabled_in_vm as appopriate
i have a debian on s390 to check
bios checks should be in your post options
we have a lot more slides to cover in the slideshow too
it is an option of course that we do n't deal with the z-value at all in the header ,
sudo lshw -c video
did you run the tests against live ec2 ?
nevermind , press ctrl+c
k , thought you were talking about something else .
just the front is there
yeah which would be with two big advantages : trust only relies on local components ( even closed firmware )
bekks the annoying thing is that i have done this so many times without a problem but this time i
i would think pretty carefully before turning it into a performance reference
me too !
uname is n't telling me
what happens if you just remove them ?
i updated yesterday to vivid , so maybe my phablet-tools-citrain is not the correct one
but the reality is nearly everyone is using devel now
right , if there 's a good reason for the _ that 's ok. just something to consider when using
init-scripts and upstart lived together for a while , then came systemd
backups cant recovery my gpt tables
no , they are n't the same . you 're the only one causing any confusion here .
sorry your message was a bit undecipherable at first , i 'm parsing it correctly now : )
now beta
whats teh stacktrace ?
gaoji sprint
of all the -- - ____ **** etc . chars you could have picked you got the wrong one :
what prints that ^ , a jenkins job ?
or even easier -- shutil.copyfileobj ( ) : )
you can login on tty1 to check - with ctrl+alt+f1
uhoh
switching to systemd flushed quite a few of those out - if fails faster
also maybe lsof .
also it 's //ip - double slash
remember to wash your clothes at six
i was thinking of xrender , not xrandr which is a diiferent setting altogether
your box is still in garantuee ?
it 's got an upstart job that you can restart
insight on flocculant 's question ?
you can speak english here and get help
i also tried sudo aptitude install qtcreator
the problem is athat i am not always swithing from a minimized window to show using compiz ...
syncs and mps are totally incompatible within the same silo
so jhodapp is the one who hocks all the bits together for multimedia
what is that ? smoke signals ? !
open a bug and we can get it fixed in 14.04 images .
why not a normal rw dvd ? : -p
looks like
i guess i 'm a little confused by apache2 and virtual websesrvers
sound ok ?
yeh it will need blacklisting
the combobox only contains `` custom executable '' nothing else ?
works for me
ah more to go to : ) adding ...
: d
unable to locate packet
i do n't get it
on it !
yeah , that 's near the top of my list : )
works for me , whats the best way ? just append the new merge to line # 17 ?
the problem really lies in the complexity of the architecture
no idea , the systems are quite new i7-4790 cpu ... could be uefi
packages are expected to do that ; i. e. that sounds like a bug in that .service , or in
i had similar problem in one of my pc
yes seriously
yeah
last i tried , lubuntu was 706 mb .
not talking about the juju networking api
yep .
executes totally normally if i do it manually , and update-rc.d daemon defaults
correct
i 'm a fan of xfce , installing from xubuntu media is the best way - modifying a unity install
is there any other option ?
if i opened a terminal right now and ran the script it would run with 0 errors
i ran the command
404 here , do better
xrandr -q
your fine , your in the right place for help . ; )
there si a schema file in the snapcraft source that is supposed to be turned into a proper doc
hmm it should have happened in the staging script let me check
kapows
i dont have a spare phone
can you drop mh then & take oxide as is
running tests now
yes
that should be fixed ?
^ what he said
yeah , so our criteria for winner should be `` top non-team tester who has n't won yet ? ''
could you add details like the architecture , and how you got the image ?
maybe in daily live image of ubuntu ?
please do n't include changes to .pc/ or to the upstream files
when are you in the ubuntu-kernel room usually ?
so anyways from a quality and xubuntu perspective both.. who best to talk to about xubuntu having a session at
this a laptop yes ?
oh , so this does n't happen if you have other things ? that 's odd : /
if so could you stop as i 'll be training tjaalton later today .
well if you install fail2ban , you will be able to see all the attempts daily
something like this may be good for master , but for 1.25 if it 's at all possible to restore
thats no drama : )
i 'm having problems with silo 4
and the former case there is `` brace for possible outage '' mixed with some mitigation , depending on how
from the last chating with you
the code where ?
# # chat
well thats why i cant find it lol
any linux should work simply by copying it to totally different hardware , with only a few exceptions ... like
sure , nw
`` dmesg | tail '' suggest anything more detailed about what 's wrong ?
i 'll clean my build and try again too
the broken bit here is webdm
ah , i was n't expecting that behaviour
it says that the package is at the latest version
the problem we 're facing is running tests
well , i got ta go but try google 120hz ubuntu 14.10 .
yeah , welcome to using amd with ubuntu
ah
would you mind phrasing that one again in english ?
it 's now cpu-power=0 which has no effect
we are : - )
o/ : - )
the partition belongs to a brand new installed window 8.1
then , you will get , as i said , the default setup , which will give you the anchor
sure we will notice ( after release ) when you rip it out for now
yeah ... no duh ... that might be why people ask about things ... : p
not right now . first command : sync
your username is not opcode90 ...
may i ask what you hope to get with 15.10 ?
that sounds like a good plan
lots of family there , i guess ?
i do n't think the mx4 is available anywhere anymore
hm , i still do n't see anything in the logs which would actually wait for ifup @ eth0..
at least we identified the issue , sorry we could n't fix it
it 's possible that bug then
done : )
windoze 7
you would be the one inputing the password , and trusting the command , for example
yes makes sens for giffgaff to support it
no
for example , you copy the link of a youtube video . does it capture the video ?
and that long dir belogns to schroot , and he removed schroot package before making the backup
seems like fdisk doesnt support that type .
can i get you a patch to apply after , or do you prefer a ppa package ?
if you 're running on an arm board , and you know that extracion is happening every time your app
and we have text strings in the line cache , or none , consistently
conflicts : i do n't get along with this package at all , and probably never will , it 's
i was thinking , maybe a section where members here can give testimonials of why they like ubuntu , or
from time to time i 'm seeing them
how do i flash a wily image on my phone ?
it looks like the firmware claims to support aspm ( active state power management ) but then fails to provide
there did used to be a way to force that , but only because the sorting algo used to be
please try it if you can for more data points , i will do that also
depends on what you used to view it
so can i kill it by killing gpm
i downgraded address-book and friends but contact sync with my google account does n't seem to be working
ok .
can you add touch-l10n to the other bug as well ?
yes
oh , that sounds like good progress ! you are converting the remaining ones in lxc-android-config ?
its all explained step by step
find / -xdev -iname `` < pattern > ''
i agree , but without a time estimation , there is n't a better solution
because now the splash screen shows but is covered by screenshot before it reaches the screen
you do n't `` connect to ssh '' , you use ssh to connect to a server
no it 's not
queue is interesting info , but without a logtail , it 's still a guessing game .
just change the keyboard layout and do n't look at your fingers
go to a music store that sells vinyl and will demo an analog recording , i 'm sure you 'll
try adding boot_delay=50 it will cause all the text output during boot to slow down , maybe you can catch
that is certainly an option , then i 'll have to learn about all those standard libraries i would need
once that works , we can play with network discovery , which is something else altogether
each distro is fine actually , it depends on your pc
it 's possible that system would do better with the -lowlatency kernel , instead of the -generic
like i told before : upstart still can use the old sysvinit scripts .
and change it with update-alternatives -- config as needed
i just read about xcursor.size : in .xresources but it did n't change anything for me
that section on rewriting charms with the framework is gold
are you going to use the documentation i suggested to you ? `` learn c++ the qt way '' ?
my server dont install package requisite
sorry , the way it was used , it sounded like derive was an editor ... . i never know
yeah , i did n't see it either
i thuoght we packaged those ?
you using openssl too ?
bah , sigh ... the change went to the ppa livecd-rootfs because the distro was in final freeze , seems
yes themes require a g-s-d running
there is a solution to this , to do by hash packages et.al . but it 's in experimental apt
it 's on the freenode server
you have to use some scripting language for that ...
restart the cups service perhaps
oh , you mean in the search box , rather than the url i gave ?
it 's necessary for work .
the nvidia ones claim to work on the matrix
no way to built that into the dda somehow ?
number of ways , can we have some context ?
i 've added you to the sdk trello board/card
hmmm , then maybe a combined esata/usb enclosure . i have 2 here that are very useful for that kind
it 's in `` software-properties-common ''
then it should work
baked alaska is still pie
yeah , that was my baseline when i needed to have a look at that . i did n't use
is there any reason why nvidia-settings is still at 346 for precise ? is there a dependency missing or something
so run ssh -vvvv 10.21.21.40 and pastebin the output
so no change needed on our side ?
yes , it would have done it automatically if teh app would run in the background ... . but it
you have some of the best helpers in the channel right now , ask away : )
whats the -- wipe for ?
any other options ?
also lucy which has the worlds weirdest ending
garbage collection ?
ok explain it , i will do it . you mean puppy will be using the same partitions of ubuntu
frameworks
something sounds badly wrong there
potentially
why do n't you just upgrade it then ?
ok old image
mail-notification-evolution is required i guess
you can try to disableit
i was more thinking in addition to .
oh , now i see what you mean
try recovery , update-grub , and maybe remount rw and reinstall grub , or you did something with video driver
hehe that 's possible : )
we need the snap in the store ...
your surrounded by hungry wolves
you can run the beta or rc - i am doing so now
what ? i have a 1080p that does n't horizontally scroll
you can try the proprietary driver
yes , it 's called `` something else '' on the partitioner window . you will have to partition manually
as long as they work ...
to make it simple , lets just say 2 interfaces , `` br1 '' and `` bond0 ''
sure . i 'll stick around too in case you need anything else . : )
have u tried it on cellphone , smartphone ?
on what planet ?
you build your own kernel = your own support
if i understand correctly those debugs should be in unity8 's log , rigiht ?
ok , type exit then reboot see what happens if you get a grub prompt restart and hold shift and
we have a problem with the schemas , the other vibration branch landed in trunk and rtm , but not
has it somethign to do with bash ?
ah , good call ; should be kind of obvious , but explicit is better

is the user as whom your launchpadlib is authenticated a member of ~admins ?
i 'm having a *really* slow download from maas.ubuntu.com for sstreams-mirror - is this the same for you as well
i do n't like the phrase `` 2 trunks '' : )
ok , back . my desktop moved to another monitor , but that 's yet another issue
will mention it in the landing e-mail if we wo n't unblock rc-proposed
just make sure that the file system is un-mounted
`` sudo apt-get install wine1.6 ''
k , so not only me
that 's logic that is duplicating what the real apiclient would be doing
will you land it soon ?
emmm.. technically yes , because they host them on youtube , you need just to know the links then download
no gui ? : -d

anytime , happy to help
because your kernel is out of date and when i asked you to run `` cat /etc/issue '' you came
awesome : d
so it 's not a surprise to anybody , or that we ca n't be blamed for skewing the results
you dont . adobe stopped making a linux flash player . use pepperflash-nonfree
lol
what 's up with the critical bug ?
lol
cool , do i install it using apt ?
interested in the results
sambapwdlastset is specific to the samba3-openldap schema , i have no idea what the equivalent is in a samba4 world
type apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop and it should say
which link ?
what is the problem , you say slow internet , `` break system '' could you be more specific ?
that 's okay . i will keep on using xchat then . it seems like a great program .
no change when you set it in the amd conrtl settings thingy ? catalyst or what its called ?
udo e2fsck -f /dev/mapper/fedora-root

exactly

if we install from your ppa , does it automatically get the right version of autopkgtest ?
when i initially wrote the back end i put in the globalkey stuff to use with annotations

aiui networks are created when you add a ngi

did you check additional drivers section ?
try doing it manually from a terminal : `` syndaemon -i 1 -k -d
to get any other intel audio drivers , you would have to get them from intel

that 's good
that is not related to the desktop you use
keepass ( x|2 ) , pass
hm , right .
ah jees ... for the same reason i could n't do the backport , this is going to be hard
true i suppose i have n't tried : )

maybe you can plug the speakers in the monitor ?
android as a flakey windows going wrong as time goes on : >

why do you want those partitions anyway ?

what about the priority ? should glib be bumped to 1600 or something ?
then place it there maybe
e : no money
i tried that already too , here 's the new output which is the same as the old output
i am at phone safe distance
yep
np , a fix for this should land soon , it was a problem with nm
not you : )
i added the `` provide my own bzr bd'ed debs '' since this did something weird with my system (
ok , this seems to be going mir-direction
no . go to # ubuntu-es
'id system `` tiger '' ' , what is that ?
iirc there 's a copy-package tool in some kind of archive-tools repo though
well to test the charm do you need it in the store ?
/var/log/syslog or /var/log/kern.log . also try 'dmesg ' in a console for some hints .
ok in the terminal/vt run sudo apt update & & sudo apt upgrade , then you 'll see some packages
hi..we ( myself and stuart ) are intending ucs to be more like npm , pip etc where installing something

mint is not supported here
yes i tihnk so
is it possible it 's just not configured ? does /sbin/ifconfig -a show it ?
that is your problem , read only mount i believe if you get there generally .

could you point the interesting people to # oxide on freenode , or the oxide @ lists.launchpad.net ml ?
sometimes people use ( lp : # number , lp : # number2 )
yeah . not happening . mutter doesn ; t do that . compiz ( unity ) and muffin ( cinnamon

no that is not needed , can you type the exact syntax you used with dd ?
it 's an image i had to build after i built the mako re-spin

yes , its a pain normally
so the big one is making subordinates specific to units , not to machines

that 's the one .

why ? we can maintain that .
sounds good to me

no

yeah , but last time i installed default ubuntu took me like 10 minutes to actually get to a package

sometimes it is the wifi ( or 3g network ) that causes trouble , because the wifi ap might emit

no problem

well if you have devel mode enabled , you can switch with ubuntu-device-flash . but do n't use -- wipe
you 're correct , the apps do rotate , i just did n't do enough testing i guess .
yeah , filtering through all the updates for the next wishlist/status is going to be a real pain ; )
after that : `` cd /etc/alternatives '' then `` sudo update-alternatives -- set *-gnu_egl_conf /usr/lib/*/mesa-egl/ld.so.conf '' and last : ``

they 're versioned , yes , but no one checks their contents as it would be crazy , i would

probably easiest with three lines of python -- iterate over status `` fail '' and `` kde '' in package
okay .
*lol*
normally those tests just pass silently
yes , if executables were corrupted but it should be detected via the file hashes
i chose `` try ubuntu ``
it 's not that we do n't believe you . it 's that nobody cares .

try /var/lib/cloud/seed/ec2/user-data and /var/lib/cloud/seed/ec2/meta-data , maybe .
so this is a rough guide that you should do further research from until you are happy with the process
e.g . , mkdir -p ~/canonical/snappy/src/launchpad.net & & cd ~/canonical/snappy/src/launchpad.net & & bzr branch lp : snappy & & cd
ah sweet cheers will bookmark : - )
ask asus then .
do you have any idea about bug 1332931
yeah , i found that bug when i googled the error : - )
b/c it retries
if you go with my suggestion then everybody should be happy because it can handle any combination in one bulk
then it a server , the server you tried before is so poor
website ? tar the docroot then scp it home
this will only be used on my localhost , so security is n't a really big deal .
meaning , what , in terms of having ?
but yeah , you were using remove -- purge which is a bit pants
ca n't help you - you seem unable/unwilling to describe the problem clearly
yes , wine is a translation layer
assuming all plugins are in trunk
annoying so it even knows it 's at 10.04.04 `` current ''

great ! what is the hotfix hot fixing ?
because if not you could auto-generate the password via ssh after the install is done
when you boot what happens ?
leaving in ~ 30 minutes
make sure it 's the only one running , and that sudo service network-manager status gives you good stuff back
yes , i already replaced my codebase
it should default to 1
weird
also , as ref counting lands , we should not change the space of a subnet with refcount > 0
100 %
wrong channel , join # debian .. this is ubuntu support .
it does whatever it is intended to do

the one advantage you 'll find with newer versions is the latest package versions .

i do n't have that one for some reason ...
oh ! my typo ! `` sudo cryptsetup isluks /dev/sdc9 '' ( not the upper-case l ) !
if it does n't work you could just boot it and write the windows mbr again

i am snapping one of the examples - shout . send code or not needed ?
i run a self test from the disk utility and it found no errors ...

use something else in the partitioning menu and create the partitions , and then boot the live usb when it
update that key , give it another go and let me know if you run into the same behavior
ok sorry , you clearly do n't know the basics . you need a nat setup in place to translate
obviously , keep an account logged in so you can manage the server if you screw up the config

is it possible for me to add something after , if i want ?
which one would you recommend ?
you asked how . i explained both options

that 's what i 'm fixing now
so it is ready for tests ? : )
in # ubuntu-cn

yes , maybe .

the other thing

i wanted to test it maybe , is that in a silo ?
definitely
i 'll get a response when 15.04 is out : )
but there are limits
right , we could do that , but we 'd undo it all and put it on to launchpad in
if grub seems to try to load vmlinux but then you get returned to the grub menu without the system

then there is something wrong with your file manager , it should automatically update - nautilus at least .
my brain is a bit melted ... i would say it was related to the sanity tests ...

are you confusing me for someone else ?
ok - taking a look now
what language is it in ? since i worked with ruby i 've used jekyll .

you can suggest a rain dance and it will work , because it also work without a rain dance .
strange
i meant the `` su yourusername '' command that was giving you the `` run from a terminal '' error
yeah , that sounds good to me . it 's a good start at least . if we get user
it always breaks during install for me : \
sounds like driver issues
but anyway i *think* that runhook.execute is the only thing that needs to know whether status-set was called

yes
not really as the information gets split in to locations to search for

if you can copy the text its best to use a pasteservice
great , can you comment on the bug ?
inside the space commands i wanted to differentiate between `` not supported '' and other api errors
build failed : does not match [ 'fixes-1513552 ' ] is not clear enough ?
yeah . dolphin is the best i guess . so handful
that is , please run that command from the same machine where `` apt-get update '' is failing .
but if .10 is working then we should be ok , is that right ? sergiusens ?
aptdaemon/armhf failure will go to pass in next britney run , fyi

you are using the sdk right ?
have you wayland working yet ?
wgolden : tp-link tl-wn725n
is it normal not to have any devices listed in 'input ' while on the sound control settings ?
ubuntu uses apparmor
daftykins seen him quote you for solving an issue
we have it online via ethernet if that helps
is the bug against the website , or the event itself ?
i mean with this specific warning
ooo
i mean creating the dual boot after an ubuntu install
maybe the bluez reinstall will fix the mouse ?
it 's not the password - it 's the key pair
?
you typed # hardware , the channel is # # hardware
i tried this without sucess
because i only change simple script and all vhost and all my cluster server respond 500 : )

yes

need the entire folder ?
i also changed all the other tests except teh failing to to `` def xtest_ '' to disable them ,
nant done
if you are not seeing grub tap the shift key as you power on .

well i 'm officially a ci person this week , so do n't mind me : d
no i havent checked the openvpn logs , i guess i should have done that xd
i only delayed because it got worse since before mir 0.17
i have 2000 , because i have not figured out how to supress the ci messages .
why not ?
great
i 'll take a look tomorrow - but yes , we can do a bump to the store - i
good luck . hope it gets approved

if you needed a cpu driver , you would not have booted : )

that worked for me .

yes

ok , np

is it a big problem downloading new version in this way ?
it 's yours to do .
do you need it ?

wow : ) good to know
the removeitems ( ) thing ( breaking multiselect delete ) ... and the trackclicked issue when selecting the same index

yes - the stuff on the right side of his default desktop
i my system does n't have a dvd drive . i could try the ole mounted usb trick .
im sure the store has something free like that
i have many versions available like 340 , 352 , 355 , 358 and i tried them
uh , what kind of badness ?
sorry , which package ?
exactly my conundrum

the thing that worries me the most now that its like that is that they could easily see the db

why ?
also , each time the app is activated
could be a broken network mount ?
have you tried using html5 options ?
there are options to see the differences and what it would do . always inspect first before choosing .
indeed you are right
exploring any option , including edits to the image , to see if there 's some way to verify that

what you think ?
yes , thats what the backend does ... your prob will be that there is more to it

try create a new user and login from there , see if it goes faster
and you point the installer to the /dev/mapper/ $ vg- $ lv nodes
indeed : )
you mean just the letter m or that fancy sign ?
yes i can enable dev mode and set the password that way , but that makes the wizard not come
i do n't understand
and through the loader of previewwidgetfactory too
yeah : ) ... i know i worked on it because i submitted patches for a bug with the boot.img
can you nag someone ?
how so ?
use __jfdi__ to land that
that 's a win sshot yes
right which hits the router but not the box behind it right
for multiple files ?
got your point..
what about qtcreator-plugin-ubuntu ?
try simpler tools , e.g . apt-get install mail-server^ or install the specific mail server that you want

so ni ye should shuo chinese
none of that is true

yes , i plan on raising this with curtis tomorrow

it 's not mobility
yeah , let 's summarize
yes , the fix is in your branch too . i do n't understand , but your branch looks good
seems reasonable
just ignore it .
lovely
how are you configuring your network connection ?
yes
output of the former command is : package : unity-greeter
sync images directly from pending , the *fix* will probably take a moment

depends on your experience though js or vala would be best for gnome app

check that the hdd is first in the boot order , and if it says uefi somewhere make sure it
not many . i saw a guy mention it on the ubuntu g+ community , but i dont think people
you asked for a quick fix and i provided one in like less than an hour ... .
a quick guess is
ok it 's dual now
i see . seems weird it is a factor then ...
my first guess is that you are using google startpage in firefox anyway lol
that 's not very friendly of the installer !
do you use the hud at all in unity ?
that 's when the wear levelling reaches its limit
what 's in ~/.ssh on machine1 ?
is your reboot issue new ?
ah ok , missed that
clean install will save you a headache : p
can i try deleting the broadcom driver , would that solve the problem ?
well , it does , we do n't have overlay scroll thumbs anymore , right ?
the channel is edge
resolves but nothing comes back
to see what is installes

if you dont have stuff running who needs opengl , then its not installed . if you have stuff running

i just sent you a msg
bekks i have tried disabling plymouth , disabling acpi , disabling `` quiet splash '' and using `` text ''
i did it on purpose
actually since it 's a new install it would be easier to just reinstall in legacy mode
just run the script on the remote branch
do the lvs have nodes in the device-mapper ( /dev/mapper/ ) ?
sorry i meant to take to kinosuke
also look into if you can use a mutex lock in the web server 's programming langauge
you could test out distro 's in virtualbox also
we 'll get there , one day
if you wanted something immediate you could create a branch that has colemak debs , but i ca n't guarantee
but we 'll need the four machines ?
try htop
it could also be to do with an interaction between the unreleased version of unity8 and the uitk staging code
cd is fine
it 's probably caused by hangouts
to keep in mind sudo apt-get autoremove -- purge [ package ] will autoremove dependencies of the package together with

i evilly turned off my hook a while back and have yet to reenable it
ah , it was because the comments were unsaved .
do you see anything interesting when running `` dmesg '' ? like failing to load firmware etc
yes , it does : )
i 'll get that merged today
edit the custom script we made , change `` ./uplink-bin '' to `` ./uplink ''
that 's ... curious , given that you had solid tests on the previous image .
if you see some weird errors/bugs ping me please : )
jk
but it only lists jamesh , who is not an ubuntu dev ; so either the train did n't properly

haha
you might be able to apt-get -f install , then ctrl+c while it 's doing stuff , but you 'd
i guess we could do that as a last resort , but i would rather prefer doing all the troublesome
i wonder if the issue is n't that one but rather than cmake pkgconfig should n't handle the case for
so anyway i started looking at what we actually did with that interface and that led me to the naked
on your page man
i see the scary config in /etc/fw_env.config
we have *three* init systems to work with : ) ... you sure ? 15.10 means systemd then

sounds nice - a looong weekend : )

the drive is obviously working in that you 're getting the shutdown message from the live image .
sorry , accidentally closed my client
this is why people become managers
did you google it to see if 14 or 15 will support 3tb drives ?
i do n't think location bias is one that can be fixed easily .
ok , pushing python-keystoneclient 1.2.0-0ubuntu1.2~cloud0 + python-neutronclient 2.3.11-0ubuntu1.2~cloud0 from proposed to updates in kilo uca

ah - ok
i 'm running a wily-proposed desktop , so at least there are no more transitions
hah , bah
i 'm not done answering it .
you can try scan with clamav also to be sure , its database ir very up to date with linux
i cd 'd to the file and then did ./install.sh and nothing happened .
nice -- could you help me with that ?
zbenjamin : ok , i 'll work on it then

then default might be already on ahci
well , you 're restricting your options with mint in that case
then is system settings > startup & shutdown > sessiom management > applications to be excluded . type the app
you can attacha file there
the service command is being used to smooth the transition as it works with both .
ok now `` cd /media/ubuntu/7cc0110f-fac1-4d67-8e48-9aae6ed30906/home/ ''
it 's in the current rc-proposed builds . i remember davmor2 telling me he was +1
: )
i 've found the bug , and that 's a gui bug
ah
the assert does see the result of earlier txn.op in the same transaction does n't it ...
uh
it is nothing to do with this channel
libreoffice
even harder than no network , hmmmm , or ... *justkidding*
it is , that 's the thing
so see the answers you already got .
try using gigolo
was it duplicated before and you edited it out of the request ? i 'm not aware of anything that
would rather not risk that on a work laptop if i do n't have to . i 'm not going
you could try a 14.04 over it perhaps ?
in the italian channel they suggested me a guide to follow ... where it 's written to do : dpkg-reconfigure
i 'm installing the silo atm , to give it another try
which inherited from turbo pascal , yeah , which inherited from wordstar
and i had plans never touch anything to do with time manipulation before : p

i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
is this happening with firefox full-screen , or windowed , or both ?
you have problems with a ctrl keybind
as far as i can see , there are no very big differences .
laney is on swap today
i hate unity
and i 'll see if someone from the autopilot team can look at it .
well we suggest you update your ubuntu version to the 14.04.3 lts .
blame on me i am so sry
the second syntax is the legacy one , e.g . bundle : mediawiki/single
sorry about that ; i really appreciate that you are working on this : )
buildbot had spuriously failed .
i ca n't access that link from this machine , unfortunately .
says who ?
works for me
and ?
huh , i remember there was a convinient button in the past , did robru say why it 's gone
1:7.3.0-1ubuntu3.1
was it not at the bottom of the screen in the partitioning summary ?
i uploaded libpeas yesterday , thats at 1.16 noww
just get more
good to figure as much out yourself as you can , but just ask for more direct hints
this is why i was hoping that someone had done this and documented it : )
grub is n't right . i have to pick ubuntu recovery and then pick a version to boot
but you were right
ok
just a heads up , we 'll need another gtk upload this week . mclasen has n't made up his
so the sequence is , generate the pairs , test them throughly , make backups , encrypt them , save
burning 14.04 now
just use patchvalue for the strategies
they seem to be empty svg files
no problem , i was just curious : )
on linux you can always get more raw : )
is that my branch ?
that sounds nicer than a queue of events in the state server
maybe i have to recreate a symlink ?
on it
if it technically start , s but starts and shuts down when called via systemd you 'll find it will
hmm , i ca n't make sudo reboot go bang
then type sudo chmod 755 /etc/grub.d/01_enable_vga.conf
i see .
it 's probably / possibly because we 're both using the account

nw , ty
if you pull that into sid , we 'll just sync it back to w-series and kill the ubuntu fork
that 's a windows phone . i 'll bet it 's using mtp . what version of ubuntu are you
why are you so attracted to minimal install , are you on an older pc or some such ?
it 's not just about tweaking a request or response , it 's about faking a sequence of calls ,
yw
can you paste the error you get about gmake ?
if really i want install aceproxy , if explane then `` sudo apt-get install python-gevent python-psutil git vlc ''
so i 'll work on filing bugs to direct what i 'm after
use gparted from a livecd .
u-s-c and qtmir should now get 'pass ' results
i choose the password ?
: - ) awesomeness . will you build a click tomorrow then after ?
well then sure - another url can not hurt : p
wrong
if you want ubuntu then use ubuntu : ) we dont know what the backbox guys changed there . so
are you trolling ? you said you installed teamspeak client already and cant connect . now you say you dont
i 'm looking , brb .
would there be any kind of unstability in the system if i go for changing the desk env ?
i know who 's doing it
if i were you i 'd purge the ppa too
sil2100 : i 'm rebuilding the silo , as it takes some time
well you 'll need the admin pass for that : d
i cant get in how can i check this file
i see , i was trying to figure out to fix my wifi lan , that is switched off in
what ?
`` install '' sounds like a call to action and users ca n't click on the images
or use krunner , alt+f2 , type systemsetings
we had an idea to investigate on having a recovery ( similar to what we have for phones ) ,
remove ~/.mozilla/firefox/ and restart firefox and try again ?
write a script that upon login adds the resolution mode and sets it ; )
you need conv=fdatasync to actually write each block to disk
are you redoing from scratch ?
wich driver version in use mate ?
i ca n't see any crashes with staging in ubuntu-clock-app
sorry about that , done now ( no change for n-ovs )
there 's a 'nounix ' option but not a 'unix ' mount option
eh ? the nexus 4 is an officially supported device on ! devices : )
there is no `` but '' s
which rest ?
do you have a bugtracker link handy ?
so i 'm happy to see your suggestion to allow people in a group to edit the files ; that
exactly : (
yeah , uenv.txt is currently needed , my branch fixes that ( or will )
lines 443-448 show your wlan0 ( wireless ) connected
hey
have you tried ubuntu live cd and then use boot-repair ?
hmm you are right
because those actions are also active
: - )
do you have the right commit hash handy ?
even if you port it something might break
no , just a partial for 1.24 and master
via apt ?
is he the `` html '' guy ? haha !
yep : )
yes .
were you here yesterday ?
nah `` sudo apt-get purge package1 package2 package3 ... '' manually type them in
firewall is ok
i 'm consistent
you probably want /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/qml/ ?
did libubuntu-download-manager-client-doc get updated with the new content ?
the good news is that you will be able to play dota if you do this . the bad news
btw , re : that python3 bug above , dh-python does rewrite shebangs , but only /usr/bin/python ones , not
no
yes . will you take care of that bug report we talked about earlier , the apparmor mess one ?
that 's a novel use-case , are the connection attempts being logged in the host 's samba logs ?
alt+f2 - > type `` keyboard ''
although it would be kinda nice if $ gopath/pkg was specific to the version too
true , but it 's up at a level now where people can look into it , but you may
indeed , save that syslog text to your pc also if wifi shutsdown : p and you can do same
ip is shorter to type and he knows what we mean
ok
let 's start with this facelift .
from where
yes , that was the main difference - i was aware as i also build the nvidia package in arch
i was under the impression that you can not combine persistant with toram ?
gon na b for tomorrow mate
but have you already installed the silo ?
rvr , davmor2 , mirv : will build a new image once those build
ah cool . a just need lp : ~mterry/qtmir/no-touch-no-lifecycle and its dependencies , right ?
it would be a libtool-bin | xxx type thing
ctrl+c then try starting it with that option
would n't hurt to pull the mains power supply cable and let it sit for a few mins , then
hold , i have that change in my local machine : | wtf did happen there , sending a fix
that 's exactly what i wanted !
probaly nano
tarmac by default just talks if something goes wrong .
it is open source radeon driver
it is in no condition
screen blank ?
try sudo umount -l
what bugs ?
do you have an alarm set for the morning ? can you give the output of grep `` nov 24
yeah , that might be reasonable
so , nvidia-current ?
okay , then where am i supposed to get the xubuntu livecd ?
type that in a terminal
yes you can
i 'll double check the 14.04.1 release then
can you explain ?
mysql-benchmark/2 is provisioned iops , mysql-benchmark/0 is ssd , mysql-benchmark/1 is magnetic
if you 're confident with that , okay . i would just like to point out that it 's trivial
reviewed
what point are you at now ?
heh ; was thinking more a layer above `` device '' as in the product/box
i was thinking about it
yea i was ignoring those
i was referring to an earlier comment
nixos is the name of an operating system , like ubuntu also is .
do they use kde ?
not really , other than if you 're sure it is a ppa cinnamon , contact them is our standard
the frameworks are available both from the sdk and on the device
i 'll try that : d
we do not support backbox here , sorry
the first problem is the lack of any ppc64el kit on which to investigate .
is the root file-system an lv in the lvm vg ?
sweet !
i will reboot and come again
it 's likely .
in the charmstore , that code is in the storetesting package
no
i 'm reviewing your branch , but something more urgent came up
it 's trivial to do . we should obviously think about when they would be run and how they would
hmmm
even at google they teach their employees . `` do n't bother remembering this . just learn how to find

i managed to break bash , unity , emacs and dbus with just a few edits in the wrong places
can you type ls -ld . * | nc termbin.com 9999 ( if there 's nothing instrusive ) ?
i have a cunning plan give me 5
yeah that should do it , by why that instead of using a deny ?
hey , not your fault at all .
it does not produce any output ?
what does lsblk have to say ?
oh , and yeah : xenial
i ran it without sudo and terminal still gives me the same four error messages .
jenkins apparently dropped runs 1-20 already
comments and variable/function names
the * has nothing to do with it
i am pretty sure you would be waaay more freaked if i had produced your pwd
well by line i mean using the pencil or pen tool
excellent . looks good to me , then .
if you 're using dhcp then your /etc/resolv.conf is probably written by your dhcp client , so be aware that
^ that 's what i 'm currently running
sorry , i was afk
add those releases to your sources and give it a low priority .
mountall is responsible for mounting file-systems in the correct order , and running fsck on file-systems . i said earlier
on both signal issues , or just up ?
it would be a lot easier to test that we have n't screwed it up if it was n't a

what ubuntu is it ? do you have ppas enabled ?
you realize that without the about page there is no way to enable developer mode so no way to use
here is usually my `` checklist '' if you will . mount the vbox media again and manually run the
what are you doing ?
which desktop ? which ubuntu ?
the sign of a successful execution in *nix is no output : )
not if you have lots of unused space
that opens the store ...
i was telling gurudev
i never had persistent journal , but can try enabling that
so i got another one for you..
when you have e.g . func ( a *api ) method ( ) error { } defined on the facade
are you a developer ?
correct

we use jenkins for automatically running all of our tests in our projects , so that we can check that
we already landed things on vivid
you can choose between long time support or non-lts
ah good stuff , from there check if you 're online with something like `` ping google.com ''
ask your ubuntu question
where did you go ?
oh well : )
that means the target would be erased ?
let me reinstall
it was a better time ...
i ran the last command from putty
if your 'modinfo e1000e ' does n't show an alias covering 1f05 then you need a newer kernel .
well i 'm kind of going to assume that someone is using ubuntu : )
should i check all rdepends or did you already ?
also , lgtm
it depends on the command , usually -ppassword
is that a bad thing ?
its running a php and apache server , a media server , and a few separate programs
yes
for example , selecting time ranges is largely implemented on the server side but needs client side support
so just do the follows in a terminal window :
where are you getting that error ?
what is causing the upload problem ( permissions ) ?
either it 's dead , has a write protect tab on , or it needs mounting in another way
that conditional continue is a result of the if test on the previous line , which calls the function ``

no file/directory s/bot-coexist/bt-coexist
everything worked and it booted fine , however . grub was on the actual ubuntu drive
i did that
you can have a persistent partition casper-rw as big as you want .
it is a security flaw ... at least , ensure your home wifi is n't in there ; )
ok so systemd is used like in 14.04 then . thx
not tried
since lxc-android-config is the only thing you wanted to sync , right ?
otherwise it uses deprecated apis
coolio will do now
`` try '' it where ?
why do n't you have ssh access ? just install it in the live session
congrats on the membership , now we have to wait for someone from the ircc to confirm
for that reason you have to copy theme with rythmobox
beats me but that 's what it does
either way , to update it run sudo apt update & & sudo apt -y dist-upgrade

you 've already got your data backed up ?
so any news about the maliit mir patches ?
i 've experienced it on 2 systems and it 's well discussed in the ubuntu emulation forums .
yeah right..
yep : )
just different default packages
at least partly . i could watch tv in the frontend , but voice did not work ,
well , you might find one here
nope , second condition does n't work . it 's 18:53 , an alarm set to 17:55 should rings tomorrow
i was wondering if it could be related to the kde ppa but i see k3b is n't from there
does the deployer bootstrap for you ?
sadly i am not the first to come up with the concept of paid support requests : )
same with alarms
you are . there 's a link to the relevant license somewhere
15.10 is sts , 14.04 is lts , thats the only difference when it comes to `` stability ''
the use case is that we have this snapcraft tool which will call other plugins for a language . but
is it ntfs btw ?
ack
the issue atm is that things we distribute with the os look like part of the os and if they
yeah , all you need is the dns proxied a bit
i do n't think there is a spec as to what to expect from gmail notifications
no core file
do you have a neutron-api branch up for review ?
try sudo apt-get purge freeradius , if that does n't work try sudo apt-get install -- reinstall freeradius , then
could you try refreshing your branch somehow ( to trigger the gh hook again ) ?
i 'm thinking like maybe it 's generating the diff twice , first it makes a wrong contents & wrong
a blog is n't suitable for my articles ; i tried to work with wordpress years ago but it frustrated

give me a minute i 'll look at preseed and whatnot
yes
grrrr ! i thought sddm ran as root ; maybe it runs as sddm
that 's sbuild 's -s option
in any other case , offsetting the content may be painful , and may cause ui hickups , especially if
ok ... let 's roll back . it sounds like these might not always be a direct mapping to cli

i 'm not aware of that . i had an occasional browser crash which disappeared after updating my image ,

what does mdadm report about the state of the raid parts ?
sorry to be annoying , but can you delete the todo ( fwereade ) at the top of uniter.runcommands ?
my maas usually is called maas
can you give me the link to your trello board ?
any number of incompatibilites can show up , especially when the system expects usb2 but is talking to a usb3
versus what ?
what do you think i 'm doing here ?
ok
the trunk folder
4.7 , 4.8 , 4.9 seem to be 'present ' on the computer , and 4.8 is the default in
the rule is simple , if you release , and the header is more than half visible , it will
but you can try the xda forums , check if nobody ported it maybe
every folder in where ?
in any case , why is n't it automatic ?
time to change password in ishouldnottypemypasswordinirc
where do i propose it ?
nm , got it
that confirms it i 'm afraid
what i meant was , are the invisible files in the same direcory as the visible ones ?
do you know any c example ?
once you boot the live usb , type sudo blkid | grep vfat , you 'll get a list of
there 's also metricsmanager which does n't fit the same pattern , and `` diskmanager '' which should be renamed
knice
sure . will you do it or should i ?
bcache-tools accepted , so once that hits the archive you can verify .
sorry for the language
( in /var/crash )
noooo , they are to be used from there
yes but there is no official template
i 'm not exactly sure what you 're up to , but you can find old packages in archive.ubuntu.com/pool ..
sweet ! even better imo
i 'm trying to run a current distro on old , proprietary hardware
there 's always the nuclear option ; delete .all the .hidden files and folders your /home . logout , login
yeah , bzr was saying 'nothing to do. ' but somehow ci train was just puking all over it .
i 'm sorry , i was n't really trying to argue
it 's not perfect , but it 's an order of magnitude better
64 bit
the side bar icons should launch the application .
yes , that sounds good
okay , the name was just confusing since it stated ... amd64- ... .
it appears that i have to have a window open , right now i have xirc
it seems management wanted that
yup , nuntium , and it will sync from proposed ? crazy : - )
yeah , sometimes it said n/a : )
was the system booting in uefi mode ?
ill try to get this branch done in the next few days and put a ppa up
hold up , do n't do that .
sounds like a per-gadget thing ?
what was the problem ? was one missing ?
so this issue is interesting because in the past , all i did was run `` gparted '' on the
ahh , ok , cool . perhaps i should go test that on qastaging or something to test the implemetation
^ : )
yeah , but it 's one step after new , no ?
i am writing some of my photos to it.. i can still see earlier ( some 3 months back written
where do i specify the directory ? could you please give me an example with say desktop directory ?
is that on a nexus 4 ?
we totally do n't do this in launchpad :
do n't you need it to get the machine ?
you do n't edit user 's permissions , you edit file permissions
i meant by your adapting the command i gave you without understanding what it does ! this `` sudo sed
it works pretty reliably for most things , just a few limitations that are annoying
yeah , i 've done that .
rather than dropping the ranges
but that 's a bug with the qt4 themeing which is a ) upstream and b ) unmaintained
ok it asks for the drive
eat you butter
but i have to say on this channel my dislike
ah so if i run both the ubuntu mini.iso and the lubuntu `` command-line system '' in virtualbox i should
grep -rn `` components 0\.1 '' .
hmmm let me check if i can find some where else..
ah , i was wondering about the nick ...
and if i do n't have that , what can i do ?
it resolves correctly
roger that , also have another system with fglrx , no steam but same issue
yeah , exactly , that was where i fucked up
when i am out of a meeting i will find the build script any of us can run locally with
yeah , it 's confusing . before user `` zachary '' could n't access it , but i readded it
where 's sitter ?
ok sorry
do you know why the binary is arch-specific ? istr something about not being able to depend on arch-specific binaries
i just starting standalone service with tons of arguments and global vars
welcome to cardcreator.js world : )
alrighty , do you plan to use just that spare 20gb for ubuntu or to give it some more ?
me . the vms are paused and the nodes are gone . i do n't think jog dismantled the maas
i 'm looking for help , too . when i restart my computer , highlights vanish from writer .
that 's the whole point of lsb . to have a minimal set of things that work the same everywhere
yes , i tried pressing intro , tab , the arrow keys any key in my keyboard , but nothing
i 've just successfully deployed a charm this way and my logging confirms that `` first '' is set correctly
ignore sorry
repeated smaller explosions better than one big one ? i guess so : )
but where
that 's this bug that ralsina is shepherding
or are you using a usb stick
so how did you test ubuntu mate ?
consider something like a provisioner
wait_for /dev/sr0
already done too - i found the bug reported by kalinkiana
i know . same symptoms though . there was some theory about it being systemd related
that 'd be cool . propose a time and i 'll see what i can do with the cat herding
how so ?
if your phone is rooted , you can use an app called drivedroid . that 's the only option i
it would be a weekend , or two
i 'm happy with figuring out how it works , i 'll apply it to mate : ) let 's
are we allowed to post ppa links here ?
340 or 346
can chat now
systemd is n't to blame for passphrase entry . that was present in 14.10 also .
it does n't complain ? or it does and fixes the issue ? and this is all before update/upgrade ,
never heard of them and from past phone experience , most of the `` big players '' in the carrier
thats what i wanted to confirm
i do it for the nic i choose
how ? what boots for you to test ram ?
ok
sorry , had a contractor come by to look at some winter damage
have you done a packet capture ?
since the check is the same - providerid unique when ! = `` ''
i answered that above - the interpreter triggered a .decode ( 'ascii ' ) call
nope .
the one thing that makes me nervous is that we are flattening two dimensions into one
i doubt that . you got the 15.10 kernel there
also9 , so you hav3e something to click on to see how much time is left
let 's check .. ' sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade ; sudo update-grub ' . if all looiks
this will be a task of the next days : )
ok , so no process has a handle to anything in /home.bad/ ... that 's good to know
i would rather not give users access to port 80
libertine
so i should move the patches to charm-helpers and neutron api to the next branches now
all too well .
indeed
did you try additional drivers in the dash ?
dbus ?
that 'll do
what am i looking for ?
jdstrand , wily touch build kicked
i 've never touched the merging stuff , so i have no idea , i 'm afraid . : )
purge removes all settings of the packages installed , meaning not user settings ( the one with dot.package , from
there is also regular coffe you know : p
it put them here : /usr/share/doc/kde/html/en/
trying to finally sort the telepathy-qt5 mess out : )
i will file a bug today to ensure it does n't fall off our radar
yep
how too ?
you are not helping the volunteer support in here by making childish comments , please keep them to yourself or
i915_bpo
^
we should really encapsulate these issues in a mail and hit the list with them so the community has an
thnx . yeah i will increase the mouse area size to make that easier .
yes , the problem is that it does n't allow a user belonging to that group to write a file
oerheks it 's an old model so that 's why i 'm not too convinced it 's a hardware issue
goeie nag
yes it does !
yeah but frankly that is too specific a person as they might be sleeping etc
canonical did a lot of work on wayland and found it to be lacking ( thier opinion )
yeah : )
you 've manually installed it from a deb
hehe i wondered if that was implied : - )
somebody has to do it : -p
and how many times do you boot in a week ?
not much about bind itself , but that setup shuold work fine , so long as the slaves are in
yes but thats basically what is it so
do not code paste
trying
ok , what version should i go for , 14.04 or 14.10 ?
not necessarily in their interest to do so , but possible .
yeah , mostly .
no worries . i bet that was a trap to help me getting started contributing : )
that 's a 1tb drive , back up where ? : d
its helpful when using inotify
there is no one answer to that as every system is different . my case all i back up is
so a slide with that name currently has the list of preinstalled apps
for which platform , and which os ?
mirror.zol.co.zw seems to work perfect and have versions up to 15.04
do you have that paste link from above ? i was on the bad box when i sent it
lsof says it 's listening on *:9292
there is an issue with linkback trail gray on serverguide 14.04 . master code is o.k . but help not
wait wait.. it starts but wo n't stop
sounds like he wants a gui for it though
not a bad suggestion , but financially for me it is more worth the time to reconvert
yes , slaves are autonomous once the build has started .
however , this is the ... what fourth bug on this i 've seen in the past two months ,
seen the mail from john ?
it was a great experience hacking on an installer
no
sudo apt-get build-dep qtmir
you might try the # ubuntu-ru for help
that ca n't happen with the official torrents . md5 would not match . seriously ? ? ?
no , you 're the proxy - *ugh*
sure , nominations on eol releases should be cleaned up , no argument there .
damn , could you add that info to a new bug ?
i know ... so we should update them all together
that could be solved by me getting around to that dpkg-source patch ( oops ) , and us adding the
just interesting ... left for a tea ( aka exercise ) too quick , failed with dep isssue
valuable tools ? : )
and android does n't ( or did n't ) support dhcpv6 , which raises some issues
could you give me channel name
i mean , it does run
why does the machine have no usb ?
it will show you what is missing
running low on memory perhaps ?
gr8 idea - will do : )
sorry man ; - )
i thought so , as well.. but , i 'll jjust let you have at it.. enjoy
just to avoid any unnecessary hacking here , did this start happening after a reboot
i have no idea of the technical details exactly , but i can see intel , amd and nvidia drivers
have i provided enough information , so that you can answer my question ?
any idea why we 're connecting to s3 with -- upload-tools ? i thought it was using gridfs ?
do you see your tabs at the bottom ?
it 's not a problem related just to amd , other folks like vmware have similar issues
err yes , sorry
if that produces no output , then please pastebin the output of `` lspci -vnn '' , or if it
there is no params.subnetinfo is there ?
: )
so you tried : cd /tmp/ec *tab* ?
done that just now - all up to date
( this is totally off-topic of course , just some experience exchange )
hm , over 3 hours ago i suppose , the next step should be soon
ok , well , as a general rule , no .
basically i 'd rather pursue alternatives
hmm , i 'm new to irc , how do i indicate that the message is to both you and
enter the efi and change the boot device from 'windows boot manager ' to the hard disk / ssd device
cd to /dev/mapper
yes
heya
yeah - i prefer to have it in initrd as well , take a look at the growpart script ,
ask sil2100 ... no idea what it is
yeah you can see 'stable-phone-overlay ' in the dashboard , it 's good
i would just install 12.04 lts
you could add a basic proc-destroy script to the charm that calls juju-process-docker destroy ...
i suck at hardware .
probably they switched from ide to sata , try ubuntu-sdk-sata : p
it checks out
np , i 'm trying out a few suggestions around the tests locally before commenting
fair enough ...
that 's more than the current makefile ; - )
thats for the sat- > ip streams of my sat receiver ... for tv
use whatever windows installer microsoft provides.. it will also deal with that `` automaticall ''
just read the logs : )
this activate call only seem to happen when someone clicks an item inside the opened scope
i made that with gimp so i beg to differ : )
is this is an older machine ?
no idea on the first . i looked at the code and thought it should work .
and then status again
so kubuntu works for you
cool : )
nope , try asking apol ?
great
by `` wrong '' i mean that there is a shadow appearing and then there 's nothing coming in from
have you tryed ubuntu 14.04.2 ?
so can i install lubuntu in them or not ?
most of the charms either have the software included or they download the software for the user . it should
for what its worth xorg-edgers is about the best trusted place to get nvidia drivers , but it does pull
sudo apt-get install pastebinit
sudo e2label /dev/xvdg returns cloudimg-rootfs
ok , when hibernating i see msg in console : `` acpi : hardware state changed while hibernating , success
just sell the first child , you can make another one later again
no /var/log/auth.log nor /var/log/secure : /
because the version of golang-systemd in the archive does not use os.unsetenv so i 'm a bit puzzled
the way you usually update phone is with an image
no , it is ddr3
please do , as releasing juju depending on unstable imports is a no-no
i 'll have a look
ok , first i 'll link you to the very-well-commented source-code for it so you get an idea of its
your vnc isnt running
i do not have root access to them btw
how can i restart lightdm service to verify ? i have ubuntu 14.04.2 lts
at what point during boot do old profiles get loaded ?
right . that 's like volume change notifications . for which we do n't turn the screen on today intentionally
not that i know of . but i 'm not a gamer so i have n't pushed the limits at
( and yes it 's a *bit* weird that *that* is responsible for operation state persistence , feel free to
wrong in this case unfortunately , 331 does n't cover the 9xx series
hmm , i see
zhazha
what ?
fair enough .
that is done so the operating system is not rewritten each time the kernel gets updated/upgraded .
if i understand your question ... allwatcherstatebacking has a method watch ( in chan < - watcher.change ) which sets
you can help by fixing all the bugs !
sure another interesting bit is i just tried it on firefox
so where i can get help for that ?
you just have to put money into the `` breaks the test suite '' fund now
yes . it goes to the spinning ubuntu logo and stays there . i found a thread on answers.ubuntu of
might very well be , a bit more detail hopefully
notmuch because it has revdeps and is popular so i was n't considering it a removal candidate , but that
turns out that if i move the fake oplog out of the `` local '' db the pauses go away
ah , that might be where this order things comes from ? ( no idea about remastering , sorry )
but in any case the changes for that are a pre-requirement for the fix for bug # 1373388 , which
so fix the errors .
tell me how you expect it to work , and i 'll tell you what you 've been smoking :
and barrydk
it might . i dont take a side without a/b testing on that one
superseded .
dont use wubi , and dont install a ubuntu version that is already dead
yes ; failed
type `` lsblk '' and then look for the usb drive device
probably best to ask kenvandine when he is about as he has made most of the bacon2d stuff
i mean , i clicked on log in and performed that loop about 20 times
says so on the handy cdimage/netboot page . : )
without vesa the de does n't charge correctly
wait , so its not possible to turn this off via gui ? ( security )
unlikely as this is an ubuntu support channel
jorge 's -- journal backport to 1.22 also needs to get into 1.23
why this is n't done automatically ?
sorry , i am butting in based on your comment above that hidden network must be used , not understanding
ip a show eth0 shows /64 , so ... however many that is , i guess ? ( `` a
right , `` r|gz '' sounds promising too
great : )
huh ?
good call that , pics are always handy to retrace your steps
no , take the system-a entry , do `` e '' , change the label= ... by /dev/vda3 and ctrl-x
is there any issue with mac address ? and how can i read mac address of other machine with arp
i 'm not too bad with designer tools ; you have the ideas , i 'll try to express them
everything was fine untill i had to install cuda toolkit , then it messed up my driver abit , that
it was n't me who said it , but 'brainfuck ' is the name of a programming language .
what version of ubuntu
hah hah
best show then ' sudo apt-get -f install ; sudo dpkg -c ' . lets see the errors .
at the shell command-line
i 'm excited that we 're getting lxd support . especially if that means machine 0 will not be my
question for you : how much do we care about returning `` invalid part '' when it does n't have
put the live usb in and when you reach grub as usual type ls -l and see if it shows
i believe the very first thing i see on the screen on booting is something about acpi probe failing
and if we do n't give an environment a human-readable when it is created , that 's our own fault
i 'll add it to the schedule just to remember
u-d-f on device provisioning
there 's no other way to do this - this is the only cuda-compatible machine i have and it 's
so , am i supposed to use it as user or root ?
you think the problem could come from there ?
that 's not lsusb
you ca n't change ownership like that . i was curious what options it was mounted with
fair warning : t'is a deep well and so much fun ! hours and hours in search of artistic perfection
funny story -- i am a new father . and i 'm quite glad i 'm not around him at
what if you hash the final filename , though ?
yes installing now
size < > available space
set discuss in your favs mate : p
regarding irc , my problem is that the only computer with an irc computer is microsoft and it 's blue
meizu doesnt sell em yet - right ?
2 . when this happens , did you received any messages or other notifications just before ?
ah yes , our lightdm.service does n't check for `` text ''
and are you able to ssh public key to other machines
believe it 's trying to make the .tar.gz in the local folder but looks like you 're in a /cdrom
nice to see interest . ; )
it 's basically connection
and were these devices working when you did the install ?
tegra hardware is problematic
so there is no solution
jump to creating an efi system partition
ubuntu made some magic for you : p
then make a choice based on your research
and we can check back in a bit and get something which will suck less : )
also , apt-get install linux-image-generic
yeah , only the intel one appears
ok - go back to the task - refresh it - if you 've done the new task - you
it was this `` teward > chompy : ( java 8 is evil ) ''
should then be absolutely no problem in splitting the hard deive up for both .
... methinks .
or better : show a `` cat /etc/apt/sources.list '' in a pastebin to be sure
clonezilla is amazing
how many sims do you have ?
it 's on my list : )
open that with nano `` sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/owncloud.list '' and then change the 15.04 to a 14.04.then ctrl+o , ctrl+x
sudo hfs-bless /mnt/boot/efi/efi/ubuntu/system/library/coreservices/boot.efi
umm - that is not us - that is them
what code , exactly ?
oh i see , they all unpacked into the same filename all writing over each other
i normally change it to 'super '
are you running ubuntu desktop or some other flavor
no my issue has nothing todo with webdm , but that could be fixed by adding a way to define
ffs i 'm stupid
the snappy package has nothing to do with snappy ; )
i guess i know the problem
yup . i did the exact thing that you are doing right now yesterday .
yeah , i guess they have n't had a promotion in ages ?
am i dead in the water ? is there way to run them in my emulator ?
when you get a root shell , type mount -o remount , rw /
omg , an image ?
to find what in them ? the entries ?
should i reboot ?
anyhow , was just a data point . i 'm with you on prefering lts kernels , but 3.13 definitely
ok
/etc/apache2
that 's because networkname should be set on the interfaceinfo
flash drive boot or dvd ?
let 's see if didrocks agrees ; - )
they might have uca specific fixes but imo , this one is n't specific to uca
whoopsie is ... ( and in a degraded form apport too , yes )
functions ? you mean aliases in bash ?
better to do 2 or 3 utc
do you know where it takes those from in that case , since you said it actually failed copying them
maybe we should turn this to a dual landing silo ?
or newport .
hmm that 's a good catch !
in other words : australia 29 ( 71 % ) , india 10 ( 24 % ) , no result
that 's a card reader
fginther says now ubuntu-touch/devel-proposed points to a wily image , so it could be it ?
may be confusion there ? hooks and actions are just scripts
the description sums up what 's going on
there is a basic scientific inquiry methodology .
i see
it 's a temporary solution
i guess qa can decide that no testing is needed and just approve it , but we have the gates
ok , i see
that we plan to address early next week , along with other handful of boottest annoyances
i know right ? : d let me install muon then : )
i just realized- wicd has no support for vpn connections ... and i use a pptp vpn connection when i
i dont suggest you do.. just those 3 are all you are removing.. light-locker* light-locker-settings* lubuntu-desktop*
e.g . vs 15.04/
sure , i 'll do that
oh , i see , for core profile , compatibility profile , etc . ?
if you remove the hdd , it could boot , but how would you check the hdd 's health ?
5.0.3 copied .
riddle me this ... touch security as pin number , why do i need a whole keyboard and have to
anpok : ok for some reason the train is still failing to recognize that glmark is in the archive already
i am just hoping to fix it .
ormally you should be able to install newer version after adding the ppa and sudo apt-get update
95
ack
how can i do that ?
possibly . i certainly was using 1.22 previously but i 'm fairly certain i destroyed it and started over ,
well , i mostly use it for the remove/clean tasks and to shred files . : )
from what i 've seen the old interface is not preserved ( so the confusing exists ( ) and matches
then windows would n't be in that list^^ ext4 in that case . ( but with windows , go ntfs
purge gnome fallback perhaps and reinstall ?
oh if you can that 'd help a bit
you 'll learn a lot if you 're nice in here
ah that is thing i 'm not familiar with
i can flash it yes
any chance we could add those log files and then rerun vivid ?
just phone
from `` /usr/sbin/service '' : `` ... # upstart configuration exists for this job and we 're running on upstart
there 's a vast variety in the hardware
+1
you did in fact publish it ? then it should be in the store once the approval passes
ask # # windows
what 's your backup proposal ?
try # lubuntu instead , since this is a supportchannel for ubuntu
calling /etc/init.d/dbus is not the most efficient as it needs to go through the lsb script , but it should
actually..
something like sda , sdb , sdc , sdd , sde etc etc
yeah
no & yes.. we share the responsibilities here : ) you 'll get used to that by time : )
oerheks : i did n't know about apt instead of apt-get until just recently .
clean 32-bit 14.10 loaded . following the page , first step is to apply updates . running now . alas
yes
shouldnt
email or ?
i do n't have a clear idea what we should do with it ( yet ) , but if you
also , i do n't think i fully understood your earlier question , could you expand ?
yeah , i did too .
so , can we make that the workflow ? file a bug after the mp lands with the failing est
no way
yeah but i thought it was the indicator that triggered them via messaging indicator
np
reboot again ?
sorry , i 'm going back to your `` experience '' comment , which also holds little value by itself
yes you are here ; - )
i have php5-fpm installed
i would suggest using a windows channel , or google , since it has nothing to do with linux
what 's start.sh suppose to do ?
that wo n't be enough , we 'll need the ok
so it 'replaces ' the existing image file ?
you 're smart to ask , you have great help , i will hang if needed .
ignore me .
i 'm on it , no worry
is what showed up
after adding a kernel there 's usually a trigger fired which sohuld call the update-grub hook and do it for
so my biggest concern would be regressions , rather than confirming those branches fix things
dell inspriron : 15-5547
if i was n't busy i would just reply the upgrade tests
i still do n't get how ~ % ( ppa ) s works : )
so that value is active now .
there 's useful information on that page including instructions and such
read the man page of ppa-purge .
ok , so i 'll switch a bunch of the breaks to conflicts . thans .
ahh i see , my bad , i saw 14.04 and mixed that with 15.04 ... my bad !
hmm no ideas then i 'm afraid , never actually used that before
yeah : /
there 's lots of yeast in it , so it 's not just grape juice
i 've no experience with xorg.conf sorry
what do you think ?
i guess in the readme file for the charm
use 'pastebinit ' to send logs etc .
ah
probably someone else logged in with it
so i have to back up one of those partitions to a disc and basicly remove it and replace it
ok ... so you now have 2 working screens ?
did you try deleting settings ?
np
actually ... i see mzanetti has a vivid silo , i 'll hop in that one , but it 'll
yeah
alis bot ? is that something online , or inside of the irc chat ?
yeah , we 're saying not to boot to recovery mode - but to let it boot normally , then
go stick your nose somewhere else . you 're not helping me with my problem with my usb .
cheers - my memory is rusty
well , the thing is that if you 're writing something ... and something opens , the focus should n't
that 's a problem : )
little-inferno
so i suppose you do n't want help if you think you 're right ? : ) i do this
i will bloody try
rw-rw-r
well , you 're `` messing around '' it very well i notice , so ... success !
because that 's not a real package name .
keep in mind that its slow over network and samba
because i manually disabled networking by moving a file away from interfaces.d
the openstack on lxd demo wayne did was pretty sweet
yes
right , but the topics you listed above seem like they are a list of the branches you submitted .
btw can i start kci rebuilds ?
why is only the first two paragraphs of the meta/readme used ? makes it tough to format things decently
web server so i 'll need apache php mysql
its not officialy supported here
you 're the one who chose to download the chinese version without reading whatever link you followed .
update , upgrade , then dist-upgrade
when you insert an sd card the module should be reloaded automatically
i 'm on devel-proposed/here channel , are there any packages i can install to try it ?
for instance , from my naive understanding , i understand that this is about delivering spreed easily ; i instinctively
can i see the output of `` uname -a '' please

unsure then , check with # ubuntu-unity
maybe check out what is included in the ubuntu studio releases
ok , that tells us tty1 is 'special ' : )
try renicing ?
pici i can ping the server , but the server can not paste to pastebinit , odd
( and land the pr from 4 before moving on to 5 )
that was going to be my concern . that 's part of the bug that we wanted to fix
sadly i put a lot of effort into making the train work with unicode in py3 but this is bzr
we are n't live yet , so big deal : p
10x . so just to conclude : you 're 100 % sure it 's not technically possible ?
current image still does right thing for parts installed after boot right ?
ahemm , nope , the idea behind hibernation , is that the `` shutdown state '' is kept , and
from memory it uses the same api as sendmail . check the man page
( especially when the network is involved , as it is here )
just into the archive ?
yes , dmesg , and /var/log/gpu-manager.log
it does n't really matter
should i do it again ? ?
i 'm trying to find out the same too , it looks like it 's just a deb mirror
the vsync settings are correct , we checked earlier
the open source config is /usr/share/x11/xorg.conf.d
same issue , roughly
oh ok : d
much appreciated
? if you have hexchat , you can easily add him to /ignore
did you look into libinput transition ?
or if the workstation was powered down and will be back online monday i 'd like to be able to
there might be better touchscreen support though , but if most things are working now then maybe dont mess with
it 's not an ordering issue as there are not maps involved there at all , something else is wrong
you rock !
i want some thing that show me the bandwidth all the time
yeps
ah , true that , they 'd be nice to have soonish as s390x progresses . anyway , i 'm
i used to double up.. a key with a passphrase : )
am not working today : )
well yeah having this around the holidays is freaking nuts . not to mention that alpha 's coming up soon
hmm
has the systemd transition for desktop happened yet ?
i dont think so
my browser does that too ?
that sounds about right
k
just check dpkg -s libqt5network5
okay , that makes a little more sense then : )
as long as we do n't say we maybe the images and credit the right people legally we should be
dpkg -l | grep nvidia
how can i change the mirror ?
well is it xeon class ?
: )
working ? or same errors as the last one ?
one that i thought could be really good is to track how many txns are in the collection and only
d'oh .
hm
it will store everything in a script file in the dir where you ran it
yep
ici il a fait chaud quelques jours mais plus depuis 1 semaine
did you not read my email ?
oh , that works fine for me
and it is a bug in the acpi dsdt firmware of the hp . when it detects the linux os
i have n't tested it in this direction ( i 'm running wily and have trusty/vivid/wily containers ) , but
i 'd still like to see `` ls /home | pastebinit ''
thx
undo the content of the apt history.log which will list what was done last
super cool either way
but it 's possible with the help of a chroot , i know that : )
ok good !
`` ubuntu-device-flash touch -- channel=ubuntu-touch/stable/bq-aquaris.en '' was what worked for me earlier this evening
ok , so i 'll move it
that 's the crux of the bug
test ack
if you have a full iso and a usb , why is that not okay for an install .
thx for the bug
i know , i was just afraid if it af- oh wait i am not mounted
yes . i just did that . one question first ; is your linux partition after the windows partition ?
i 'm sure their next question would be `` but it was qa granted , can we publish it and
what test needs removing to fix the suite ?
cloud images could be tougher . hrm . the only tarballs we guarantee to have for derived distro are lp-buildd
yeah , worst name eva
i abandoned windows because of security and privacy issues , i hope i can deal with them in linux :
these repos are just for documentation purposes - the authoritative source sources ( ! ) are still the uploaded tarballs
no , this is about the seeds and composition part
sure
can you run [ sudo fsck -f /dev/sdxy ] ( $ x = drive letter , $ y = partition
really ? in hardware or in software ? either way , i highly doubt it .
yes , you told me the basics about it some months ago .
no , that 's a build dependency for mir
what codec are you trying ?
what do i do about it ?
yes , or set up your dhcp server to point to it
bill knows about that ?
ok
so our build-depends might indeed be excessive
if you run dmesg , what drive letter comes up at/near the end ?
your statement is true , but the 'in andriod build step ' the the one i document in that repo
lets try deleting that symlink again : `` rm -f /sbin/initctl '' then `` ls -l /sbin/initctl '' it should
yes , this seems similar problem . the actual error is that it ca n't find the process to introspect
so give me the right answer pls : )
ohhh ! the : : - is the search/replace ?
you 'd be purchaser # 11 actually , my little apps is doing better than i expected : )
i would suggest you make a new thread in that forum i just linked so the specialists could have a
mind reconfiguring ubuntu silo 9
what nvidia driver ? and when ? were the fonts ok before that installation ? are you sure its the
please stop this here
xchat settings have these settings ?
sorry for that brainfart
yes , i 've been able to reproduce locally and look at the symptoms . unity8 does not come up
more of a job for your media player , really
howis this related to ubuntu support ?
did you create the boot media with unetbootin ?
nope , the compiled apps are different in size for x86 vs x64 architecture ... they are
yes with sudo you use your user password .
tagging ?
oh , hmm
or wine 's appdb as i 'm sure other people using wine have encountered your issue
well my thought was if my raid fails , i could rebuild it and just restore the whole thing rather
okay , is it mounted , look in goarted as well .
especially if you want the program to be better and smarter than what we have now
gsv.qml:236
i seem to have all of the plasma beta but , for instance , if i try to re-add kubuntu-desktop
i can write something down if you provide me with anything you have , i 'll ask about the missing
systemd is default for vivid
does `` rfkill list '' show a bluetooth radio ?
booting off a pendrive and getting the logs : )
trying to put it into a variable
what are you referring to ?
as stupid as this may sound , but you could be right : d
i 'm trying to see if it says anything about why the installer has stalled
but i have 3.19 . ( 14.04.3
and the rest
0.4.6+16.04.20151113-0ubuntu1 is latest .
and check err ! = nil & & ! os.isnotexist ( err )
so , either was mask the unit by default , either we enable it for everyone , not feeling well
when did you update last ?
it appears it has something to do with the temperature sensors and fan control but nothing definitive so far on
hmm true
ok , that sounds sensible
about double screen i 'm very puzzled
google searches for that error suggest an incomplete file was transferred .
i am sysadmin at a web hosting company
if it work at your first fresh install ... you might wan na reinstall fresh then
sure : )
wine does n't have any wince or pocketpc compatibility options as far as i can find
yes
did n't realize you were so well versed ! ( chroot no less ! ) i 'm very surprised the
no way
if i dont put the folder to www-data : www-data my apache can not write to this folder ?
so , how about parade of tears ?
will send you a hi link
hmm , i do n't think so
probably not , unity 8 is n't ready for convergence juuuust yet , but i 've seen videos of unity
most applications he will download will automatically be chmodded correctly
on your calendar
haha
on unity sidebar windows minimize back to the icon , is that what you mean ?
is it possible that i need an additional driver for internal 3g ?
i use the pepperflash in chrome on quite old/slow machines..
any best way of installing ? or i have to download first
i do n't have a utopic vm set up to do that in . so i 've not been able
try `` go get -u launchpad.net/godeps & & go install launchpad.net/godeps '' or something like that
it just lists the zone and shows something like europe/prague for me
ah ok
then it almost certainly cve-2015-2925 . everything else is unrelated
otp , but will look
there is , afaik , but i do n't have a timeline .
also , who actually calls setwindowtitle from the qtubuntu change ? should n't there be a version bump and some
ok , so you probably should have that there too ...
rest of the net ?
so the initial copy went bad , cloud-init ran with its `` default '' config as all those file were
when i 'm looking at existing code i 'm not expecting a perfect world . i only care that apps
sorry , i got caught up with something else here it is : lp : ~dpm/help-app/attr-lists-and-embedded-html
so , a charm can never status-set error . what if the software is irreparably broken ?
so what 's the recommended approach here ?
it should show `` cryptmount/trusty , now 4.5-1 amd64 [ installed ] ''
would a system with udev uninstalled still function long enough for it to be reinstalled ?
i am nutjobless : - (
those days you offer to take me to the pub , yes
you can send multi-part cloud-config over .
which ip network ? the internet ? some network at your office ? some network at home ?
i know centos
can confirm your test case
yeah that was a general question : )
this is os support , not dev support .
ok , pastebin that please : )
the global section is unmodified from the smb.conf defaults .
actually , i 'm running latest systemd already , no issue at boot
it gives me a can not umount because there is something busy about it . then when the rsync happens
yes , that makes sense
mii-tool or ethtool shows which cable is connected ?
ie , should i give them n days to play with glibc 2.22 and report back to me , or
so the only question is what does happen when the system gets updated . someone sets snappy_mode to try -
also ... hmmm i 'm thinking a meetup would be apropos too
`` < address > apache/2.2.29 ( unix ) server at 167.160.171.68 port 80 < /address > ''

pretty much yes
really ? mount /dev/cdrom /mnt does n't return anything ? whats in $ ? ?
i know , read your uestion : ) i answer it in my chat from 19:27
not really complaining , i get to learn stuff
cu . gtg .
have you rebooted since installing the 331 driver ?
oh . if you 're using udd/bzr for this and trusting the branches to be accurate , stop that .
k we 're quite low , start with wily first and then we can do vivid afterwards
maybe it just has n't got to your music yet ?
this was a 90s era ... 98 or 99 ?
# ubuntu-server
in changelog it 's ok but actually it 's cleaner if you just revert your last commit and use the
i only noticed after the general whirlwind yesterday
can you test if kcalc works with your numeric keypad ?
i certainly agree
but if i was a user with access to an env , but not the state server env then i
ok , i leave that to you with great pleasure : )
could you also run the same on your machine for wide-preview branch ?
could use cat and tee to populate the file : - )
heya , i 'm about : )
yeah -- it 's not great , but afaics documenting the structs is less awful than any other approach
indeed . i never set out to fix that or any of those tests ; _ ;
yes
just space concerns ?
i am thinking i should just go for nvidia as people seem to have a lot less issues with it
maybe i should just uninstall the one i have now and install the one from repos
but those tools are unusable with gio / gvfs fuse , so the question is : is there a possibility
let me try to produce a quick py example
okay i will watch the merge and retry as needed
alright . i 'll grep my way into finding the alarm model : )
and there 's an item for the usb stick ?
the daemon is written for a different init system named upstart . this one is named systemd and requires different

shall i file a bug on lp : snappy ?
a sudo apt-get update might also do magic after removing ppa
on second thought , i could make that work.. i missed the fact that i could call hasnext ( )
indeed.. there 's something more awkward going on there
was this machine at one point provisioned ?
but , nothing more can be done 'til the package manager is in a happy state .
i 'm pretty sure when i first bought the phone and turned it on it asked me to upgrade from
so i thkn that means we should have marked the the first one `` fixed '' so it was ignored
what did you try ?
hmm.. i might have , let me have a look

well it is installer time to reboot and see if it broke : d
ooi , why was fakechroot good enough for later releases , but not trusty ?
( and a website question to an extent ) and afaik the website provides no download button for the books
heh
i hope laney sent you one this time : )
did you try other ui elements ( expanding the panel or right swipe ) ?

understand
yeah now we have a new ticket : )

let me do it again
better ?
also , sometimes helps setting an image like that as your wallpaper : )
cool will stop by ops next time
that is more a topic for # ubuntu-offtopic

yes indeed : )
just the line where you are issuing the post ( )

one of the reasons i 'm confused is that we allegedly have 16+ ipv6 addresses . the second reason is

well , you pinged me with the question : ) anyways , the answer is you can do that ,
to preserve bandwidth for other applications or users on the network
something is strange then . maybe its the software i use . idk
on it

does it give you a nice dialog that explains what it 's doing then install language packs ?
i 'm using vivid , but my click framework is 14.10
you can do it ! : )
warty is ... a codename for a specific older version of the distro , iirc
works fine for me .
a standard install to a usb flash drive is pretty unusably slow .
i assume the target also has windows on ?
well , then you need a parser or something to make it reasonable , or a wyswig editor
web based .
usually it is due to not unmounting properly before unplugging the drive so the fs gets tainted
do you know where is andrea ? it 's a couple of weeks i do n't see his pushes
yeah i know , but the package is not there , also the apt-cache search does n't find it

does it just say `` retrieving location '' ?
nobody in ubuntu-packaging . dead channel ?
sorry i could n't help : /

i hybrid bootable means as well as the standard iso9660 optical media layout it has an alternative hard-disk boot partition

why does shimmer-themes orion work correctly with headerbar , but the one from git does n't ?

what are you putting in directory .desktop anyhow ? what 's the symlink pointing to ?

maybe that drdy is a faulty hardware
i had ubuntu installed before .
so why even ask here if you 're going to ignore everyone
are you certain you have an intel gpu ?
i see
yes . unity-scope-tool works normally

what was the fstab question ?
i 've got the copy tests failing , could have been my merge , but i saw this comment from
of course i am right ; )
if you remove the repo its senseless to stay with that package
hi ! did you see my ping from yesterday ?
if you could check , i 'd be immensely happy
and as far as /var/log/syslog goes should i grep it for relevant stuff or just paste the whole file ?
awesome , and txnrevno ?
does n't it mean we have to stop cloning
if you happen to investigate/have any more info , please let me know : )
or did you try to `` php '' then command line functions ?
no
what another screenshot program coud i try ?
what 's the issue ?
i copied your command line from irc into a terminal and could reproduce your error . when i analysed it
yeah it will have to be manual
so how can i get back to an up to date bootable system , i wonder ?
it 's a case-by-case basis , and you probably want cking 's input on the usual usage pattern . i
ok , good luck : )
i do n't understand your question . what are you trying to do ? what are you expecting to happen
sure
yes ... note the `` amd64 '' in that error
yep .
get the tomcat source from ubuntu . if you do n't know how to do that , you 're probably
then buy the real ubuntu version of the phone , if you want a supported phone running ubuntu
can you show me an example ?
ok open the terminal application with ctrl+alt+t then type `` sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get install pastebinit ''

yes

it is clickbait
i 'd be happy with git uploaded soon .
you should not run a eol ubuntu release anyway .
maybe , but it is one thing to try ruling out .
childish
weird because nothing changed for the rotate to not happen
actually that would n't make sense else it 'd almost imply it locks the frequency when running only on battery
if it was , you 'd be in a world of pain with libraries .
yeah , we do n't have branch level voting . it will be tricky
yes quite different realm . : )
no problem
interesting , anyway , it should not be a print ( ) or whatever it is , but a log
i 'm curious , what is it about cassandra charm that makes the current logic problematic ?
hmm ; my json query shows zero though ... yeag
we have a brand new chroot agent mechanism what will speed up the start time from the second start

yes
are you sure that dhcp is n't just overriding your manual set entries when it refreshes ?

look like legacy is working
using the .ec2.archive.ubuntu.com ones will likely 'fix ' the problem and use the ec2 archives , but ... : /
yeah - are you formatting the ubuntu volumes ?
sure
why is that ?
does n't answer my question
i have n't narrowed down which test it is i 'm afraid
that silo installs ok as long as -proposed is enabled , so not for the unity stack as far as
that 's close to what i said..

i never said they did.. *but* there are many parts of the system to `` panic '' about
nope , it 's just a `` raw '' copy
make sure your sources.list and sources.d match on both systems , then install the same packages on the new system

iirc we are about 2 weeks out
pop in your ubuntu disk and when you get to the option to `` try ubuntu or install ubuntu ''
generally the pc uefi boot menu should offer 2 boot options for the isntaller , legacy and efi . sometimes
no i already know whats going on , bug is just to track
its everything what lspci had printed ?
how are the charmhelpers managed ? i see that the charmhelpers installed with pip differ from those embedded in neutron-api/next
www.imgur.com should work
jinx .
ah , perhaps i could log upower activity then
but there are other issues as well
huge diff .
so , as i ask , do you have a cursor in the guest account ? yes or no ?
but a `` sudo parted -l | pastebinit '' would be handy
no problem ! and if you need any more help , do n't be afraid to ping me : )
good . i saw your g+ post about getting your glasses removed..i was thinking of doing the same later this
nope , i have a ton of prep to do before i can release .
but yes , this removes autorun.inf , which ran wubi.exe .
using what ? wtf aka webkit or webengine ?
you could use a vpn
i dont use proxies so i have no idea then

did the command work ?
belgium , you ?
well , in almost all cases , unless the dude is a serious hacker , there 's a trail ,
i did `sudo mount /dev/sdf1 /mnt/` and it worked .
the gstreamer library is used by ubuntu touch , probably the 'gstreamer ' application too .
it is a layout element
yes i checked there , they are not saying anything about this .
ubuntu is meant to be customized to the users needs , so set whatever config you feel best
is what you need not in the ubuntu repositories ?
okay , i 'll relay this to miltosk .

idk what your talking about : )

i had assumed you would look at debian/rules and find the correct option
i wonder if we need another list for wily , or maybe milestone as well
everything in repos should also show software centre
that 's what i 'm working on right now
windows hibernating ? yeah that could muck things up

can you recall what cards in your pci slots ?
the scheme of cloud-images is a bit different

done , ty for fix
so does autopilot only work with en-us settings ?
what were you upgrading from ?
add an extra nic or do it all with the one onboard ?
are you sure about netflix not working ?
you will be able to start the import there
and if you boot that one even now , it works fine ... just anything newer and it 's basic
it 's giving a lot of errors
trusty has 6.6
no but i can .
you can try different times of day/week and reach a different batch of people , someone might know .
and since smoketesting infrastructure assumes and expects each of the apps to have tests , it 's b0rken
right . he has camera packages on there too , but i guess i will try both rebuild and use

what version of mir ? if you 're 0.12 you should be fine
well , in gplv2 it 's quite simple , if you distribute a compiled driver or something else that links

next i will do a bit of code cleanup and write code to import files like the existing snappy-system.txt
not intentionally ...
try what seriouslylaugh said
the wot m8 ?
upgraded from 14.10 originally , but before beta1 . everything worked so far , except for the kubuntu-notifications-helper/kded5 issue and
the other day , i made a youtube music extractor app . wouldnt work on the phone though because of
i 've tried , and found it 's rubbish
trying to get the same pid is even more strange , let alone impossible .
yes , please
perhaps
nano will not be there at initial install with the current bug .
i should really have thought of doing that . i 'll disconnect the old one and see .
did you file an rt ?
that 's the amd64 binary from 218-8ubuntu2
yea
what os do you have on that box ?

from the apps point of view it is tmp , if you look at it from the outside , it
real question - why do you want 3.19 ? what do you think it 's going to give you ?
anyhow , on a brighter note , i 've only just seen your pr on the init systems , and
trigraph that 's a good idea ! `` reboot_force '' maybe
you know.. he trusts you to handle it , be worthy of the trust : )
many folks working on snappy are at a sprint now - if nobody answers , you could try to write
i 'd say that the names you proposed should be enough as the initial transition worked this way
says hardblocked
do we need adduser at all ( asking , no idea if yes or no ) : )
i dont know how that persistent storage on liveusb works i never really used that
as i said , no experience with your configuration . also : uefi does play a part . ask again
it should use /usr/share/libmuon/applicationsbackend/releasechecker to check
what did you think was going to prevent editing the file ?
one more thing , will there be any problem with boot if i had to delete the windows partition ?
ah that one ... thx
based on process environment
cool !
i bet there is a way in python and i have it somewhere to check ; in any case ,
not yet
yea : (
did you make any changes that you know of before this started happening ? any bios updates ?
i can however see it at 'software & updates ' under the 'other software ' tab .
feel free to ask the others questions afterwards ; ) i am away for today though
try compiling from the git repository ?
i know loads of folks who have been having these viruses , me too infact

no , it needs x

jay was very suspicious about the fact that it was receiving packets with itself as the source address
but i guess the store reviewers/admins did n't see it that way ; )
something such as openerp/odoo ?
what do i do next ?
sure
how did you formatted that partition ?
looking at another bug
jibel : yeah , in theory , but making it smarter would mean it would have to scan the whole
yes , for some time now
it reboots ... it doesnt shutdown
no , it 's perfect .
i checked them at bios level and the drives show up as healthy
same
yes , only for maas and until we have import in place
near the bottom it says he uses it to do bios updates .
yes , marked it so
true , but without the 15.04-framework , developers cant get to use u.c 1.2 ?
well , as i 'm sure you know , nothing 's impossible : )
and as a stakeholder , you have every right to say fix now

it should . i mentioned that earlier ; thought you 'd done it

does that sound reasonable ?
right , i get that

good luck tho : )

i hate it when that happens .
if so i 'll check it in a bit after dinner then approve the task if its all cool
and i do n't mind about adding the autopilot dependency in there . anyway we will have plenty of autopilot
haha , you 're funny .
but this at least works around the issue for now and is no worse than what we had before
sure , friend
i see . it seems the plasma in the backport ppa is few version behind from that of 15.10 daily
right ; so as i understand it , someone already made the determination that a library rename was n't needed
hi mate
ah , okay , that 's not an ubuntu problem , then , you have to reach out to support
but from the shell ya it 's work nice
this will solve you the top margin issue
no problem
replace lightdm with gdm if you have gnome . or whatever windows manager your login screen uses .
yes ubuntu
do you have a link to the source package of 3.8.0-2 ?

no crashes reported
sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid
what can i do about that ?
i 'll try to do in a few
any reason for what ?
different layer i guess
i 'm really sorry but i 'm falling asleep
well , i 'm talking about forcing . not instructing the application in it 's config-files .
i use windows 8.1 as my host . i 've got a working install of ubuntu gnome on another partition
many things one could try . a proper application of testdisk is the more likely to resolve . or so
that is the whole purpose .. if they edit it , it 's toast , if they ca n't decrypt
swordfish is n't that bad if you just treat it like all standard hollywood spy/thriller/action/hacker films you know complete fabrications
use hostname < somehostname > to set the hostname , or to do it permanently : edit /etc/hosts to include
i do n't htink that should happen . the headers are very similar
that is n't constant as it depends on hardware anything you add to startup so we ca n't be sure
and then it becomes super important for me to remember to undo that change when you 're done
how are you trying to pull them
you know any programming ?
nice ! i tried to answer as much as possible on systemd and systemd-boot bugs , did n't touch anything
not yet
so you 'd do the reverse of that ^^
we did that already ...
oh , it might relate to there also being a new keystone .
the fact that a newer version of s-i was in ubuntu-rtm/14.09 than in vivid was never on my radar ...
ah ... i just found out ... .someone did something naughty
you can also run a command like : nautilus ssh : // < username > @ < second_computer's_ip_address

how much ram do you have ?
i 've not done the rc thing before .
ok , package pushed
yeah good call
he says he ca n't use krita well so ... i guess
nah . it installs flash and stuff .
a lesson in how not to run things : i am temporarily putting lds on my gitlab barebones box :

if you 're clocks are n't reasonably close to reality there is n't really much we can do is there
shift+insert should work though ,
what 's the problem ?
i was going to suggest that your boot partition was using fat , which does n't support symbolic links ,
this really depends on your needs mate
you can use multiple -iname , if you put -o ( for `` or '' ) in between
edit the motd ?
yup rebooting now
true , but i can always keep my iso somewhat up-to-date .
are you sure you still want telnetd ? it is horribly insecure .
iterating over a variant
whatever distribution you choose , in your case the real importat factor is really the kernel
i 'm ok with that
and your installing server 15 in legacy usb mode . when you go to partition the table , in cfdisk
msdos
i have yet to see the info i asked for
even so . this is currently hurting those who are using a `` devel '' branch ( fortunately not myself
are you proposing a session ?

by using kaffeine or mplayer , e.g .

yeah i mean i can get it to work but there should be a way to choose what to receive

only drivers for windows ... : (
yeah but you sound be able to edit the mps
is vivid a lts ?
`` lsb_release -a | pastebinit ''
maybe can you check your grafix card driver loaded ?
it really depends on the application
well since you have both in a laptop i 'd assume so
you moved our meeting to a time i now have busy
no , udf installs the bootloader to /efi/boot/bootx64.efi
shure , it 's my job today
that 's fine that gives me 3-4 hours to test it : )
there is opentox
add init=/bin/bash to your kernel line in grub

i have a feeling that the work arounds are more work than just doing it right in the first place
go to the dash > startup
the 340
14.10 xubuntu
maybe because i installed from a kubuntu daily iso 5 weeks ago and installed the unity desktop after that ,
i 'd trust auto-detect if there 's an edid - on some large-screens the edid can vary based on which
fb spies on you.. ubuntulog here is logging whatever we discuss here , so when i 'm about to confirm
are you kidding me ?
if you have capabilities needed by multiple facades , great , move them into ( a subpackage of ) apiserver/common
if `` around here '' is london , i suspect you might get your wish .
ah , cool .
i wo n't most likely be doing a technical proposal , so the other side will win ; )
yes
just fix paster . : )
a little over a minute on arale if we change both
ironically , we 're already one more level deep using gocheck
load usb live on the problem system and then install ... one sec
the one for the ext4 , and /boot/efi and the swap
we could do a vivid branch for overlay
saviq : i do n't think it tells us much though , because i get similar output on krillin right
which one ?
is it a 64bit machine ?
ok - passed that now , so studio have 32/64 bit installs done and some livesession
that was the only change
no kidding : )
download link ?
what driver is that ?
whatever makes your pc boot ... try them all
if you look a bit further down there 's an identical stanza with identical version number .
it came new with ntfs . but i since removed it .
is there any way to search a ppa for a file like we can do in the main archives ?
krillin
me neither ! our two useless datapoints now draw a useless data curve : )
you should choose drop to root shell to get a terminal
weird , that 's mako/rtm ?
what bugs ?
haha : - )
something like dpkg -- get-selections
pretty much yes . with an app on my phone or an xbox360 remote controller
well , you could parse the indices yourself and generate your own database .
merci !
sorry but that is server-basics .
would be nice to use the `` ` [ code ] annotation eventually : - )
today
maybe you can join # ubuntu-desktop ?
because their mobile device is a remote control for it
type sudo blkid | nc termbin.com 9999
forking allows people to patch things who have no write access to that repository .
yes , but we only try to allocate it when we 're about to start it initially
pm as in email ?
well i did n't publish it . lem me check
or apt-cache policy nvidia-current if you 're using the default driver
how did you create the usb
unlikely . those settings are stored in your homedir , which even an apt-get -- purge will not touch .
follow your guide
that is a `` system '' script
ok
you are speaking about what ? the utik translation issue ?
what was the bug report site again ? i will add it to my favs
how do i check how succesful the cat was ? by trying to recover files from it ?
what are the exact steps to reproduce the error ?
maybe analytics
okay , i uspected they would have said if necessary however i tried it and it was damn fast
server pings the client ok ?
no not the whole thing , just played with the greeter
if you are deploying a large bundle , how often are there strange relation config issues ?
hurry up im tired and dont feel like helping you further
yes
done , i guess you 'll have to rebuild the silo
i always only go one step at a time
it will appear . you only have to unlock it
we could just trust the test
so the only option is to use a vm ? kinda annoying : (
pretty sure ls is using maas though ...
cool , tx
oh interesting
maybe if you rub it on your cat before every boot : )
what changed ?
that doesnt matter for a 6mb file : )
ok i 'll send you the link .
ok
i got started on it , but only just
the chroot is only intended for kernels that do n't support unprivileged lxc 's .
if i move it to 30 mins earlier , you should be able to make it for the first half
i am planning about adding all the series listed in juju-core , except for centos and arch , is that
is it ?
make sure to use a version scheme like `` *-0ubuntu1~wily0 ''
that rules out the problem i had then sorry : ) have a look for your lan/module on google and
wut ?
why ntfs ? is there some reason you ca n't use samba for this ? or another network filesystem ?
this command should give info about unity /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p
ok
you can upload anything to the silo but the only time checkupload is not enforced is if the package is
oh really thats not correct
you always seem really busy
it 's wrong to say no one
how bout u try rimming my boipucci
indeed
it installed all the deps but unity8 wo n't start
tough chance , i 've assigned that as a work item to steve to sort out .
and my vagrant -- version has the same 1.4.3 so i do n't think i compiled or anything
found it !
also if /e/n/i already has a static config for the primary nic , we should move it into the juju-br0
how did you have it load nvidia-modeset ?
not the zoomable image bug
sure
now , check the most recent xorg log file . identify its name first with `` ls -latr /var/log/ ''
ah , i meant in the context of the -- device switch to u-d-f as per popey 's correct instructions
would it be easy for you to test the notification background fix ?
yep
and i 'd take that into mind when formulating my own decision
sorry .
does scrolling work ?
ie it does n't show an update for a non-aliased package
i cant complain : )
i 'm not logged into the system with a gui
then you have n't made a key yet
maintenance
i just wondered about doing an mp vs. just attaching a patch , etc .
frobware has had various issues with the upgrade ( node addresses and leases )
sorry about that , sent you a msg about dnsmasq by mistake
at least buy him dinner first
ok
i 'm likely to go quiet - right in the middle of trusty .2 release stuff for one
gparted would n't give the same error
if you 're back , would you have any idea which package powers the wallpaper in lxqt ?
`` dpkg -l '' will show all the installed packages
it say can not enable . maybe the usb cable is bad ?
we do n't support illegal activities in here .
well , it failed to build
*blink*
we can grow linux by getting tux tattoos on our foreheads .
only nvidia-common
?
but we ca n't start upgrade until mongo is up and running
your url to the ppa is a 404 . which ppa was it really ? : )
no . and that 's not `` normal '' here .
lennart is currently on a `` catch up with ml and patches '' quad-damage spree , so good time :
where did you get this .iso ? ?
yeah i might be forced to use a desktop ubuntu if i ca n't find an easy way to download
woch ubuntu version do you have ?
hm , strange , you 're already added - did you check the 'ci-train-users ' checkbox when logging into bileto
what 's the proposal ?
not *quite* : )
i do n't completely get the fslock code , but ship it i guess
it has been installed just now . i dont know the tool , checking web
hibernate is n't supported on all machines though
those folders are rarely in $ path
it 's indeed for the maximumwidth in the textarea , and it seems to work ?
is that possible on aws ? how would i get access to fail safe remotely ?
have you logged in again ?
support in this channel only please
ah - well
yeah that package in the ppa was built feb 18th , it 's very old . conflicting package uploaded feb
okay , so , as we just discussed up there , for all of those , the correct action is
importantly , do n't do anything else between the two dmesg 's : )
i just updated the bug with what i 've found ( sans solution )
r=me
for being awake on a monday morning ? ; - )
eh , android has plenty of things that are long-press or dnd , to use
check netstat -lntp , make sure it 's bound to a public ip address or *
looking at your review
and do any updated at all ?
did you check in a terminal the command : dmesg
hmm the llvm error : can not select : intrinsic % llvm.x86.sse41.pblendvb looks strange
and whats the issue ?
trying to avoid another delta to maintain
hmm take ~10-15 seconds . that normal i guess ?
have you just replugged it after looking it 's not shown in home
i did n't see what you were asking to do
its all in html5 and java script
okie dokie . none of the other differences are an issue ?
what is it you want from the js ?
but usually that does n't happen ?
if you were curious about the merge , for educational purposes , it 's in ppa : adconrad/ppa
in that case the property has3g should not appear
i 'm trying to use adt-run on emulator to run an autopilot test

just type rm -r , press space then drag
running nouveau driver atm
you have a choice a. ) use the ubuntu packages and let the package manager deal with it automatically b.
what about this line : setting api hostports
any reason you not staying on 14.04 if it worked ?
did you use bzr-buildpackage or debuild ?
did you upgrade to the latest kernel a dayt or 2 ago ?
it 's not possible to switch to the custom apn , the tick does n't move
/var/log/gdm
i 've been trying , not with much luck . i like to find the problem when i 'm debugging
so that 's where the ~100 new tests come from ?
i did ask you if you logged out and in again before checking ?
unity -- reset show warning and error
oh , you should take a look at snappy : )
the more the merrier ! : p
no upgrade , wily native
i 'd exclude by default , then again ; the staging terminology in snapcraft is confusing
that seems to be our last flaky qml test
do you have next-staging enabled ?
i 'll explain later .
no idea of the top of my head
we 're just espousing the conventional wisdom : md5sum check your isos , and then md5sum check your burned disk
shame about your versioning breaking the merge a bit , though .
is it possible you have something plugged into this system via usb that 's not important ? sometimes booting with

it should be specified in the uploaded package , no ?
i saw this , but i did n't see any similar command
do n't truncate : -p
perfect , thx
he needs the files , he keeps important things there
do you know if we 'll ever see this supported in the new thumbnailer service at some point ? bug
and the control file has the descriptions of the packages to make
and the tour in the docs is always accessible after installation too ( gridcube ^ )
it depends on what you do
urgh - that 's what i thought
if ubuntu it 's ubuntu-restricted-extras this includes codecs and ms fonts just so you know
thats almost impossible that syslog wouldnt see anything
scroll back
`` sudo apt-get -- reinstall install xserver-xorg '' - but where did it go ! ? !
for 2.0 , how can i render readme.rst easily ? to test see if my change is sane ?
yes , the security issues look like we should have them in an lts for sure
: )
are you going to backport it to 15.04 also ?

so by `` stuttering '' are you referring to to the repeated code snippets ?
try updating the archive with ah test file in /tmp/1k.file for example
no promises or anything . but looking through the last few times it was disabled , accidentally enabled , and
you think she is really singing ? sitting like that and having such control ... will let my wife watch
i am pretty sure you need the prop . driver for steam . maybe you installed that there too
as in the walkthrough screens ?
prima , danke !
nope
yep , makes sense
colord supports this sort of thing , as did kded4 . i had this working with oyranos and kubuntu 14.whatever
yeah , that 's probably best , otoh means double qa effort
with the -a i see eth0
hmm ... ok so is there a general usage ramdisk ?
i saw a comparison data sheet on do and linode , it seemed to me that do was better
ty
any tips on testing from the staging server ? and if any of the clicks have a bad hash still
yeah , i 've tested it , but i 've just confirmed that i see hspa in connectionmanager.bearer .
the timeout_style controls whether you see the delay countdown
if you have a high latency internet connection it wo n't use it to sync etc .
can run it self-hosted or as a service
i 'm just pushing this pr now
right right
johannesburg
as i just said : using nat , you can not connect from host to guest directly .
are you actually reading what i said ? i said i was done .
would you not ? !
oh i thought you said you get the screen straight away , nevermind then
awesome . you 've been of great help . i did some googling , and its not easy to find
\o/
could i replace server name with the ip address
i guessed and ran
nah , you 're also already using its ' kernel .
hmmm so you do n't have staging judging from the lack of uitk output
i strongly suggest you file a bug so the kernel team know that and can ship the patch with the
on personal people easily have 100 profiles
i guess all users can , it 's mounted rwx for others
so , i ask again , when you install main ubuntu 14.04 ? all is fine ? and when you
simply edit /etc/default/grub and add grub_gfxpayload_linux=text then re-run `` sudo update-grub '' .
pls paste sudo blkid instead
oh hmm , what version are you on ?
followed up to 1418262
but it does sound like bug 1425376 is back ?
but the spec is clearly ambiguous
{
unity is the desktop for ubuntu
it can , but not necessarily
explain that abit mate ?
yes , it depends on the cloud load and the network response for updates , an usual run can take
can autopilot run multiple apps and introspect the interaction ?
so you 'd be better off with a mount huh ?
unity -- reset-icons
i have no upload rights for them anyway
try # # windows ... this channel is for ubuntu support
i got the sources from the ppa , but you can just unpack the one in my home dir there
ls -l yields `` drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 apr 3 22:09 vm '' but still libvirt wont write to
that 's why i 'd prefer that datetime be fed a url rather than an id , so that the
i mean , try to boot without 'splash ' ... in text mode
tired of snow already ? : )
/etc/modprobe.d is not a file
if that argument is set , we 'll store it in a new field in the instancedata doc for the
but my impression from scrollback was just that he wanted somewhere to play without having to lock a silo .
where 's the wiki page on how you guys work ? what 's the process of working on blueprints ?
k sounds good . say hi to natefinch-afk ; he 'll be working on trying to repo the master blocker
what ?
that might be because the exec in your desktop file does n't have a % u on it
what is the command line you are using to edit the file
have n't tried it yet on rolling/edge bbb , maybe it solves the ipv4 issue too
does it keep an encrypted home fs mounted ?
i use gnome
but the clock still says utc and shows utc time
\o/
oh i did this before , because the installer does n't have a proper commit system and writes some changes
i purged linphone
please watch the profanity in here
re-read what i said above !
sure . i 'm also having trouble getting a 2nd cluster controller to talk to the existing regcntrl . this
as server , it never complains that it is out of space when installing..
upload the paste and give us the link please
`` the 4.4 kernel is the only one i got installed atm. '' and i cleaned already
possibly libmediascanner-2.0-dev
i happen to have an example of that
^
: )
understood
well , it is one as it 's the default repo
so , what 's next should i do a new silo with this and indicator-appmenu ?
`` ls -al /media/disk | pastebinit ''
thats on purpose
how is that different to [ dist- ] upgrade -- dry-run ?
do you have any experience with video stuff ?
nvm : )
no ! testers- # kubuntu-devel is < sed > /neo31/neo31 , vip/
yep , i 'm picking up where you left off : )
same on amd64 : (
oh , perhaps via uinput
for those , jenkaas is probably a solution , for *most* projects we just need some cpu
the new sdk ide does solve it
z4x f8* ( ) ? ^|
i 'm also getting no such file or directory on xorg.conf
do n't jinx it .
i 'm happy to have a look this evening
yeah , i already tried that approach , it did n't make my data available .
but back to the question : we dont know what kali installer can do or cant do . that is
if the hashes are insecurely transmitted the hashes can be edited too
that was on the rpi2
ok will do . and yes , i 'll test the redeploy after . backups first !
i do n't see `` connect to the network '' in yoru bug
can unetbootin do this ?
ah , ok . but i do n't understand , is the ppc restriction gone , or should it stay
will do : )
i uploaded it earlier - was that wrong ? : -/
so it should go into 1.25 and 1.26
nice , yeah
maybe if you do an `` fsck '' in a root terminal from the recovery menu
ok.. well in that case i did try that release , and the sound device had same issue back then
awesome
this is the ubuntu discussion room
backbox ?
why hostility ?
even a cheap pci card gpu can help if the board does n't have some kind of dedicated gpu
i guess : (
in trello
the pi-2 could be an option
what is sdb ?
lgtm ( though maybe in the future , we want the `` location : '' link in the header might
you told me too : p
i do n't think we 're going to agree here : )
good to hear
and none since the fresh install
logs are your friend
same here , i played tennis for over 2 hours yesterday evening ; - )
correct
yeah
doh !
what would you page out if you had enough ram to accomodate it ?
i 'd rather do in a separate one once we get the w open
i did , but it might not be completely right . no idea .
do you actually have an ecdsa key ?
well you might be idle to actionparsnip
but the /usr/bin/vim fails ?
yes press c and then type the destination where to copy to
ca n't be fixed easily , locally for you at least . to fix would need a developer have access
the ubuntu vm is running under xenserver
works too , just one of the router has to allow incoming ssh-connections ( port forwarding )
a p2 is*not* a modern laptop
correct
sorry , still a forbidden topic . try a different irc network
yes i installed the recommended driver in the driver manager
i did
take a look at lspci and lsusb to find out your wifi chipset .
i 'm using a 2gb ext2 /boot , lvm for the rest of that disk , with a separate /log
as long as you verified the pkgs installed ...
remove that one
no that was for another user .
and the relation is `` just there '' by right of the subordination ?
you meant that one comment with needs information ? : p
yes
yeah it was fine and working a few weeks ago
yup yup
basically something needs to say to the gui 'use the uuid ' or 'dont use the uuid '
not here , i use a large monitor/tv since this pc is my media /ht server
but again i have to run it from the last kernel ( linux padd 3.13.0-62-generic # 102-ubuntu smp tue aug
plus i just installed 14.04.3lts about 8.5hrs ago
to make any command a sudoer command , type sudo infront of it
check if you have proxies set in putty via the menu on the right hand side
is this a laptop or desktop ?
also please do n't crosspost .
i just got my m3800 . nice . the xps 13 is due for a refresh any day now .
its easy.. rebind control key on the outer one ; - )
or where is this check ?
use the one from partner repo
so it does not restart if it return nil from the loop ?
if i 'm honest , i ca n't remember
r , -- udfrev= udf-revision specify the udf revision to use . valid revisions are 0x0201 , 0x0200 , 0x0150
are n't you making /home /usr/local and /opt on 3 separate disks ?
it took me an hour to write the plugin with 100 % unit test code coverage , create the shout
wich ubuntu version is this ?
or if the silo happens to have a manual source , just put that one in packages_to_rebuild and it 'll
yep , there 's no ack needed , some ci train bug
all that really should be needed is boot/install/reboot smoketesting to make sure it did n't somehow regress horribly .
: )
that 's way longer tunraround . : p
no , you remove `` acpi=noirq `` from where-ever you have set it in that file
that 's possible of course , but i highly doubt it
since gb varient is used doest it mean that the spell check is working ?
i was sending my laptop in for repair so i stupidly removed all passwords
it will great to have that finally fixed .
depending on the program and hardware it can take seconds to hours ( hours is rare )
bug 1450243 is a blocker imo , the only way out is to reboot
nope
cd / ; du -sh *
so tell us what happens when you try to install ubuntu
so i 'm running watch_only build of 004 , do n't worry
so what 's your actual query ? i see you have a broadwell machine with an amd radeon hd 8890m
you are likely comparing different versions of ubuntu bases , like xubuntu 14.10 vs main ubuntu 14.04
i ca n't reproduce the dash issue either .
just indicates to check your creds
bad dvd burn . 4x max speed recommended
setting the scaling has to be done from unity scaling settings , not from gnome ones : )
second day playing with juju
train bypasses binary new queue , so we need prenew review
no where can i check that , tried it but i doesnt even light up
only in firefox ?
but i 'm kind of on the fence
press ctrl+alt+f1 , type sudo service lightdm restart
that is all i have to offer right now .
what gives you `` uname -a '' ?
i 'm in the kub . council
spanish , but my spanish is horrible .
taking a look
ah true
because nobody has done it yet .
that command 's output was : /dev/sdf6 on /media/ross/opensuse-13.2-dvd-x86_640051 type btrfs ( rw , nosuid , nodev , relatime ,
no , i 'm otp , but it 's going out the door tomorrow
as does the dialog . just the connection of the two might need adjusting
i 'm so used to typing out your nick really fast
well , i mean optimizing boot under systemd
well ; first i assumed it had come from the packages being updated , but then i twigged the version
you said from this you could see the data size , where are you seeing that
i can not get a hold of wayne , that is why i ask
also , how 's the release going ?
lgtm
3h battery life
annotations tags are about to be backported to 1.22 ; )
sorry , i misread your last msg
by looking at the cache portion of free -m , which said `` about 13gb '' . with a total
why do n't you do a `` normal '' install to a hard disk
do you know if/when they will land and be released ?
what are you speaking on ?
sec lem me ask
hmm , when i run those commands it does n't list any music albums : /
err , i 'd have to check
probably
ok , cool . will try in a bit
actually notifications mostly are interesting when the state is low ; )
o/ morning
i actually came here for help on an issue ( several ) : ( 1 ) my backup device seems
how did you uninstall it ?
do you have the vpn set up ?
i just told you earlier . by doing dhclient -r and then dhclient .
no , a symlink wo n't work
so the first thing you can do is `` ls /dev/mapper/ '' to see if there is anything there other
in a monitor.conf file ? \
in vivid we can . but in older releases that does n't exist so is no good for backports .
okay , i 'm looking into this long boot issue which is more pressing and will reinstall the silo afterward
what part of `` programming bug '' is unclear , we ca n't do anything about that , you got
ack
seems you have space for a 960 or 970 .
let me see ...
uhhhhh .. the times they are achange'n ! .. all that from the comfort of the sofa !
g'mornin '
i 'll go to # openbox then .
besides , it 's silly to ask . hardware varies . mine is not yours .
the 'route ' command . thoush it 's more modern to use the 'ip ' command , which replaces a
lem me verify , i am surprised .
in a pure linux environment you may use nfs or maybe sshfs
we received reports that ec2 was working in china with the last version of juju
but are we assuming this api will only be called where the environ does support address allocation
i know that vbox doesnt create windows shares . it never did , and it doesnt .
into the levelpack
use cryptsetup with luksopen command to create a block device , then you mount that block device
same thing
a 1.22 branch should work fine for the charm repo
ok bye and good luck ; ; 0
no . ondemand actually helps reduce power consumption ( less heat )
hmm i see where you 're going
second , it 's taking a very long time to start indeed ; i suspect it may be broken somehow
ok , but ideally your fix has a test with an assertion after the close , so it never breaks
sil2100 done ! sorry for the inconvenience
guten morgen ! gut danke ! und dir ?
ethernet plugged in did n't seem to let me get wedm.local either ( and i rebooted the bbb )
do you know when the phone adopted s-i 3.0 ? it was on 2.5.1 for a long while . is
ok yes i might need a hand at least to brainstorm
yes
it was when i was trying to make a new usb boot path cuz teh old oen is gone
in gparted menu , partition , new partition table
you can use quickstart if you have the juju-quickstart package installed
ok , what happened then ?
sweet !
yes
do you use testing frameworks at all ?
np , it 's worth a shot i guess
can you do `` pastebinit < ( tail -n 50 /var/log/kern.log ) ''
ah no , sorry no , it 's just a different bugfix
yes
also , potfiles were updated too in the branch you needreviewed
but building the .so for the different architectures is something that has to be done outside my project right ?
you do ? talk to blueskaj .
perhaps the associated package did n't install properly .
o_o
the next lts release is 16.04 , which comes out in april . it is supported for 5 years .
the same premise is true a. ) fix the problem b. ) ignore the messages
befire we remove.re-install.. in this present driver install , did you run - > sudo amdconfig -- initial < -
you do not run things with sudo when you are root , and you do not run browsers as root
when prompted , i decline the offer to do the chainloading stuff , i guess . and that 's it
people complaining about fonts or characters or colors that do n't look good in some esoteric terminal application
purge it
are those 2 commands , meaning i have to copy up to the `` ; '' and then execute the

wich ubuntu version ?
you do n't get any stacktrace ? or the stacktrace is useless - no valid frames ?

those are installed
it will teach you bad lessons and make your setup more complex than it needs to be
that 's the binary name
what version of ubuntu-device-flash is that ?
it 's really pathetic . luckily the replacement is really close ; - )
lowering loglevel perhaps , or lowering level logged by syslog

using logrotate , you can rotate all the logs you want .
you could also run go fmt as a precommit hook

lubuntu is a flavor
check `` dmesg '' and `` syslog '' output for more info related to wifi please
what says section device ?
indeed , the name=systemd cgroup is not owned by the user
thx
you could check your sources.list to see if it is using the correct repos
boot the live session , let 's see what you have for grub .
yeah definitely something is odd
yep , will do
that command is a bad move
is this what they danced to in the mask ? ! = )
so you got the popup with the pin ?
no problem , was just making sure i was n't missing important things you guys had already hashed out .
yeah i bet a version mismatch somewhere
shush you , it 's a perk
but then video is black
no quite , that changed in 12.04 , it 's now : sudo apt-get install package-name : i386 and multi-lib

no problem , try uefi

no

i would start from there , see if acpi issues are less

i really do n't think i have 2 soundcards , though .
ho , , dont ask .
oaky , it 's got nothing to do with the daily builds ?
root @ ubuntu : / # type usermod -ag sudo chucky usermod is /usr/sbin/usermod bash : type : -ag :
the same applies for your command , since mine is more generic .
would it also just remove the character
that 's what i was wondering . afaik nothing pulled valac-0.26 in so there must be some sort of override
i do not seem to have a add text menu
i 'm not looking for you to run that
yeah
i was misreading your post . i guess you should configure the xserver to load your resolution as default .
was that to me ?
let me check that
type locale in a terminal to get the list
that could do it
what do the checkboxes do ?
there is no problem having multiple des installed on ubuntu .
10x alot
i never assume that which i am interacting with is intelligent

odd thing is that , if you accidentally click on `` clear known indicators '' .. you 're screwed .

sil2100 : is this enough to run the job without the a10checklicenseheaders hook ?

just apt-get upgrade
downloading prop drivers from nvidia now

could you just remove the hook for the tests ?
ah - maybe renamed without the wm
and possibly we do a few subsequent txns on them to bump those up further ?
did the reinstall get the wifi working ?
yes , in the middle of taking care of it : )
sounds like quite the setup
have you tried `` ssh -vvv '' and carefully watched what happens when you ssh ?
weird , the dashboard shows it
ok , how did you install ubuntu , just as usual , nothing more ?
cheers - and please add a card for it and move your other one once merged
as far as i know my motherboard does n't support efi

i know it is pretty subjective , i have been using ubuntu for months and i like it , but
good point , can you file a bug ?
any explosions ? i landed a branch a few hours ago but it was fairly simple
the only thing needed for subnetinfo that it does n't keep is the availability zone information

yeah , that 's a bit crappy and needs fixing at some point
well , my machine suffers from the suspend/wake issues that seemingly have n't been solved yet

i feel i am more likely to replace it due to performance/size before death of cells , so i am
i have n't had time to think of the proper fix yet and still have more review to do
err , why would you blacklist the package you want installed ?
ok , i 'll ask jam if he has them
i 'm trying , but i 'm having trouble getting everything working . i got subversion working , but i
you ca n't expect people to spend time helping you with important details such as the error message being given
sure , please do then and poke me : )
was it dpkg asking for the config or that application ?
stunt
i 'll file the bug
oh , did n't realize that . then i 'm not so concerned about landing it but lets check arale
that 's fine . it 's going out probably around 5pm est
it probably does since you 're changing the scrollbars
why do you want a separate /home/ partition ?

there was discussions before abount having latest nvidia drivers available as default
and pastebinit ... ... /60-lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf

pitti.. how would you solve this ? generally like i am trying it ?
i was with 14.04 lts and some drivers are not ok with my laptop model . so upgraded to 15.04

it 's only a rough guide anyway , may not be a sensible starting point in this case ( delta

you should edit /etc/default/grub or /etc/grub.d/

you could try getting the linux-headers package or at least try reinstalling the bcmwl-kernel-source package

that is still supported : ) maybe change the mirror

no , it 's not , it 's in artifacts.tar.gz
yeah i have to remember we 're in busybox lol
anyway the delta is small enough that i would be fine backporting the remaining changes in another landing

when you open qtcreator , you will see a page called ubuntu-sdk
the popover tests passes partly but one of them closes instantly
it seems to me the fix is that content hub needs to detect when it 's gone away and restart

i checked with thunderbird configuration , and it says that cock.li should expect plain auth for mail
i should really have done that

you can hack it uop

if you really need that program you should consider virtualising windows on top of ubuntu with virtuabox .

atleast i made tracker support optional , it does require various other grilo-plugins as mentioned in the mir
i got that fixed with the bios update and a patch
and this libstdc++-4.8-dev ?
why did you look at the generated package.yaml ? how often do you think devs do that ?
well your mistake is mounting whilst you 're root =|
yeah , you can copy another .desktop file to use as a template

i get back to the desktop , fixed

rather exciting ,
i have a feeling what you advised is going to be exactly the fix i am looking for ... for
lts long term support , more stuff works with it
oh , yes . sorry : )
the output of either can be changed , its software
because that thing broken my kernel in the past as well
does n't work to share from the store - see above converation : (
i do n't think you have read that . read it .
done ^
but the problem is with auto importing
great ! \o/
we 'd be happy to accept a patch in to cloud-init for this , if you wanted to try that
cool ! weird bug ; )
was the yes directed at my question regarding crontab ?
in seriousness ... i have a fairly old ubuntu install on here as my main productivity os , as well
yes .
let me try by ip
yeah , that would be better imo .
ahhhh !
yeah so address-book-service is in -proposed , i 'm assuming another silo already published and has n't merged yet .
the file path to the image has to be exact
and for that trigger part refer to your conversation with adsb
i do n't think virtualenv allows for that
can you login to unity , just for the install and driver switch ?
oh , damn
well , anyway , i 'm trying to build and install openssh from source
this is the best place , no specific curtin channel
i 'm wondering if there 's something wrong with your flash drive ...
dont use this channel for network questions
then guess we need another round of releases
their is usually an identifable led sequence to identify the modes , check the manual
out of curiosity did you install 15.04 fresh or did you update from an older version
and yes , 904 is trivial . the only that would beat it , would a punctuation/typo correction ; d
no . pptp is thoroughly broken .
did that last time as well , did n't seem to have been a biggy
i 'd appreciate if you opened a bug on the qt bug tracker *without* asking for a revert , as
i see , i guess users can install one of the click store apps then ; - )
it does
why would you do that ? nfs is natively supported ...
i will give the permissions for readthedocs as well so that you can rebuild the docs on the website whenever
try modprobe from another terminal , then try the apt-get install again from the chroot
phew ... the changes are pretty huge ... i 'm trying to get my head wrapped around it ...
and plus you should the same check on icon , because some sites ( including gmail ) update the icon
ask # ubuntu-touch
ok everything is fine
is there just really 1 silo ready for qa in bileto ?
is it on lvm , encrypted or other gotchas ?
that is where we are at at the moment
as you said i probably did n't commit changes
run sudo apt-get remove nvidia-340
*
yes , so long as there are other side effects to ensure the code was called
sort of . : /
you . are not . answering my question
oh , and yes , utopic is eol : )
like the runner_test.go:134 : runnersuite.testoneworkerstartwhenstopping one
local
to cd into ...
what 's up ?
i 'm working on a project that 's effectively a specialized version of xubuntu with tweaks to run very well
they do n't usually carry the name of the application
+admin is generally staff only .
you can also use the analyze part of qtcreator then that 'll give you the frame rate if you click
i 'm sick but looking here from time to time
is it the plan to list things like dependency changes and such in there ? ( tbh listing added/removed files
should have told them to proxy buy you a beer for poor didrocks !
so given the new enough util-linux with that toggle enabled , can the /etc/mtab symlink be dropped ?
that json query does n't give me any results
you read my comment on the bug , did n't you < wink >
tonnes of guides online
yeah , it seems subsonic is failing to read .
but result is the same , : (
no
pretty sure you 'll like the net result though
( although as i mentioned it does n't read very well )
it probably does n't matter most of the time
i.e . pool , size , count
i can do that - what list should i send them to ?
`` used to '' , i.e . not anymore
what file system is the mount ?
afaik the duration is read from mp3 tags or some such , may not be precise ?
yea exactly
it used to update them on the fly
please add 9 extra bits
i 've seen it after the third or four
consistantly ?
no
it already has a prerequisite
also off topic : )
depends on the programs and if its system wide or not
i can access all my data and my lv 's are displayed well
is it bluez5 btw ?
ok. it stopped now
well what would i give if snappy was using upstart : d
does it sleep ? did you enable hibernate ?
no
yep
trevinho : do you want still me to try to manually call the ungrabaccel ( i 'm unsure about the
: - )
pycharm and webcharm from jetbrains
well , my charm will eventually needs it , so having a placeholder for the time being is fine
irc team does n't really `` approve '' team channels , so i figure that 's something you 'd want
okies script running now
no let 's not wait for user testing ... design will review the mp and sign off or not on
if you only rarely will remove the ubuntu hdd , you could switch the files , and when you want
push it
did you sudo
yep
you ca n't do it with webdm ?
that sucks , i had no idea it was n't working .
how are you doing that ?
you have a static or dynamic ip ?
if you can do the landing dance would be nice : - )
just so you know though , the best way to learn website administration is to do it manually - not
not an option because my wife uses windows 10 : (
ok but you are connected to the internet otherwise you wouldnt be talking here right
i can not downgrade libunity-scopes3
do you have mobile data enabled ?
monday ?
just talking about testing for the log rotation stuff . it requires more of the real workings of juju to
and send those out from the watcher
sergiusens : so it 's the same bug ^
but in terms of being available for install using apt etc ?
there is no proof ... the trust is based on what you tell us , and since you told us
i kind of wish i was on your team hacking this , this is how much i want this to
like the setup.py , install.sh , etc . etc
ok , no worries
ok : ) i just have paranoid highlights
ok . i 'm going to ask this question again . did you configure encryption while you were initially installing
is there a better way than manually constructing them as bson.d { ... } and doing the insert ?
lspci | grep vga
maybe , maybe not - this is my troubleshooting suggestion
disable in the bios
do you run it headless ?
actually i have no choice to use a folder , because the root is restricted .
ok , something happened and the row had an invalid uid
no , that was taken away so that gles twins always build with same version numbers .
how exactly did you upgrade to 14.04 ?
still thinking about the documentation thing ... . it occurred to me that unit numbering is going to go through
no problem
wich ubuntu are you on now ?
you need sudo for that though
what do you actually want from me ?
that command rings a bell ... i 've done it before , leme check again
are you working on the bug already ? shall i add a stop-gap index.html for you , where you can
it has not released yet , so not so active then main channel
welcome : )
so , 'foo ' ok , but 'foo/bar ' , no
python /usr/share/libmuon/applicationsbackend/releasechecker ; echo $ ?
ca n't we cast the interface to the concrete type using reflection ?
yeah , let 's revert that commit and bzr push -- override to the branch
or just use the windows cd to write the mbr after you uninstall ubuntu
err , what for ?
oh , right
it is just one command . : )
installing mavericks definitely rings large alarm bells
ta .
then do n't complain
do you have a hidpi screen ?
ok , does sudo apt-get autoremove remove them ?
heh , nice . is it a actual key or a string like `` garrrrr , kthxbye '' ) ?
ha ! i blame libudev
or better still scrabble
he commented
you can expect issues running testing versions..
the rest we need someone who knows more
and do setup sbuild , it takes around 10 minutes , just follow the wiki instructions
temporary deactivating ? use text as boot parameter
sounds like you should have your friend submit some patches xd
did you read the packagename i just triggered to you ?
it is amazing what problems are cause over very small amounts of money
oh , of course , but sandbox testing ... : p
in any case , should we really have that many items ?
yup , that 's what i was just doing . : )
yeah , snappy config ubuntu-core
please do n't dcc me . and no , the server is for my rl friends . sorry . i
yeah : )
cool . might be worth bearing in mind .
no man
upstream does have systemd units , yes ; but our package only has an upstart job , so it does
if you get that version of pip and then do
memoserv requires logging in what to do ?
how is installing packages related to pinging an ip
the framework has to expose that via its framework policy
log where ?
stop making assumptions
it prints something
app ...
have you installed the guest additions services ?
oui , et toi ?
another user on that system besides guest account ?
one could argue , that the functionality of dh-systemd should be merged into dh_installinit , but at the time ,
cool it with your poor advice
alrighty , i 'll upload that one after all of xfce
or even just 'charm upload -- publish . ' to both upload it to dev and publish it in one
how are you using php anyway ? fcgi ? fpm ?
well i do , i like nice urls : )
could it be that `` ./amd64.. '' would help there ?
yes , in german.. kartoffelkloesse ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
geez , really ?
in italy the first day of the week is sunday
got it . it might be nicer to actually excercise that d.router.notfoundhandler instead of just checking the references .
btw , i got problem accessing /job/-0-reconfigure/parambuild . reason : not found ( 404 )
good flights ? : )
we definitely need exponential backoff in our ec2 api with automatic retries . is it supposed to have it already
i in fact did , yes . all was good . turns out it 's not /etc/lightdm/ anymore , by
hey , that 's always what i *want* to hear : p
sure that 'd be fine and much appreciated . loicm is n't quite ready to submit it upstream as he
that returns nothing
excelent , congrats on graduation ? ( will you do a blog post ? )
when it did n't work in non root so i changed to root
what does it tell you exactly ?
if you cp the b kernel to the a partition , does it work then ( make a backup of
i 'll advise the user to poke -devel or -motu next time about it , since bug control does n't
over my head . # # android would know more
it uses blink as a base and adds bits on top , i doubt anyone else does something like that
what question you mean exactly ?
i 'm hoping he 's wrong on that . if he is n't , i 'll need a dbus log
its all important , otherwise the people who make the sound subsystem in your os wouldnt have the text as
so , just maintaining the 'pass host/build to configure ' bit should be simple enough , but someone should probably
sorry ...
anything can land , the landing gates are open : )
but hmm ... if we 're going to move to 1.3 for ota8 , we probably should get those fixed
i realize this
been working on this for a couple hours now . has to be the -54 kernel .
i dont have any single tracks
sorry , gnome-bluetooth was a typo for g-c-c
the tasks are intended to be 3-5 hours each
what ppas , what packages and what chroots do you use ?
i am using several irc clients
that referring to /usr/ binaries needs a path to there set , and even if it is it could sometimes
okay , great .
if semantically -5.6 takes over an existing db and just continues working , of course
its an oldie , ... i have to re mr it
farnborough
it has sftp
before that it says featurefreeze
have a look at my `` syncthing '' app in the store , which runs in the background and has
maybe the data files .
use vlc package
it 's not there
so it will just not work when you install that oem with stable channel ?
that being said , you are looking for # ubuntu.txt for raw text , or # ubuntu.html for prettified stuff
cat /etc/fstab | nc termbin.com 9999
does make it hard to order enough food
the folder lightdm is empty just one file in users.conf
never used kde , check google must be a easy
we discussed that one earlier today
which windows version was the ntfs volume created with ?
ok , type dpkg -l fglrx-amdcccle | grep /bin
here you 'll get an updated package for your help : mivoligo : ah great . i 've enabled full
i do n't think cocoa and cocs2d are the same
too bad : )
@ 75 ? good god , crt ?
it is not skype - it is the network
it did update but i ca n't seem to upgrade the mentioned contacts sync db
what happened with your packaging ? i know we were talking about that last week . aside from me/steve did
its value is set to 10
the guide on the page is n't literal , the version # is different
cool man sounds good
is that thing about not being able to delete the security groups relevant ? just got that again
finished
how 'd you do that ?
i suspect the problem might also be in people receiving the notification last week already
i will . sorry , been busting my butt , but there was a lot more to the merge than
i find moutains are good as well .
kde is optional
yeah , i had to think a bit about that
right , we 're ganging up on you ...
ok , my teams mess thos
fine , i guess
ok so we will pretty much land everythign both places from what i undestand
should he do the memtest ?
type exit , then restart the pc
so i just see that the firs time i go to cellular settings i always see technology=2g , which is
it 's fully unit tested , the only thing that is n't is wrapper that gets exec 'd by url-dispatcher
sorry , in a meeting
what else is there to try ?
right , if we ca n't test it on the phone , it can land
and then that takes you to all settings - > appearance , so you could then click on where it
it 'd b amazing !
whatever irc client you 're using right now , you can type ( without quotes ) `` /join # #
log out means , log out of system or just close the shell ?
please read my question , it 's an ubuntu phone
sigh , stop sending cryptic messages : p
try /join # gambas
oh right , so we can move it to whever it makes most sense and then upstream it to debian
the reason was mostly that `` this was n't good for compiz 's upstream ''
but the paths and packages change
ok , works , /me validates then
yes
ps aux|grep ibus
grep -r guest /etc seems like apparmor is used to restrict stuff
will do
look at your own dmesg paste .
yes . no code changes
more than likely you picked the wrong lan ip / forwarded a port wrong / your isp blocks it
target for what ? the efi partition ?
i get a black screen with a msg .. ( ee ) server terminated with error ( 1 ) .
any ideas how i can uninstall komodo ide 9

these last two days on the laptop keyboard have been awful .. anytime we have sprints and people watch me

can i help further ?
ok try xargs -a 514n sudo apt-get -y install -- reinstall
maybe just ditch the apt-get version and build from source and use that ?
but glad you have a non-hybrid to test on for now . : p
let it working all the time at the highest frequency
the fix was cc 'd to upstream stable , so it 's eventually going to make it 's way into
the fix for the above bug was necessary because of the big backend end change that landed in uitk 1.2
that will output sensitive info , so redact if you post it somewhere
datetime.isoformat ( )
that sucks a lot
ah , custom apn
now you 're mounting the virtual filesystems from the liveusb to the mounted installation
windows is not a good choice : - )
bug # 1427439 comment 9 has steps to reproduce the issue , but i have n't been able to get
all we heard was that you have a serial touch screen , but nothing else
yea thats next step but figured itd be super weird for the s3 mirrors to have an issue
norwegian dep-wait ( desktop )
sounds like your cert has been signed with an untrusted ca
so my pc recognizes two 9 buttons
yes eah5750formula
yeah , i did n't know that was a thing !
ohhhh . so it might be too old to use the kernel 's ftrace tools ?
no , 11.2.x i mean : d
good , now lets check there is n't already an xorg.conf : `` ls -l /etc/x11/xorg.conf ''
what happened was that the lp people made it possible for us to create ppas dynamically , which is amazing
with the firmware installed it should work properly
the previous system created an ( encrypted ) swap partition ... right now there probably is n't one defined but
sorry i fail to see where it converts it to milli
did you get the other fixes ?
i expect lots of comments as it was a rushed post from my bash history , but yeah it works
hrmm ... so if a leader sets state x the followers will not see that right ?
something like 2gb will be freed

what version of ubuntu ...

5 segfaults in 5 separate executables
maybe that 's a good thing
i do n't see toykeeper having anything assigned on the trello
you 're trying to use upsart
not happening till i descide if ubuntu is going to run acceptably on this tablet first
no spoilers !
that has nothing to do with his server sending emails out . he 's not trying to receive email .

but for the time being let 's just keep it in mind ( probably add a card for it though
so do you have any flash , beside the chrome pepper built in ?
you have a passing result which ran after that failure

it 's just the normal file
well just to get you back up to date with functions and what have you
yes !
ace !
yeah , but read the subject of the email
you are interested in when gmail pops up ... not in normal ; )
yes
gmail , browse/lookup stuff , phone , gps
`` files ''
system apps and phonedations .
better use something like crashplan.com ( or something faster ? ) next time . a raid is n't backup .
k .
what was it ?
yeah found pepper to be the same in all browsers
it would 've given you a url to paste here
it did n't fail to start
those issues sound unrelated to an incorrect resolution , they sound like drivers have been messed up
any idea how i can identify if the interface is the hotspot ?
if you do a simple qml that loads that file , does it also fail ?
why not ? : )
ls again
i 've put it back at the same time . demo what you have , it 'll be great :
ask a question instead of repeating text
so it was a regression in 5.4.2 ?
well i 'll give it a try then , see what state it 's in ... it 's my only
whats the exact issue then
i see my soundcard with that command
did you have to install oem-config at any time ?
please do n't . this channel is for support only
i suspected that ken vandine is doing it in the `` pathwind '' game , but amazingly the whole thing
try esc+ # instead , or /win #
i 'm using the newer linux-firmware here ( i 'm juggling betweeb 3.19 and 4.2 )
we 've been working on incorporating your systemd patch into the new services approach
sorry , i 'm still working it out later after i 'm back , so it 's not that i
we 'd like to demonstrate the steps for the gui deployment , it is windows after all : p
so how do i get rid of it . it was an option when installing so i 'd think there
what software is used to map it out like that ?
put them in the store ?
yes , i can see that as the shell prompt
so if you are taking again some time for looking at this project , please unmerge them ( also ,
it 's not listed
howd you like it so far ?
these are my devices i was able to sort out . i hope that identification is enough . now i
sudo aptitude install vim-gnome installed it ; )
no ppa , everything goes straight into trunks and xenial
awesome : )
sorry davmor2 can not reply he is being choked , please leave a message after the tone , beeeeeeep
is it safe to do that with all of my config files ?
but do you think this could be a substantial change in terms of performance for my case ?
after a reboot the shutdown dialog appears here too .
mmm ... . the seed ... ? an mp ? ... . i 'll ask ross : )
or open a terminal and pastebin the output of `` xrandr -q '' for us
majority is n devices , yes .

i was never much of command line guy , is that too hard to learn . i mean , i
not always
i 'm a little concerned
we have to assume when we do n't get a full picture . i 've no idea on this one
there 's two things to check : ( 1 ) all reverse dependencies must be gone , and ( 2
use paste.ubuntu.com for pastes
sounds like your resolving is broken .
lines 149 and 150 .
just to double check ... you are changing the volume with the mouse wheel ?
from my sattelite card ?
i installed lubuntu once and i ended up running that to get unity back how the way it was
are you pulling it from the archive ? a ppa ? or , god help us , piping a shell
i 'm trying to build a home nas/media server . right now i have a hp compaq 6005 usdt that
ok , type sudo mkswap /dev/sda2
its a sort of emulation library/front end
if you 're running a pentium iii , i can see your gripe , then again , the glass is
vmware
fwiw the haproxy monitoring page is really useful to see the status
no , it 's a server
vmstat ; )
or keep it at 10 % sound .
i just did n't bother yet while the autopkgtest was broken as it 'll most likely require a new upload
it looks like 2 is my default runlevel ?
sure , was just wondering if there 's a solution : )
i did n't create the original bug . so , i 'll have to use apport-bug
all that stuff , symlinks

i heard that luke is actually anakin and is in fact his own father
what ubuntu install with what version of chrome ?
try 'riddell ' in # kubuntu-devel
do you understand something about sound ?
you can definitely pass a proxy login/passwordd
i 'll take a look at that . i thought i 'd fixed the top level thing . : /
yes i wo n't do a sub sided phone again
are you talking about qtmir windows ( shell windows ) or client/application windows inside desktopstage.qml ?
anything left for me to do before i take off ?
try maybe something simpler than gedit ? like gnome-calculator
he wants to use mtp to copy over files so that the users may start to play the files directly
i wonder if it will harm to add lines like im : ja : fcitx : fcitx-anthy
do you have another usb ?
i 'll keep rescanning it until it works .
that will confirm that squid is ok , then you can focus on the netfilters rules
permission denied on what ? logging in ?
somebody needs his morning coffee ? i 'm simply stating what i just did , and that it worked for
i 'm thinking we should just make it generic though ...
and using a 1.25 client with all the series version fixes should work ( that 's my theory )
sorry , port 9000 now i see . it was 9001 earlier though , could that be an issue ?
yeah , but my android phone already integrates nicely with exchange out of the box
somethings seems off with the libgit2 package
i 'm happy for us to look for a better solution
ah . did n't know there was another culprit : -p
people use that as well somewhere
or move it as the last item
it is on
just do that based on git , i 'm going to look at the package update and refreshing the other
you dont need the same level for learning by doing : )
yes , those are empty transitional packages
no
should n't we use uss ( rtm ) to track these landings in bugs ?
should i copy the functional test folder to the original source ?
yep , it 's broken ( and on my list )
ok , `` systemctl -- failed ''
static site generators are too technical for most plebs
same result
type=simple is also the default
okay , my turn for `` what are they thinking ? '' . someone saying node is too basic ,
not a huge thing , but we can fix indeed
or a question like trust this computer ?
me ? is that uname -a ?
deciding it should be somewhere else now does n't necessarily mean that the spec has to be changed like it
so now mark your task as complete on the google site and i can approve it
yup
but prororsed have new firefox , chromium and thunderbird . this apps i need for work and life .
any visa issues or is that all good ?
would you like to do that on -release ?

had more luck ?
i do . a lot of them . : d
it does n't matter
maybe he should just pick his own this time , well after guideing him in some sort of direction
hmm , no , it is showing me the time right ... i was looking at a wrong place ,
sounds like what i 've got here
it is normal for the software to contain bugs . i was just frustrated for not taking care of it
in root shell : usermod -ag root acidrain
that 's quite a few goroutines ...
probably cloud-init has the affected code .
when you login to the juju-gui is the openstack-dashboard charm green and have all green relations ?
i flushed those before starting the experimentation
very good , looks much better now .
worth a try , if you already have all the info you need
it would appear so ... this is unsually slow
no idea
allright , could you pastebin the output of 'sudo lspci -k|grep -a2 audio ' ?
oops , sorry for jumping over you : )
choose the one that fits your needs
ok
no .
we can do it with a life cycle or otherwise , but essentially a strings/notify watcher worker
sure . i 'll try this in my own env too
xrandr is how the monitors are controlled
sort of . icon themes inherit other themes .
right , i assume that is the boot-and-services test failure ?
13 + 8 now
and i believe they 're going to handle it
right , that 's what i would do for a normal charm . unsure about how different layers would combine
ok good . and i just poked into # openstack-nova to ask if they have a point release coming soon
that 's fine , send me the requirements and i can take care of them this evening
1.3 will have the snooze

also they are vertical
not really : )

did n't he create verisign ?
if i remember correctly , my kernel is vanilla and up-to-date , ubuntu 14.04
do tell !
did you get the list i sent you ? it said i left the room for excess flood
yeah . i can .
ok
ok. i just did :
i guess the failure is somehow related ?
where do i type /usr/bin/lighttable ?
however , that is n't the state of things at the moment so you 'll have to go the rebase-then-pr

sudo journalctl -u openvswitch_ovs-init-switch_0.1.service
how did you reinstall grub ?
ohh
possibly
there have been a few , but probably they are in different countries to you ; )
in windows ?
lol , i have n't owned/run a windows box since pre-xp_sp1 ...
it 's instance id that is created later
so is it gon na be steam time to try some games ? ; )
... is it still a desktop without ? : p
service -- status-all is for sysvinit managed daemons . the ones managed by upstart can be seen with : initctl
what 's the part of the wiki you wanted me to read
oh and `` cat /mnt/etc/issue ''
it does ? makefile.am does n't mention that and gtk-launch.c has a lot of # ifdef g_os_unix
reinstalling with it disabled would probably fix it .
well that depends on the release team right ? since it upgrades main packages ( bluez and pulseaudio )
oh okay . will try check there then .
install the fglrx from the repo and then see the amd control center thingy
yeah
we pinged you ...
yes , and it breaks shit for users all the time
shoudl work in 14.10
and ... why xfce4-power-manager is ignored ? : (
but never tested on chromebook myself
i can find 0 bugs in the bug tracker regarding this
i just put it in /etc/cron.daily or whatever ?
poking !
virtualbox and vagrant init
i have n't used the arguments type yet ; i 'm just printing out the actual arguments that are passed
not yet , got carried on other things , i 'm just probably going to set a width of 60
is there a list of all the usb drivers somewhere ?
i guess some chipset support is needed
i have no idea ! it worked , now it does n't
if i boot back into the other installation can you help me further with this ? i really have no
is it working for you ?
to you ?
yes : ) the hellochangsha
is /var expected to be nfs-mountable ?
nice : )
and how far can you go without breaking updates etc ?
hehe i guess
maybe 16.04

davidcalle : fyi , the recent devportal deployment has given us the ability to add meta tags for page description
you should probably be able to use cpufrequtils .
yeah , this is breakage
it 's the price we pay for tracing
to be honest for non-qa people would n't a mail to the list once a week with total tests be
what exactly should i do ? fix it ? what application is that ? can i install it locally somehow
if you have experience you do n't necessarily need the degree
you could add it to /usr/local/bin

yeh thats what i read on the forums .
mailinglist or bugreport since its still in developing state
no another pc
ok , can you chase this up with # ubuntu-kernel ? if they declare it hopeless then i 'm happy
i 'm trying to install packages from that ppa on my device

even if i do n't really like how this acts , i 'm trying at least avoiding the confusion
nope
nope , but i removed ecryptfs
you do n't have to keep it in sync . it only has to work with your snap writable areas
ok , the efi file is there
i just looked at the grub source and the error is reported in relocator.c , so it seems like it
give me 5 more minutes
like lxde
the file actually does n't show up in the ubuntu file manager
ktux is still no go right ?
the problem was that tcpdump was behaving strange , but not when in my home directory .

tried rebooting yet ?

i have a few hdds not running at that speed .
got anything ?

great !
wish i had the arguments to use ... the kits sure are not helping .
so outside of trim , does it do anything else ? or is it up to the ssd to do
the cause is that the files are what 's known as 'conffiles ' and if you make any changes the

on another note , i see that corosync migrated to vivid earlier . is there any further testing you think
the dict solution is nice .
none of that is in the flavour packagesets though
how can you send a message to my , with my name on it , and then when it appears
just ask whatever question you want , as long as it is on topic here
no
hi starts in 13 minutes .
i can do wily master-next as well
i would simply look for and apply updates and reboot and test
the license there says we must copy the copyright for the binary distribution
i am also running that on a fresh install
sharing some output via paste.ubuntu.com would be a good start
fglrx does n't seem to fail here with 4.2
riddell and the kc were both sent similar emails at the same time
yes but i thought you might like to know : )
linux exists since 1993 haha : p
from the two logs shared above ... one uses cmake 3.02 the newer one that fails seems to use cmake
if the fix of those failures are trivial then of course i will push the fix
relatively
afaik , it 's not in the spec . so maybe that answers the question

what languages are listed when you open gnome-language-selector

you 're installing server edition on a user 's machine ?
can we undo this , and publish again to the ppa ?
this might be because you are installing the same version over other ?
i never did have success getting an arm64 vm going to poke around
if your change just deleted extraneous dependencies , then that was kinda flawed ... : )
i had clock app open and changed the timezone manually .. and alarm can be enabled/disabled without any crash
done
no no , you did n't do what i said above

where do i install it from ?
that is the next example i 'm gon na work on

how to use it ?
it can call `` snappy config '' for every app

vivid should work fine though . we have n't changed the aosp base for the vivid builds
i actually like the new design ( top left one )

if the tools install fails , use this command to install the necessary files : sudo apt-get install linux-headers- $

so for me you would use vis or print_tree to dump the application and explore the object you want .
not a problem : )
if you do that - it will remove any data in that partition - all 68gb
it also shows adding a ppa
the name has changed , use inxi -f to find the new name
open the laptop back with the screws and check if its dirty ?
oh that 's different than the last one
waow , sounds a nice `` easy '' way to get it , let 's cross fingers
geforce gt 730m ?
i keep the ubuntu delta in the ubuntu branch , but it just keeps getting rebased
the liboxideqt-qmlplugin 1.9.5-0ubuntu1 version is available in xenial
if you have installed the proprietary drivers , and a custom xorg.conf is in place , still , which ,
it is on there already
previous and current employers use them , i was happier with zunicore and linode honestly
if you start typing quod does it show up ?
haha , yes , i wanted to see if a 'normal ' laptop resumes quickly or also takes a few
ok , maybe
and then i 'll start bisecting individual /lib/systemd/systemd-* binaries
how many times will it retry ?
so i have to reboot again to see the login page ?
the way you showed up installs more recent software then adding the xorg edgers ppa and doing an apt-get update

note that that machine is hardly `` low ram '' . it 's 16g , but yeah , also 32-bit
'cgdisk ' and 'sgdisk ' are close cousins of 'gdisk ' but are targeted at scripted or text-based curses windowing
basically it returns true if the file ends up in the place you expected it to be

for sure : ) i 'll need half a day for that systemd bug fix with `` systemctl link ''
what download ?
right , this is intended more for existing desktop apps ( chrome , libreoffice , ... )
partly . does n't mean they share repos
i can do that in some time
great work !

yup ?
or you can stay 9months and file some bugs , up to you
eventually we will do per-instance ( including containers ) firewalling - and setup routing rules so that spaces are isolated
yeah you would think so but not in my case
so , next i 'll figure out why the session crashes right away

it works after installing the new ubuntu-snappy on my laptop
i said try live
great , yes i was new to it too , yes these native macros are better
i 'm filing a new bug for that
so whats the issue with that ?
i did $ snappy-remote install -- url=ssh : //webdm.local or something
is that image any different than yesterday 's final test release ?
question is , think is something we should spend time investigating deeper or just approve your code and be done

the agent wo n't restart ... a worker is failing to stop
oh
oh ?
generally i expect nvidia-prime to install when the 346 driver is installed . nvidia-prime permits changing to the intel driver
it also implements an x server , so you get a whole desktop + session rather than a particular program
so looks like we have a release now
do you have my cell number ?
and the fix was proposed last week ... anyway i 'll stop complaining
probably a good idea . there are also tons of online resources to learn ( x86 ) assembly .
that makes sense , the linux kernel rather writes to ram and then to disk . to make data copying
yeah , it looks like i *can*induce failures , but i 'm not seeing the one you mentioned above
precise still gets new builds , since it 's still supported afaik
not until you unlock it , are you even paying attention ?
do u have an idea ?
then please do n't , it 's not helpful
'startup applications ' only run after login . what you need is some init script ( or systemd ? !
are you using uefi ?
the tar is n't being stored in a file , it 's sent over the network ...

and since all of ubuntu will eventually move to snappy that means you can use snappy server or desktop packages

whats the make/model of the pc ?
i kinda am . if you 're free , i 'd be happy to get a helping hand with this
i like that it fits in with the worker framework too
yeh
unfortunately not : (
ok , and that 's not in your wheelhouse , fair enough , but who is working on fixing it
if it works in ubuntu , you 've probably partitioned it correctly
is that happening on your host system ? because apt should have created that user on upgrade
heh . well , we 'll cross that bridge if we 're ever forced onto it . was more making
ok
maybe ? this is n't even in the spec . hidden in a gdoc somewhere : | i 'll add
you can also pick the entry on the boot menu of efi or legacy

did valorie get you involved in kubuntu ?
`` ./run.sh '' uses the proper stuff , but not `` ./run.sh -f ''
do you see yourself helping other devs with ui and icon designs ?
what is your website about ?
some of this may boil down to differences in 32 vs 64-bit files -- your os is 64 , right
what i try to do is to get a minimal ubuntu install without any desktop

so you put them back to `` in progress '' ?
k
i sent a short one to rsalveti to start discussing during the architecture meetings
it 's a command
it does if you want more than 2 clients
what else did you do ?
good to be back : )
ok , that sounds like an agreement - i 'll come up with some code for that
np , usually this happens when people use ppas but you are using the official packages
but i mean i do n't think they parallelize at all
i mean for the refresh interval to test it is actually refreshing
are you gon na show us the requested info then ? what about : `` sudo apt-get install pastebinit &

are these fixed in wily ?
and then we will look at moving forward to proper leader election .
wrt lspci , ls /sys/bus/pci/devices might be a good place to start
see maaz ^^^
well definitely report the bug about not being able to file a bug , but what 's the bug you
the rest of the channel does n't know your problem ; )
will be a pleasure
: - )
okay
that 's terrible ... where is dmesg ?
no
i am not really too sure but i figured if you had n't tried that route yet you may be
i know the feeling : d
when was that ?
ok reboot
hehe
the only statement that has ever been made is that it will be ready by the 16.04 release

that 's the same command i entered , and it does n't recognize the -- now option .
needing reviews ?
after this i could boot to an old kernel on failed system

aha : )
what is our solution there ?
i was involved in other conversation : )
nope , it 's a desktop gpu with no optimus capabilities
so.. if you want the least bugs , as opposed to the latest and newest , 14.04 might fit the
yeah . my touchpad doens't work in lts . it only works in kernels > = 4.2.6
but it says it has an `` install '' feature !
aiui , ufw provides a way to create iptable entries in a way that is simpler than issuing iptable commands
if you 've allocated /dev/mapper/ubuntu-home to the /home mountpoint it should be ready , press the `` install now ''
i 'm happy to continue our conversation about what we should recommend . i 'd rather focus on that ,
anyway back to installing your debug packages ... ..
lgtm
but buying a gaming sort of laptop then running ubuntu ... seems backwards to me : )
but to skip all that , firefox alone works . sleep 8 ; firefox does n't work .
the package manager will pull the latest in your repo list .

no big deal then , repropose and rebuild

but it technically should work
`` sudo service networking restart `` , just for good measure
it 's just work : )
we do n't go through the wifi wizard properly
yes , that is the idea of activities . virtual desktops are meant to be related in task , activities
the problem is that all the `` interesting things '' happen before we return an instance back from startinstance

there is no current supported release `` 21-may-2011 08:06 `` i am hesitant to say a means .
yeah , but there was a bug opened asking to reset that then unplugging the headphones
that would be also a trick to handle that space indeed
cool
ok. my /etc/network/interfaces contains just the defaults 2 lines of ubuntu ( networkmanager is not modifying this it seems )
but i take the point about github-style deployments that think package managers suck .
what 's the context ?
the menu is in the spreadsheet
you should be able to use the down arrow once
afaik that 's based on limitation of the cpu home is intended for ( x86 )

no
in 15.04 there is a tool called lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings

in practice , yes , but that tends to happen at a different level -- and it also tends to

do you have a short list of apps targeted for default inclusion in snappy desktop ? i know we brainstormed

yes ; mmm it 's very odd to see things fail so , what other options does it present ?
it 's going through files pretty fast , can lsof produce a list as it 's going through them ?
in case you 're helping him
aha , nice . let me see
have you tried installing 14.04.2 - it will give you a different kernel/x than a 14.04 install unless you change
but i suspect you are going to have issues with ubuntu-snappy-cli
in windows 8 it is better
i would propose the changes myself , but i ca n't really test if it helps for your use case

at the very least do n't entrust it with anything important
i have a few patches more for the qtdbus thing that should help , can you rebuild the silo ?
the branch now has new commits that were n't built in the silo
weird i did n't notice that was n't working .
no change : (
it is , because you 're asking if anyone has a problem similar to yours , which is n't relevant
and just today the author changed it so by default it builds kwallet5 and you have to ask for kwallet4
what languages do you think should be official ?

its what is done with bugs
infact it crashes the app i ca n't do anything now : (

no , as i mentioned before i have no idea what it does .
where 's the image you 're booting ?
can you check if you can restart your instance , it should be fixed
all that i have done is bzr branch lp : xubuntu-docs , changed the dozen or so files i changed

yep , it 's all in . there might be something to see regarding autopkgtest results before you 're off
see if the kernel headers are present ' ls -al /usr/src/ ' for the kernel you are booting ' uname

ack , so ignore for now ?
show me `` pastebinit /var/log/apt/history.log ''
if you have some examples of `` sending context over the relation '' it would be great
but then you keep processes like dhclient around which prevent proper unmounting of / and thus a clean shutdown
needs to be done as a separate transaction then
we should : )
there are ubuntu packages from steam.. xubuntu *is* ubuntu
is it not set to developermode by default ?
so what have you done to it ?
what ?
oh , do you think that should be the way forward ? to use uflash instead of u-d-f ?
i did n't say `` some '' ; )
it works ! ( cc davmor2 )
sweet
there are not applications to share with
mm
no , because you dist-upgraded
ah . gotcha . let us know if it works ; ) .
hmm strange . i 'll check if fedora is holding any patches that might affect this

yes . the application needs to connect to the change signal before reading the first value
yes , we can surely fine-tune that

one question , we originally landed in vivid+overlay , does it not have the same test ?

which logo ?
enjoy the movie : )
only two for win7 and then / , /home , swap for kde

unless you see something in what i pastebinned
thats what i meant
same here ... is there are problem ?
is it reproduce able on desktop ?

if writingboilerplate for a tiny subclass is an option for the moment , here 's an example of how it

the *agent* should n't know anything about the environ
so now when building the mainline kernel the line should look like : fakeroot debian/rules binary-headers binary-generic do_extras_package=false ?
kind of
ahhh , digital restrictions management code , for windows applications it looks like
yes krillin
i can not because that will hide the critical blockers
i thought we reverted that in gcc . or did it get unreverted again ?
no , that got released there into rtm
by installing libunity-tools , you can run libunity-tool and launch the scope with it
ok. that btw should work because it pops up the dialog `` exporting '' but no onexportrequested triggered
whats in your sources.lst file ?
will tal in a bit

the ping to ookla is a n issue of the entire connection from your pc to that specific server .

and if you hold down the power button for > 10 seconds , nothing happens ?
uefi sound familiar ?
great work
not intentionally !
users get the time to upgrade , then a version will go end of life
there are not beta ubuntus currently supported .
there arent in out pairs in windows ... thats another difference ...
what did you find ?
okay , anyway the server seems to be up again
'talk ' in what way ?
wash the pink paint off your shades .
and fails on staging as well ! ! ! ! !
nice one !
can/should i install the package with nodeps , install the more recent dependency , and , well , see what
new
let me make a couple of steps for you .
erm , the count emblem
i am writing some tests now and then it is ready for t1mp to continue with the header
should be good , yeah !
do you let em sleep in your bed also : p
yes that will disable it on startup
i ca n't reproduce it here . with `` 1.2.3.4 , 5.6.7.8 '' added to the ipv4 nameserver text control
cheers , and feel free to estimate it as well
yes it is , i 've already unlocked the hdd with the passphrase to be accessible through the live instance
haha i actually was about to proxy those files : p
like what specifically ?
i am right
that 's what i 'm hoping to figure out .
ugh
huion is the brand.. i thought ... . it says huion right on the front and they have their own

and please never forget that the developers did n't even care to release btrfschk until about 2012
lol
relly sounds like wrong password they are cap sentive
ah , hang on , maybe more to it ... let me dig a little
yeah , i assume we have a lot of issues there now we have systemd fun to play with
yeah , though sphinx plugins are fairly painful to write .
hmmm , let me do something here
good , i 'm running the gnome3 ppa version since yesterday
you seem to be suffering of double shell with the same escape clause
.po files are different , do we care ?
ah , found the tests
there is no kernel source for that on ubuntu .
and yes , more unit tests there wo n't hurt
for now : )
note this is when switching scopes , not after the scope has switched
so generally , i would recommend waiting a little bit for the merge to get merged in automatically by the
it is the test linked above
np , let me know if it works : )
we use pygit2
the odds of clashing on the same physical segment with a real computer seem slim . ; )
btw it could be an option called csm
you just need an additional comma after the last param
yeah , did that on my laptop but i 'm building on a separate server these days
that way we can actually help you
you 're free to use the ip address to get to the machine you want .
let me check the production site
and good for me to know so as not to step on anyone 's toes .
maybe ...
perhaps make another user and use that one to launch the firefox session ?
lots of love for vivid , i am using it lol
i 've got an ubuntu vm running just fine on in virtualbox on 512mb ram , and 20 % of

good ! any link to such packages ( as there may be dependencies ) ?
as the big old finger is also slower
because a thread is being created that does something and then the thread exits
i can wait : - )
aws is amazon 's cloud where you have remote server and access to it via ssh . nothing more
not any more
and to convert back to a .db file i would run this right ?
well the pc is a stratus ftserver ( a real server ) that 's why i want ubuntu server .
there is this significant feedback item about how terse ( or , conversely , verbose ) my explanations are .
yes
palgrave : cool . thx . i did do some fishing on google and it seemed like it should n't
you do not , juju is happy running as a user . if it requiers elevated privs it will prompt

look with your good eye
i am dealing with azure instances being left behind after destroy env . and since the azure console does n't
but it also avoids a lot of code duplication between very similar charms
that is not a command
what command should i run to install then ?
what device ?
that 's archive.ubuntu.com
sure
kinda true to be honest
the problem is just getting the package manager to do it
set standards-version : to 3.9.6
yes , did n't try that yet , i just downloaded the deb
foo : = multienvcollections ; foo.remove ( cleaupsc )
why will `` other entities life cycle '' watchers cause all dead ips to be fetched ?

this is on a remote ssh connection
in that it 's not actually changing the password/phrase . yes
interesting .
what ! ! ! someone is n't opposed ! ; )
missing pyyaml i presume ?
yep
yep , they are all ready for release .
access it
if you did n't get the .deb file , ditch what you got , and get the .deb file .
if you want ?
just plugin a monitor at your vga and press the monitor button ( f5 )
ok , gon na run in terminal .
grub shouldnt be interfering with updates at all , unless you are using third party package sources .
it 'll look a bit better when i redesign the site . it was just a higher priority to get
it ; s to much info
deleting is deleting . but you kept using that file when you removed it .

that 's blocked on a dbus call
telnet localhost without a port will try port 23 , which is the telnet server , something that went out

just a little ...
using my defaults !
and that 's why it 's commented out . it 's too verbose
others can help too with that info .
so delete everything except the -75 ?
ok , at some point the time jumped forward a day to 29th november then
what ?
that 's how you can get wine on all the systems as you will be able to satisfy deps
could you clarify the mismatching quotes ? double quote at the beginning single quote at the end ?
which other one ?
awesome , i 'll do that for starters
hopefully you will copy/paste that !
i did it in a suite of siduction 's kdenext , which works with the tech i told you yesterday
lspci does indeed list a wireless network adaptor

how do i configure dns to maintain accurate a and aaaa records dynamically ?
yeah , i know .
the machine-0 logs are all perfectly normal
could check with bzoltan
absolutely ! : )
me too
that 's what i 'm trying to do .
but it 's only gles , right , the main package seems ok ?
so , it 's disabled by default ?
xdg_data_dirs
i found the configuration for the system image - but no luck for the store yet
if you install the terminal app you can run `` click list '' in it
definitely not ... it doesnt use any recent rootfs
otherwise the app is looking really good : - ) the only other thing i noticed was that when zooming
are we releasing that to vivid/the store too ?
hahahhaha welcome to posix
there i explained to you in priv
lol
did you try to reinstall php5-fpm ?
we 're currently collecting version numbers of scopes api , shell plugin and unity8 and send them with queries to

fine where ?
lsmod ?
yes , 2500 cummings 6.7
if thats a windows box you 'd expose it to the naighty internet , and you really shouldnt .
if you purge most of the lubuntu specific stuff you should be ok

anything in the logs or same message ?

got it now , this package is built from source code or a ppa one ?
you now have permission to build silos and free ( abort ) silos , but not assigning or publishing .
same bug i fixed previous with the upstart-user-sessions patch which i reverted for this due to conflicts .
since we are not planning to release a gui before seattle , you could script that as well 1 )
that is a good idea
try this : du -d1 -h /
waste of time most likely .
i 'm sorry , but you did n't really answer my question ... .are you trying to view the contents
what file ?
can you explain your issue again ? i do n't see it in the scrollback due to freenode issues
should we make an mp targetting trunk and do a silo with that ? sounds ok ?
yes
startenvworkers ( cmd/jujud/agent/machine.go ) does n't currently have an env
yeah ha , i had different versions in the script to test different parts , and must have muddled them
install sbuild-launchpad-chroot
see wine for running windows stuff on ubuntu
so it may also be a low timeout in the client for tls timeout ?
indeed
what instructions did you follow ?
alright , how do i get pip then ? really new to python stuff .
yes
i tried to install that and it will not install ; /
what kind of requirements do you think we need ?
as i said , there are no rules on where to place folders . it is up to you .
my search-fu failed on finding it , or else on spotting current practice : )
definitely agreed
oh wait , we have some infrastructure code to register
it is a geforce fx 5700
learn it
it should use `` % hostname % ''
elsewhere ?
troubling
probably not , it fails on github.com/juju/xml
on calendar app , can you help or should i ask someone else ?
we do n't , so we should . or just not set it to nil , just set it to

ok ... so last thing is check these linux-headers- < version > -generic packages are there too
you 're the man ; that was exactly the issue
ok , i looked at the diff for all 4 of those packages , they have have packaging changes
thats just nonsense
yup , you need a senior rubber stamp though

sometimes it makes your branch look like it has changed everything in that merge commit .
indeed i do not . because they 're running different oses . we 've been very clear that ubuntu phone

it was not able to finish the last kernel install because /boot is full
lsmod | grep fglrx returns nothing . lsmod | grep radeon shows some lines with radeon in them ( as

you should be able to mount the internal storage in ubuntu
i ca n't : / .. this was a rather urgent trip that i had to take
are you looking at bug # 1357791 ?
hmm
cool ^^
that is n't a live site
or even just the removed packages ?
in which case you ca n't have logical : ) ... . gpt supports , by default , 128 partitions
you can only use one package manager at a time , and should close other things that are doing software
mvo i suspect snappy unpack is failing for some reason
but how come the qt apps work with opengl ?
what version of *buntu ?
your mission should you accept it ... ... ... this code will self destruct on release
update from where ?
in theory , but as i said , the acpi dsdt is detecting linux ... i doubt you 'll find
what you expecting ?
what ?
: -p
i 've no idea what ahci means
i do n't have a good solution , i can check with eric^^ and see if he has any thoughts
with the previous change , i made sure not to update 'moving ' if unneeded when the height of the

so if vivid is booting off systemd now then you 'll see that sort of failure
sending a final message is fine , but the issue is more about one process dying
tell him the ubuntu devs are doing great work .
personally , haskell is an old friend
well you can do it on a phone on 3g so i see no reason why i ca n't :
what i wanted was basically a tiny voice control thing that lets me say `` alarm , 30 minutes ''

how can i do that ?

my freeram is still the same before i fill this 16mb with 4 files of 4.4mb .

yes , it didnt work because the optionwasnt added
but ldap does n't cut it for me . i need a rest api to manage those accounts
no
though technically i 'm not from there ; )
it 's probably consequence of installation using debootstrap
because i have a 27gig partition as primary and unallocated 50 gig that i 'm going to have as ntfs
or use `` apt search < keyword > ''
liblz4-dev is in universe
should there be a link from the old spreadsheet to the new one ?
i remember having freeze on a large hd wd on ubuntu once
see this is why it 's good to have people like akxwi_dave about : ) he should almost hang about
but yes , you dodged it : )
wanted to check with you before filing a bug
well i disagree with you all the time , but that 's just when you 're wrong : )
both
actually my first time on irc so will have to check that later
i was n't following your thread so missed your specific issues/goals
fyi , the rest is excellent .
or some electromagnets
ok , type sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
how 'bout now ?
yeah idk about osx
try to enter the bios to know if it 's an os or pc issue
bug and mark it as feature request
i unistalled by apt-get autoremove -- purge unity and i '' m in gnome now , shall i just reinstall
does that have my mp merged ?
no , but maybe you use uefi and that works ? ; - )
as it 's entirely android thing .
too many low level stuff there i do n't understand .
idk , i still go with 14.04 lts because is there nothing really changed
let 's try , please , if you can see it run more than once , we 'll go for

i created 'change qatracker top 20 page to top 100 '

and where the upstream tarball comes from ?
ubuntu has support over irc , mailing list , and the forums
yes .
not got any optical media ?
ok run `` sudo apt-get purge fglrx* `` < -- take note of the asterisk at the end there ,
no , unlikely
well good luck - i 'm eod
i 'm trying to see how lubuntu runs the screensaver..
we just ran sanity for telephony , waiting for silo 15
does n't matter . ask your ubuntu question .
why do n't you like it ?
i guess , first vivid and then trusty
hahaha
this may well be the case , we 're also moving our branches over to debian git so for bonus
got distracted right after i started unfortunately

upstream for ubuntu . for vivid and later , we use launchpad builders

adb push terminal.click /tmp
slangasek @ ubuntu.com perhaps ?
but if it builds cleanly on a straight backport , meh .
seeing as it 's the first release , i was trying to avoid having all the same information in two
to reboot ?
device list of what ?
noci ?
no , it was just an example . davmor2 has explained that sudo needs to run bash rather than echo
depends on the value and the rest of the setup .
you can in settings-details stop some things , have more control anyway .
you just said they will stop working if declared outside of a page
iasked you before if you used the wifi , you did n't answer so assumed you used ethernet only
master works for me too
just sudo update-ca-certificates ?
< < also works on the music app , so he should know
what should be my next step in figuring it out ?
for whatever reason , the copy of code.google.com/p/go.crypto/ssh it 's building against is wrong
no problem : )
no it failed to go on the first time
yes , the assert is for the carret not being visible , but it is , as th einput has

it 's happening , but britney did some `` trading '' and there are remaining things broken .

i only just came in so missed anything you reported earlier ; which ubuntu release is it ?
when screen switch off , i move the mouse and the login screen dont appear .
no issue
you mean a line space ?
( and i used the jpeg output from the dslr , the raw image is even better )
okay i will look into that
it 's not the pkg , it 's the core ... i guess
custom needs the new rootfs to be tested though
well , i imagine someone wanted to get paid ; canonical is a for-profit company
i 'll probably do : addresses= $ ( juju status -- format oneline | awk '/^- myservicename/ { print $
all the better then - drop it : )
just to rub it in that i have a holiday ; )
type in terminal : ruby -v
well , on android phones , the availability of updates depends on the phone . older phones do n't get
no probs
what happens when you click that icon ?
is it the first time there are manual testcases made for the studio packages ?
ah ! in came in via a stable release . i should have noticed that . in that case there
been doing it hard for about a year , very patchy before that
no 15.10 will hopefully see the change
i 'll have to make myself known then , i 've not done any dev . work with ubuntu but
what about it ?
just pushing my i18n functionality into the shared static lib
you 're amazing ! hahah !

they 've got ip addresses ( e.g . i 'm using usb0 in an ethernet-over-usb configuration for debugging )
hmm maybe , i 'm hesitant to demo something like that tho , because then the audience may expect it
come to the pup we 're in the drummond
hmm , this is another story anyway , but do you know something about apt-pinning , the tutorial says apt-pinning
kind of ... they are in maintenance mode only , no new remote scopes anymore , therefore my suggestion to

my main reason for coming here was to tell you guys about the icon issue , and i wanted to
coffee time - almost 5am here : )
otoh i know dirname is not immediately obvious
i hope so : )
why do you not what that , they are important
i can bump it up .
no i read the 600m strace log to find the symptoms , and from there i could find the commit
we have not , and nothing has been presented to us to make us feel differently than we did before
the port settings are identical to other ports running without issue
how big is the drive ?
the solution needs to be that we can identify someone else with upload permissions has signed off on the upload

i 'm looking at devuan
you talking about the maas 1.7 failure ?
probably , but from the mother ; )
yeah configureing the software notify now
how are the perms ?
what is the output of `` sudo os-prober '' ?
does it work as you expect now ?
now we need someone to launch it though
me too : p
davidcalle : ^ do you have some more info like logs and stuff i could share in a mailing list
maybe in the past . pa usually integrates well nowadays
my personal charm . now i discovered that probably the nfs charm in the store is n't working - i
heya , was just trying to figure out how i could help get wifi working
how did it go ?
did you read of the many many links we gave you at all
maybe , i would love you to do an ls -l /initrd.img as well so we can find out what
which is ? does this not seem important to be exact on ?
it 's only you resolv.conf that does n't make sense for me
in lubuntu scrollbars are chosen by the gtk theme in customize look and feel under prefrences
found the dtb patch
sure , what 's up ?
have n't updated since friday , let me give it a try
well i 've seen it before lol
yeah , already reading that ; - )
is the universe repo enabled ?
i really think we should just transition
yeah , so i guess where he added it is fine
no more wildcards needed , it has changed
thats all in the firmware , i have not seen this for some time so trying to remember
could we have tuned the timout value ?
thx
that 's not going to change anything . this is n't windows .
it 's obviously reading the bootloader and that is reading the os and initrd ( using bios/firmware usb functions )

something else , can somebody other than pitti manage autopkg tests ?
no go , goodluck .
so clearly its mounted as ro ... right ? do you know why its mounting all my drives as ro
ahh , which spec ?
in comparison , a hdd has 100mb/s
fwereade , i was just typing exactly that !
darn ... something is wrong with the ppa
type sudo nano /etc/fstab
in the meantime , i wonder how it works with non-free packages , what kind of files are provided to
click build . like it tells you in the readme file
so was there a support issue you needed to ask here
cheers
wily ?
what kind of computer is this ?
how does this work exactly ?
i 'll backport it to rtm
that could result in some unexpected behavior such as waitpid ( 0 , ... ) returning when unexecpted processes exit
as long as the billing and shipping address are the same , it should n't be a problem
right ... and that is probably because of an acpi bug in the pc firmware , becoming a common problem
if you wait a bit you will get filtering by types btw
i use rsnapshot and let someone else worry about the details , hehe : )
yeah , i know about the concept , but i 've never tried it . i 'll give it a

glad you noticed that
i see no mention of sam hewitt in there , who you highlighted above , for instance .

hey there
boot , chroot your install , then install grub to the hdd
right , and some of them will be discussed in the cc/kc meeting that we are trying to schedule ,
we do n't have a virtual or generic yet .
is true
just landed some more code to support that in a more flexible way , so you can specify how the

we can do type morphing with either

how do i edit ?
ok , we 're there
i tried to deploy the openstack-base one , but it will always try to acquire 17 machines . do you
that requires , re-approve : )
so want me to uncheck these two ?
sounds like a plan .
is it just one deb with all the layouts , or one deb per layout ?
where ?
another thought , you might find it easier if the framework snap 's binaries that you expose in framework-policy are
here 's one : ca n't symlink /run/lock to /var/lock ; please fix manually .
it 's a silly ascii art game
i greatly doubt that , i bet it 's down to mismatched versions
ship it for 1479
i saw the ones about participating in alpha2
lol , welcome to the ubuntu magic experience
that 's the one place that should see all the state changes we record between leader/minion
not regular cc one
you think it 's kernel related ?
nice
yup
it does n't : )
what was he trying to do again ?
ubuntu is installing linux-generic
that 's good , you generally should n't set goroot
okay , i have to check what the possibilities are
i 'll be working on plainbox framework for snappy soon

the 4 is empty ?
guilt is a good motivator .
try to ask your specific issue in the channel mate
but there is only one upstart job for jujud ( or one for each jujud that runs ) ?

ooh indeed . can reproduce . there are more bugs like this . last time we talked about it ,
sure !
no polls please ... do the research yourself
yeah - both of these are problems
has nothing to do with apt-cache , apt-cache just looks up for packages in the archives
heh , no evidence at all , which is why i 'm bugging you : )
i turned it off
and remember for next time , google is your friend ; )
do you have a static ip set , or do you use dhcp ?
looks like some kernel problem maybe but these are older posts
apt-get install linux-lts-vivid
the problem is that the default kvm emulated cpu on i386 either advertises some features it does n't have or
might be the device
k , didnt managed to find that bug report when i searched
could also be someone not focusing the surface
what do you use ?
show us the error and all involved text .
so there might be other packages involved

could you attach unity8.log to that bug please ?
for the most part , no
the pesudo command is `` restore your backup. '' : )
sure
but completly remove the website driver first to not get caughted with mixed driver
asked differently , what is blocking uploading pa 6 then ?
ok , i guess it was announced then somewhere and started to be used
tons of backlog , anything in particular i should note ?
nope , its a laptop
i do mount -v music and it tells me error 13

the whole workflow is very weird : -/
it depends how go get parses it .

great ! should it work with the command we were using ?
can you be more specific ?

install the package from the ubuntu repo .
are there any libs which shold go first=

huh ?
i tried this way before , but was not able to see the usb there then i have tried fdisk..i
did n't say you had to use it
just out of curiosity by the way , are you a developer , or a power user ?
yes , whatever you select at the partitioner/boot-loader stge controls what is written to the installed /target/etc/fstab
you might give overall description including the app .

does it boot or only boots windows ?

let 's try . which iso do you prefer ? the server one , the lubuntu one , the desktop
no .
christownsend , you guys should be using my laptop . everything works there . it 's great !
yes , i did . i still have to check something with bazaar-explorer , since it fails to find golint
perhaps ask # xubuntu ?
does a process linger , then ? on kubuntu 14.04 , for instance , if i have a dolphin window
the best compromise that most suits the needs of the target audience for the phone

no worries , i picked the other pill
a text `` grub loading ... '' shows
upstream also has these vm tests ; the same approach ought to work there , too
so this is not a bug with plasma 5.x then ?
so is this a vm guest also on the bridge , with eth0 connected to an upstream router/gateway ?
yes , but as you can see there must have gone something wrong
i do n't see that your analogy is accurate .
pastebin `` dpkg -l | grep linux- ''
so it does n't turn off consistently or is this a one-off ?
installed which package for xfce
i 'm sitting here very impatiently

you probably also do n't know how to write a v4l driver for the phone 's camera , and that
no

did you start pidgin with sudo ?
our intention is to have a juju provider that uses lxd in 1.26

i disabled some repos but i see the apps iinstalled from them are still there ( thus with their dependancies
well , the enablement stuff should be upgraded in some 3 months to the vivid kernel and mesa stacks
unfortunately it 's at a rest stop . i 'm hoping the gas station will do the same

you still waiting for me ?
i 'm not so sure ; i 'd like to be able to getty in even if the network is
i do n't think there is more than this problem . i looked with wireshark and all dns request that

no , and i would n't accept one if they did.. polish was bad enough
well i had to upgrade to the newest wine1.7 because had trouble with the 1.6 .
using the previous version of barbican ( 2014.2 ) the charm works and you can retrieve and store secrets .

it wo n't ? : (
that 's good .
you can do it in a mo .
few other staffers seem around
unity8 & tsdgeos 's code
they are the same thing
i asked a question that is answered with a yes , a no or a suggestion
anyway good luck with your new server
i 'd say if it is a real world use-case , it 's a feature worth considering .
what says result of : apt-cache policy skype-bin
welcome back . juju is now rewritten in emacs lisp .
yeah , it 's the primary reason i wish we were using trello
without stdlib it 's 200k for pyotherside
why ?
yeah , so ogra_ and tedg tell me that we should be flushing profile data when the application is told

: )
also note that the spreadsheet will be replaced in 1-2 weeks so do n't spend too much time learning how
ok
ok
apt-get download ?
yes double checked : - ) 2tb /dev/sdc says unallocated
and if you install them from proposed , it 's tied up in the eds transition .
on the first intel link on the page , there is another link to the `` new '' download page
kill -9 should do it . if not , something is still triggering it
the one that says `` amazon ''
unity8 will be on 16.10 so it will change alot
this does n't work because grub does n't load
hmm this is the normal weather app and not reboot..does tests pass in trunk locally ?
the packaging is in the ppa / repo , you could grab the binary from upstream nvidia and build a
do the debci trusty images not have build-essential ?
so , `` juju create subnet < cidr > '' does n't *require* a space name does it ?
not pressing if you do n't want 5.4.1 to vivid-rtm . in that case i 'd land it only after
i have a fix , testing now
you really want both things for seo purposes and accessibility , the alt tags in html markup help web crawlers

ok ! !
please read them before speaking again
which is orthogonal to your change but blocks its landing
is that an optimus ?
okay , keep us posted
how is it a bug in the goamz code though ? i thought the proper fix would be for the

you have a dirty mind

lucky for you i do know the answer to that
yes

every time amd comes out with a new card it usually takes 6-9 months for the free drivers to be

i am on ext4 file system . ) )
actually i 'm in the middle of my shift here in rl life
sure , np
ah , i only saw your last line : )
that is n't what we 've been doing
next is to add all these random files to bootassets : - )
if you run into any issues just ask
are you using some ppa ?
no - the version from this morning was the last one . it still has the copy bug
ok , from my pov you can move along with the meeting or finish it
should be doable .
make sure there is n't another running already
no , its not a gpt disk
i wo n't help you . it 's a bad thing [ tm ] to do .
kwin is using kf5 libs
hmm no that will be a problem - the action helper needs to return to set outcomes
it should ... otherwise you can make a script and start it at boot
is there a single code base for both ?
can it do that ?
sorry , i lost the ' ? ' . maybe less
do you have an eta ?
can you explain ?
he made a usb drive with unetbootin which changes the bootloader so the hash is gone . then he dd
amd64 works fine
how do i find the codename of the dist that is on my server ?
just /nick dingus and ask on the channel for help on getting the nick dropped
yep , i tried those , both backlight & os settings . also the `` intel driver fix ''
hm . it may not require a reboot ... but its hard to say for sure . although , if
how many cards did you loose already ? and how often does it happen ?
yeah
its great because you lvcreate and say `` mirror '' and now you have 2 copies across devices for that
suppose it has to do with the firs day of the week stuff
does that get linux-only deps ?
haha that 's the shiniest feature , that page is longer than that tho ( :

is it a cloud instance ?
the same , dist upgrade wants to remove a whole lot of packages without reinstalling/upgrading them
also , this might make _ $ version not necessary
true , shell could do the tracking in the near term
the file clicent was removed from the seed ... we 'd have to put it back
yeah , that 'd be useful as that 's where we have the problem ( requiring uitk 1.3 fix that
no idea - mtecknology ( the guy with administrator status ) has been `` why ? '' ever since the
obriendave has a good point . show us the command you used to get the 'fdisk ' output .
ubuntu is just ubuntu . there is not `` ubuntu-touch '' it 's just ubuntu . there are special image
thing is , all that shit 's only happening with g 's calendar , everything 's fine with owncloud ,
yes
the `` general public '' can figure things out just as you and i had to do .
your question does n't make sense . can you rephrase ?
nothing like that now ( but i am already at around 80 % , should i charge it and try
honestly , just find the person who drew it direct .
do you understand my point of view ? : p
finally running on a supported kernel will give you a better feeling ; )
no , not unless your system has that exact same fault ( what ever that might be - there mounting
/usr/* ?
in most cases its either a package that is not in the repo or its a package with a hight
sure , but if we told the ide that your sysroot is /foo/bar and to compile you run `` in-vm-gcc
how ?
that was the 3.13 package you complained about apt trying to install . it really should be installed .
well then you do a expectfail
that would help debugging the issue for sure , but i have little experience with ralink adapters
=d
yeah ... unlikely the makefile ... wonder about the dkms.conf maybe ...
i tryed to reset phone to defaults , but the loop remained
its the the name of the ppa choosen by the ppa maintainer
ubuntu versions are year.month . so 15.04 or 15.10
yeh i normally ask one of the floorwalkers to confirm it will give a scan
for me it 's complaining about not having a launcher . and also about running out of memory ( ?
towards elixir or haskell ?
and i 've to leave after that , so i 'm afraid it wo n't be today
note that not all lithium ione batteries are made the same though , there are *a lot* of different types
not working , always same problem even when mirror screen is checked
checking ...
`command1 | command2`
there is no difference unfortunately
i could use a command line tool that generates the repolist.json from a set of packages
my nameserver defaults to something like 127.0.1.1 automatically
even though it says it mounted your data at /tmp/ecryptfs.ordmselx there might be some gui dependency since there was that
yeah at the time i uploaded that sru wily was n't yet open ( or named )
downloading will not install it .
can you please tell me more ?
i 'll do some testing in a postgres setting now
thats not `` on itself '' , but yes .
whats documentation ?
that was what you used before too ?
i 've already made my recommendation
probably apache ?
ok , i 'll add a card , good that we found this hack for next week
mmm . i guess that 's everywhere we use it . ( which suggests there may be a more elegant
( and some creds to access that environment )
then whoopsie and network-online.target will fail with `` dependency failure ''
no more testing : d
lol
if you run juju ( e.g . bootstrap ) with -- debug you should see debug messages saying which init
do you have the `` po '' folder in your project ?
otherwise you can just pass environment variables down , but if it requires different build-dependencies and you do n't want
snappy is next-generation click
how check ? like what you have ?
yeah 'cause it 's how the system knows of itself
set up some questions , then mail me them - i 'll pm you here with the address
yeah , i just validated that theory ; )
you can install kci iso from friday and do an upgrade
cat /etc/resolv.conf
so there is an ubuntu mate desktop for arm , talk to the mate people
link to review ?
fine i guess , u ?
same result : (
it 's a valid operation
you could try adding -- agent-version=1.24.6 to your boostrap command , that *might* work
i can not find simular bugreports yet
i do not want extra tools when i am comfortable with a lower layer method
if your caps lock light is flashing , you have a kernel panic . probably faulty hardware or a loose
maybe you can find the new program in the k-menu .
so does qml tests use `` autopilot3 run test_name '' ?
^ do you remember the details ?
licences , you can install openjdk
forums
yeah , i ca n't really imagine that either
is it included with the 'plasma-desktop ' package ?
terminal . did you do any of the steps under user configuration on that page ?
hmm 2 different cards slow down , sounds like more an isp or router issue ?
i 'm doubting it ... but i have seen this fox users on rare occasions
i will literally tweak *every* setting where i have mentioned
obviously , use the correct module-name in place of 'nvidia ' there , to make it match
maybe the # # hardware guys have other tricks to backup data on mirrored drives
yes .
is jose canonical ?
yip ?
so essentially , you have n't actually opened the port on your router ?
( because snappy would be starting them as part of the 'activate ' dance )
type sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
ah ! but how do i `` remove '' jdk 7 ? it 's stil set as default jdk
that one you sent me looks very systemd'y ... does upstart for user services still exist on wily ?
both are good choices
at least it looks likely to be a test-side problem
done .
currently yes .
i know how to install man ... i 'm just being curoius about disabled the secure boot
should n't they run eventually ?
i had a version of the generator with creating ifup-all-auto.target and adding deps there , but that makes the problem
so make your own config mechanism in your app and use ifconfdig up + wpasupplicant + dhclient : )
is there /bin/zsh or /bin/tcsh
drop te -all
the client side guy running the scp or rsync commands on their computer will be using your wan ip (
leave it all to me

for context , please provide your use case for not having sshd get its entire configuration from sshd_config
michi had disabled some tests to get s390x to build in the silo , but we think it is better
go does n't play well with valgrind at all ( dies with rt_sigaction nonesense )
*\o-*
as to what is going on , i wish i could tell you , but i have no idea
cmds get deleted ?
so
upstart is like /etc/init.d ?
sudo apt-get -- reinstall install libpciaccess0
hrm..
because they are a huge difference of version doesitmake any differences ?
screen suspends
there is not really a meeting set up yet , i will simply talk with him on irc and i
test-services needs to be added to d/t/control
what do you think of the thinkpad x220 'tablet ' worth it to play with ubuntu or ...
that should kinda not work
do you have an existing patch that could be applied to nm ? or is it more complicated than that
yes
yes , maybe .. some people are having problem in that link with this update
ok , ok , problem between keyboard and chair
if i sound paranoid , its the coffee , seriously . i have never felt this wired .
ah right it needs to be fixed in multiple packages . i thought it was just an autopilot thing
against the binary ?
sure , i can have a look
as you are using not only kde as the desktop i 'd definitely just go and install lightdm , then
but anyway , unless it 's in both 5.4 and 5.5 on the same import , does n't really help
right , so all packages come from the archive ... the problem must be with the emulator image itself .
i.e . comment them out from the source file ?
yeah , that 's the last thing i tried
ok
you told that numerous times . it doesnt matter at all .
maybe non-obvious : this means i intend to do away with the whole starthooks/stophooks malarkey in modeabide
xenial == sid version , probably due to autosync , are you referring to the older releases of ubuntu (
start there .
no we protect all the tests from the environment
hmm , maybe make the permission of ~/desktop something like 755 and owned by root.root .
picky here as i have spent too many hours debugging nan-induced behavior before ; )
i do remember some onlyshowin entries in the .desktop files
not yet ... qa is still running tests on the current images and well , there 's risk that we
did you try to run my script , that works just fine without reboot required if i remember correctly
we 'll end up in a world of pain
i did . so that bomb you mentioned , can it survive restarts ?
the final line of output was : 0 upgraded , 0 newly installed , 0 to remove and 0 not
ok , give me a sign if it was caused by any of your changes , since otherwise it might
ok ...
it is an alternative if it might be a connection issue
i 'm might try a few more things still
i have java 8 built in one of my ppas for 14.04 lts
1. download skype deb from their website . 2. sudo dpkg -i skype-file.dev , 3. sudo apt-get -f install
that is horrible : (
trust it where ?
anything interesting in warning ?
i know how to use text , and that 's not the question i asked
bug 1526461 - when i see it 's got an ack from you i will do a task
check . pass on my ire to him about the senselessness of `` no copyright '' then . : )
no . i mean ssh : )
ok
i 've been asked about that , which is new to me if true : - )
running xvfbtestdesktopstage
i do n't think anyone here can edit that , so there 's not much point unless you can contact
when the cursor , or mouse stops , for how long ? does it start back up ? is it
many use nvidia-prime .. will not take long to learn how to use it i am sure .
ps -ef |grep < application-name-or-part of name >
i got that last night .
then you 're pinning the wrong certs i guess
i just saw the errors in the dmesg log is all , easily rectified . usb issues at line 678
as far as i know os-prober is used to detect other installations
reboot ?
you ca n't !
for example , you keep music and movie on an external usb hd
i 'll have it still today
rebooting now
did you do all of that ?
there is no way to watch netflix on the ubuntu phone just now
will have to go check the bios settings , cause ' i can run 32 bit guest systems , just
i dont know what capabilities such an attack can have
certainly not
you 'll get similar performance with lvm striping over mirrors
yeah , you either do that , or uncomment the _ ( ) definition and use _ ( ) calls
you mean port ? 143 like normal
i 've tried the binary 340 and 346 drivers and had the same problem .
yes
so do you feel usefully guided ? : )
dude !
i have to argue that it is not plugin specific as it is part of pluginsbase ; - )
the slowing down part sounds like the system is running out of ram and is swapping to a disk swap
its already up-to-date
depends , one long number _he_ read out was to `` prove '' he had my license id .
jibel : wait a moment , retrying powerpc as the failure seems to be just a test-failure

i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
oh , great
does the sound work ?
now , should we wait for someone to fix this ?
what extension the video have ? .mkv ?
sudo apt-get install wine ?
the idea is , we offer alot of support , but never have a chance to talk to each other
there should be , i 'd startpage it .
oh nice
if there was a saucy image for it , that was probably based on cm . you 'd need the

can you now test with the add hardware on the ui ?
make a flash drive instead .
yeah
ok .
`` will get updated '' doesnt mean `` will stay on the bleeding edge versions ''
\o/ i do n't find anymore any example about how to change icon of enter key in keyboard , do
setuptools/easy_install/python 2
but how would i fix the hash sum mismatches then ?
ohh.. then yea , that was my question about using the debian installer or not
the change is really in the non -gles package
maybe you can take over those ppas .
let me type it out in pastebin quickly
pavucontrol
yeah , and you can even have methods on it ; )
but , didrocks in # ubuntu-devel is working on something called `` ubuntu make '' , which is exactly where
this extension will be hide the titlebar that filefox has ?
no dconf-editor edits stuff , gpointing is a package specially for mouse settings

that would ( might ) only apply when hardware encrypting
# xubuntu-devel
yes , but your confirmation might help speed up the dev 's
is /root/uplink/uplink.sh executable ?
it 's not preconfigured for it , no . you can add efnet .
you could let them vnc into your desktop .
keep in mind that you should only use a ppa that corresponds to the release you are running

it should show something like a recoverymode list
there you are
it may be worth trying to speed up , i 've not looked into where the time is spent
that does n't look like my board but let me look again
maybe : ) it 's mostly for generating the click manifest , so yes
you probably want # ubuntu
alright , good deal
will you be on-site whilst installing , or operating from a remote location ?
sometimes it works for a day without needing reset , sometimes it is quite frequent .
so long as you mount the iso , you should be able to just run it and all the defaults
ah , no idea on that error . my basic thought starting out was to get a terminal and run

you must have altered your sources or added a ppa
what method did you use to delete them ? did you put them in the recycle bin ? are they
it otherisempty ( ) contains some info , no ?
oh , well maybe that 's a spreadsheet issue i guess . but that does n't change the fact that
infinity : i still think text only would be ideal . then we could get server away from d-i ,
18
they decided not to use `` type=container '' afaik
namespace changed
also pastebin efibootmgr -v
sure thing : )
ok will do shortly
no worries .
znc is an ordinary package in the 'universe ' repo , you can install it without compiling it , like
which is quite the opposite of cis compliance .
rgr sounds good . this next release we 'll make sure has them as we 've fixed all the colocation
hello ?
and follow up question is , if you `` lose the race ''
i make an armhs generic image .
64bit ?
before you copy , check on how big the disk reports itself . if that is less than 488396800 sectors
swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster . it
will you have exploding kittens by the time we 're on the rat ?
i had a pr for this branch which i added the magic $ $ merge $ $ cookie - that
ta !
pastebin not on here
oh , that would be convinient
how many times should we tell you the same ?
just running winetricks should give you a gui to pick what you want ... to eliminate any typos
any eta for bluez5 ?
what next ? ?
take it to # ubuntu-offtopic
i mean , it 's an actual package
yes , i putted in , to show you what have i ran
awesome : )
everywhere i 've seen it mentioned its behind a plastic cover with a very small network icon i it
no , i 'm using go 1.3.3
if it still fails , then it 's your routing/networking/driver
which metadata version is the md using ( that affects where the metadata is in the underlying partition )
-shrugs-
check your logs , but ssh probably expects certain permissions for that directory which the symlink wo n't meet
disclaimer - i work in the eco , and i have n't touched every nook and cranny of the openstack
it is not ignored inside the default block
sure , install as many kernels as you like . choose at boot-time
yw !
does it cause an actual problem ? or does it just go `` trying to merge ... nothing to do
it does n't test write though
ok ... ( looking up that syntax )
this is not teh first time this popped up , believe me
yes .
maybe the # awesome or # ubuntu-server guys might know ?
you could try the game .exe with wine also
is that what it was supposed to show ?
# ubuntu-touch for the phone talk , off topic here
ah , ok maybe you need updrade
makes sense
i only ask as of 14.04 , it was not stable enough for the ubuntu repos , but is in
ok tnx
when i travel internationally
a very dirty way would be writing a script that contains /sbin/iptables -l -- line-numbers -n -v , place it
seb128 : are you still interested in testing gtk 3.15.4 from the ppa , or does the ml discussion (
be sure to document your findings in the unity8 hang bug ; )
stumped as i am ? frustrating lol
kadu - current version is pretty old , deprecated
anecdotal evidence of one person is pretty useless : )
that will not change anything .
yeah if it 's in granted state the page will never update
would not be very reccomended
+01
unity does n't come with apply button.. simply changing the options applies them .
getting yourself one i guess ?
but it does n't get stdout from an action , it uses action-get and action-set to send and recieve action
so ... are you ready to be a dm with upload right to the package just by yourself in debian
under project- > desktop- > run tab..there 's a field under `` run '' called `` executable '' ... .do
oh , sorry , i was slow
well , it does n't really matter that much this time .
are you subscribed ? otherwise i 'll point him at the bug myself
i 'm happy with it ; shall i merge ?
what 's the privacy issue ?
when it comes to the partitioning stage you can select custom and partition the unallocated section for ubuntu ( default
i wonder if bq are doing their usual lengthy qa on it
on my computer and all others besides a bios access with a key press , you can have the bootfrom
tombstoning your entire domain is n't cool
have you ever done any debian/ubuntu packaging ?
ouh : )
what gpu do you have ?
can you show me the output of uname -a please
well , it 's not always obviously better , but when the reason a build does n't work is ``
also , what release of ubuntu are you on ?
either way , worst case is they should be able to do the same home= trick upstream : )
could be , yet i dont have notifications for irc i happen to be working that is why i saw
i did n't even read your question before ... : d
alright dusk owns the dir but not dragony
as of midnight last night , if delia goes into labour we can have the birth at home
is there an easy way of getting the centre point of a spinning circle entity easily ? or am i
yes
sorry , do n't work much with charmhelpers . though marcoceppi could probably give a hand : )
so you are making it a liveusb/livecd , not a fully functional ubuntun installation ?
to me it sounds like you try to fix something that is not broken at all
all of them can do that too
sudo lshw -c video
but say that tongue in cheek .
agreed , but it seems % q is n't handled quite the same as % s
ah , so your concern is with `` server '' rather than with the whole name ?
sudo dpkg -- force-all -i /var/cache/apt/archives/kde-config-telepathy-accounts_4 % 3a15.08.2-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb ; sudo apt-get -f install
i would suspect as such , but it 's worth looking into
see how it goes . this sort of crap is why i do n't use compiz / unity . too
apt-get is complaining about smth different - another package manager process is running , close any synaptic/ubuntu package manager ,
last comment i saw from you was from 9.5h ago
oh ? the speadsheet suggested otherwise .
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
hah . tried that for 6 months on my new laptop . could n't get the driver to work and
already tried that but it seems like it still keeps some stuff ?
you wrote it wrong .
yes
how do you know : ) ?
we ca n't know which de you 'd like that easily
sure
your computer , your choice .
i asked about jcifs , but still no answer
ubuntu version and eth card chipset please ?
it 's not in master yet - so i 'll land a fix for 1.25 and make sure the fix
i intended to cc the maintainers group for nginx
correct . i 'll update the bug
yeah , i 'm fairly sure the build itself is complete ( on the buildd ) , it 's that
i concur with you .
oh i already run lubuntu as my only os on my 2003 laptop , which sports a desktop-size pentium 4
it works fine for me too , i just lose the discrete card
in my upgraded 14.04 to remove old kernels i run - > sudo apt-get autoremove < - .
ok , try to log in again
what exactly should i be doing ?
`` sudo apt install nvidia-346 nvidia-prime nvidia-settings ''
so you mean when i do su
that way juju from this week can launch tomorrows vivid .
the domain : ad/foo.ad.example.fi is suspective . is domain equal to workgroup in windows ad\user1 ?
thats some deep stuff
speaking of which ppa : ubuntu-gnome-packaging/staging is now ddeb enabled
are you replaceing an exsisting windows os ?
cool , looks like it
your task ! : p
are the majority of our bugs on livecds not from the installer environment ?
yes im running ubuntu
so i take delaying nm was n't good ?
lovely
the main gotcha i 'm aware of is that udev rules must never try to launch a process into the
huh ?
it has come up with .avi
did you enable usb debugging and enable developer mode in android ?
i know , and if you think you know how to diagnose , that would be great -- but nobody
because it returns nil on violation ?
i ca n't remember if trusty used kscreen.\
but it 's not populated i guess
and the apps are all in dutch ?
that 's interesting . i 'll play around with some algorithms after lunch
ty , we will remerge master
however , the frame around the screen scratches so easily : /
there is a 3.13 , a 3.16 and a 3.19 one . the 3.16 is the 14.10 backports , and
i did
sorry to hear that
try to leave the server and join it again
right
yes
you could use openssl to encrypt it
err , wait . wat ?
also , ! means something in yaml so you have to explicitly cast the string with quotes : -/
k , sent
yes i see them
i do n't see any conflicts .
i will
why do you need them ?
optimus graphics cards are hybrid and can switch from intel/nvidia
oh , bon voyage !
that makes sense , only start thing if kill failed to kill it ( its not started=
exactly , renaming it en bloc is simple
not directly , but i suspect the sdl 's surface may be using a mir surface format with an alpha
ok , running now .
i 'm just saying it would be better than what we have right now anyway
yes
it has servery packages too
it 's alright : )
hi
well , since the logic has changed , the tests might break - e.g . 2 ops per list of
similar to juju-core 's params package
but you could just argue that apt-get autoremove will sort it later , if that package is always installed only
^
terminal or graphical ?
marcustomlinson : unity : : scopes : : scopebase : : child_scopes_ordered ( ) seems to be removed , and
no , but this was an outgoing message
i ca n't find any logs to trace what 's going on , so i 'll just commit and ask
did the compiz config manager start ?
i 'll try with 3g first , as i do n't have the wifi code
< sergiusens > seb128 : personal does n't have cloud-init seeded , right ?
i compile last version
no there was nothing . i just picked gallery app in the chooser and then it immediately returned to soonsnap
there should n't be a choice
that is not forcing it
inn this case , you are using ardour to host
i do n't mean to surpass the teams influence in any way
just find and nothing else ?
i just built a new vm - double checked it was 32bit - same issue
nobody in there , another network ?
but i am confused as to what this account is because of the contradicting message and post
the normal shutdown process unmounts all drives
yeah i know the cdrom trick does it , but for most n00b users its a little hard to find
have fun !
you said its slow . so look what is using your cpu power .
yeah , not the lumberjack stuff ... i thought you had coordinated around rsyslog though ?
and recommends : p
i 've never heard that before . i 'm just concerned because it always used to say 100 % and
yeah what did you use to throw the downloaded iso onto there ...
yes , that makes sense . it would have also worked by installing qemu , which ubuntu then automatically would
and it works in ubuntu ?
i imported libintl.h and then used gettext ( `` string '' ) , while it compiles fine , it does
nope
never viewed uefi in my pc : /
i 'd put linux on anything : p
i am running do-release-upgrade now
np , good luck
see /names
yeah
sorry , i 'm dense ... .how does it know what you want built ? if you have a local
you mean upgrading to a 3.16 kernel ? that would mean limited support in comparison to the lts kernel would
and windows drivers dont help you in the most times , because , well , they are for windows .
likely would n't be , systemd-sysv should be installed for that .
oh cool , learn something new every day
if on the system it has /home/.ecryptfs/ $ user/ directory
little , greyback might be better , but let 's try
for exactly zero good reason .
ubuntu-restricted-extras are mainly codecs , from what i know , if you just want only mate off , just do
no problem
yes it is
no that would n't create it
see the previous answer
what irc client ; does it work in other programs ( web browser )
we had discussed support for launching multiple copies of a proc
does it look like they 're owned by your user ?
who says i 'm not : p
glad
are you asking me ?
does lsof say anything at that point , also if you do the proceedure by hand , does it work
on it - removing mir
i 'm checking in stable
you are using ubuntu-gnome not vanilla ubuntu
let 's rule out a conflict in drivers , what returns - > dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia <
maybe you have some good methods to learn a lot of things ? ; p
so , you 'll just be left with that tiny `` i downloaded release before the dists switch and packages
i did n't find pitti here
`` cd desktop ''
fgimenez : but if you could elaborate your question a little bit more , i might be able to give
well , i did n't see it
that is 0.8.16 not 0.8.17 : (
sure
did you try lts already ?
ah i 'm using everything ubuntu . no windows . one last thing , i 'm seeing that it eats
i was caught by this regression too ; took me 1/2 a day of searching to find the explanation .
no it uses the commit message defined by the mp , not every single commit message of every single commit
so what is it really running ?
daftykins and oerheks suggested me m.2 machines for the future : p
the short forms are embedded in the full ones
it 's faster than a dvd . you goof .
i have no idea what the hell $ { backend_binary_dir } refers
atheros is one of the best wifi chips foir linux , this surprises me
yeah ; - )
right , so it should be in the french language pack
oh , wait
ubuntu-terminal-app + ssh + irssi : )
yes . there 's a trick many sysadmins uses to avoid this . when creating an md device not allocating
dunno , who knows what a mac does
reboots can do magic also
yeah would't hurt for a test
without it , it will try to install the libconnectivity-qt1 : amd64 package
that was easy , tx : )
o/ : - )
how do you know its an issue with the router ?
you just entered the juju sales zone
which i was already doing
do you have python available ?
and you are using trunk ?
awesome , well that sounds like a fun trip
sde is not a valid filesystem , sde1 is .
marco and i are on a mission today to crush papercut charm bugs
it 's odd that it does n't show up right away
ok , well in short : the patch does n't apply on top of git master anymore at all
what were you tab completing
okay , from the top . the netbook is a wm8505 . it 's tiny , and damn near fits
aha ! i have experienced a very fast boot up and cpu is holding 98.5 % idle
sorry
256g ssd , 8g ram , i3 from '09
haha setting up some mythtv recordings
it is a bad install , not worth fixing , that is a msdos install ona uefi setup .
will it keep dual boot with windows ?
ouch
i note that the formattedcharmresource has a bunch of fields not actually used in the tabular format ... do you
be good to get rpadovani to have a look if he can ...
approved
given vivid silos build against the overlay , and that sure looks like an overlay-destined upload .
there is an upstate job for the machine , and for each service running
well freeze
nice .
my `` douche '' filter did n't go completely off the scale when i read through the speakers .
do you know if _net_number_of_desktops gets used for something special in xfce ?
i 'm quite happy with mine just working so i 'm not bothering to root it or flash it
ok , add it to /etc/grub.d/40_custom then sudo update-grub
does the indicator use libqfono ?
additional recovery tools would be things like simply trying to mount the image , or tools like photorec .
to approve a silo , is the spreadsheet still working ?
did n't i mention uploading to trusty ?
sort of , depending on luck
i 'm on a lappy now . recenty acquisition . i7 with 16gb ram . i installed 14.04 on it
im in testing enrimont for the moment , everithing look fine for now
i use ssh , but still
yeah i can not deny it is stupid , just asking pitti ritht now if there is a way
ahhhhh ... i see ... : - ( )
i got some kind of flu ( do n't say manflu ! : -p )
append `` question : `` to your question and ask again . otherwise they wont ' see it
you can run that against the kilo staging ppa
however , if on this server you have polluted it with a desk top and have network-manager managing networking .
ha
yeah..i am still wrapping my mind around the listitemwithactions documentation regarding the performance tips
ah , you kill all of tarmac and not just lp : snappy ? that explains why other projects are
ok , type sudo chmod -x /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober
the problem is n't me needing to get an ipv6 tunnel
okay
`` xvdxx '' indicates its a guest of the xen virtualisation hypervisor
that i can look at ?
will i able to make more partitions out of that extended partition ?
damn . i have n't needed a cd for installing for.. uhh.. many years . : /
in reality , -- target-release is just a hint to the apt policy engine to decide which candidates to prefer
well wonderful , then i can start testing the patches
ok , tell me some more info then . the raid mirror , is it a single partition or the
lol ... and it should have ap test for the `` open page - go back '' for all pages
but mem test is for ram . not cpu
the previous code was checking the accuracy only if it was set on both the old and the new positions
wth is that
oh ! ok so must i ask balloons ?
^ -- both accepted .
its important for your ssd to switch from ide to ahci
this is for the nginx package , and it contains hooks for package class bugs/failures , because those bug reports
type ls -l /sys/firmware/efi
yeah had no trouble with the ping from the server . blueskaj : i 'm a little lost by your
minus your credentials , what does the openstack stanza in your environments.yaml fiile look like ?
go in your terminal and type : whereis byobu
yes indeed . oh i like python very much .
and is it also correct that installer causes the black screen when it starts , or , does that display
it would be nice to have comments on the uniter test primitives . for example , what are the various
that 's an excellent question : |
sudo do-release-upgrade
the problem is that on many systems these two ' ways ' of locking the screen cause problems . for
cyphermox , no , that iso has ubiquity .16 , sorry about that
i guess that is due to the container . the network connection works now . somehow the indicator does not
no
cool , so when are native cursors coming to mir itself ?
ok
i had issues at first but it was because of /etc/idmapd.conf what does yours look like
sponsored
no , we all left years ago
ubuntu version ?
yeah , i started down this hole last night with the intentions of it being faster than starting over haha
i like the solid kde apps , i use k3b on gnome
so what wifi device is it ?
i restarted , but i still do n't have support for wifi , just lan as usual
it should be the ath9k
i just removed the epoch special-handling for frameworks from staging-upload . that 's code that i forgot to remove when
yes just run it locally
drag
you can sue the logviewer icon from dash
consider maybe wrapping the command in a bash script , call `logger` and log to syslog that it 's going
assigning your request , btw . do you have a wily silo for the changes as well ? or did
\o/ indeed . working screen ! fast ! fast fast !
yep , that would work . but i was also wondering if it would be better to shrink the images
you need 4 members iirc
is it enough to make the user comments bold or something ? man you 're picky !
hehe
with unity ?
are you certain you selected the correct drive ?
details ( system info )
yeah , restarting isc-dhcp-server prints another such error in kern.log
see if you 've got a /proc/vz/veinfo file .. that looks like it might be reliable way to tell
i 'm confused
i 'd hose the ext4 first ... since we dunno what happend before , and delete also the swap one
can you ? this is beyond the scope of this channel .
yes , exactly
no kidding ... i have been following your discussion on this while lurking in the background . very strange
no , it wo n't even get that far if it ca n't confirm that the image booted
'ca n't be done in terminal ' i dont understand this ; )
topics i 've listed above
i 'm thinking about adding a symlink_path field , to keep information about which path links to which hw device
yes
he 's running a vivid kernel aparently
buy 1 from china for 1/4 the price
right now we have back to somewhere around july/august 2014
let 's go pm
ah , i guess that would have made the update-notifier one obsolete ( but does n't hurt )
yeah i am filing now
try : sudo add-apt-repository ppa : bitcoin/bitcoin
hence , i 've used gist . : )
cool
that does look alot saner
yes , i have read all of them : )
ok tnx
i wo n't discuss it . i came in late to the discussion . what 's up ?
if you get the same corruption on both drivers then the bug might be elsewhere
in the root cmake file
it asked me whether i wanted to remove fglrx-core and something else
we 'll handle that
quit splash
oh great . # ubuntu cut me off
corrupted graphic lines
ok so the driver module is already loaded , no ideas what 's up if the drives are connected properly
oh no worry ! i just had to investigate `` piratepaste '' before even clicking on it .
oops ; tcpdump is not installed in the .115 . and since even ping 8.8.8.8 not works , it is
ok - will check that out when i 'm back home tomorrow
: )
in this case it 's fine : )
the devs should be able to look at the components and assue me before i buy it .
wich ubuntu version are you trying to install
usb
k
i 'm working to make this a bit more robust ...
why on earth would you bother with encrypting the root ?
yeah sorry . someone was helping me out here earlier , but i guess it 's getting offtopic .
+1
15 min to install it ( probably less ) . remember to partition as i said . /home in a
didrocks : say it !
yep that 's what i am doing . the thing is those libraries reference `` common '' libraries , which
scroll down in pmaxk 's link , read the `` dirty '' reply with lots of info . that 's
i 'll also see if i can write an ap test for the lock alone . so we can make
hey !
boot live again , chroot - try update-grub , dunno
they are , but dualboot.sh is n't really .
tyvm : d
oh well , i know the error now , i can deal with it now that i understand it
ah i see , sounds like a tough customer .
that 's what i was thinking if i fail to run from dir , just add the ppa to the
sorry , reading fail . i saw perenvsingular and read perenv
that is the preferred way . i compile my own but i 'm a bit of a masochist
or did you mean just call it lightweight.lightweight ?
the previous time i did the manual installation i did it manually too with copying the drivers and install that
which kubuntu release ?
what change are you adding , what are you expecting it to do ?
nobody said you have to cross over to fb
yes
i guess wehre i am at now is , is there a way to see if it updated the wireless
i 'll hold off of blogging about it for a bit
who uses containers ?
right i 've just seen there are different view layouts
ack..
why ? which exact error messages did you get ?
oh , maybe not python-theblues . i missed the parenthesized package .
that would work nicely too
they are command line utilities that uget uses
i 've made the change locally , will push it up some time this afternoon after doing a quick smoke
update_output.txt also mentioned slang-gsl ( from slgsl )
wow you 're being paid for this ? sign me up .
you can burn that onto a dvd or make a bootable usb drive
will run apt-get clean & & apt-get autoclean ; apt-get update & & apt-get install mysql-server
yeah , but they are not on that channel , mostly the touch one
run sudo apt-get -f install
heh , i 'm back now ; - )
that does n't sound like it is quite as full of chocolate goodness
there is a flavor for every need
any of them please : )
lcspi ?
check /etc/passwd
nope , hordaland , bergen
i 'm going to have him do a build-dep against ubuntu-sdk
should not be necessary , the leds are controlled via /sys/
kci is ahead , also quality constraints are higher in kci
soon
i x-built a proper package
ah , and the cli expects just a list of subnets
is this desktop or server
unmanaged = updates and security are your responsibility .
i meant in featuretests/ - e.g . cmd_juju_space_test.go
done
that was my initial experience , although somehow chromium has grown small and wo n't enlargen back
multitasking ftw : )
i m using the touchpad and it 's working fine
the way i do it is edit the /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment backports
what if i dont want that ?
is apache and mysql needed at boot ?
i can think of a workaround , but it 's ghetto-ish
any
the slowness seems to fade away after i let the computer relax
instaed of asking questions , follow howto install first
office still standing ?
i know . the hl-4050 used a standardized scripte ( brightscript ) . the 4040 was a one off and
and what game ? those drivers are too old for things like witcher2 etc
exactly . thats exactly my problem . so how do i do that ? how do i choose a device
ok , i 'll dig into the code and get back to you
did yes ty : )
it is not a release upgrade
shoot . kyrofa and i might be able to help .
the type of info you get by typing `` last reboot ''
minimal is package management , kernel , bootloader and some basic tools like vi / nano etc
ok these calls did not exist as separate system calls before 4.3 , it seems sockets can be either exposed
then i have made you aware
i blame cloud
oh , wait , fglrx already does that
well , that uses the 3.16 kernel
i ca n't do it personally , i 've been trying to find a sysadmin
upstart uses /etc/init , not /etc/init.d . it just has handler for old sysv-init scripts in /etc/init.d
always !
i hope that is ok. let me know if there 's anything more i can do .
do you know about plainbox/checkbox ?
that sounds weird , but i 'll try it
absolutily not , and the city is imho quite boring ( have been there twice )
press ctrl+o to save , then ctrl+x
you can customize the terminal if you want
i may have put in a check to stop that from happening but i ca n't remember if i just
hiding ? ! ? : p
that only works if you 're awake during the day to open the curtains : -p
what 's your current position ?
i have its little brother here -- the rb1100ahx2
yes
`` derivitives '' is not enough.. its not isolating the kernel as a variable
snappy booted does not erase that iirc , it 's the bootloader ; this way we can rollback if the
do you have any power over askubuntu ?
?
oh yeah , sudo , lol
can you give us a screenshot ?
i should organize a lederhose for ubucon just for you ! : d
the cd image build logs , those are public .
i assume you 're taking care of getting the landing team to redirect their stuff to vivid-overlay + xenial ,
which ubuntu are you on ?
anything new come in if you run `` sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get dist-upgrade '' ?
for now i can really do 'juju ssh ' in a for loop
to hammer home the point , try it with /home/linos/foo/bin/debug/foo.exe
i can guide you on that in a pm
they do seem to be giving more ground recently though .
if you see any ghost silos again , do the prepare , and it 'll say `` request found in
yes , in theory it should be available
the program `` geteltorito '' will show you the boot loader ( s ) in the iso image
was good on xp ?
is it because the flash format ? - > gets damaged every write ?
i have read that people are having issues , either with nvidia driver or bios on msi card itself .
yes , that was a big stepback for qt project indeed . shame , really shame . in other hand

claims to be single stream 'n ' , 135mb ... so assuming you have good signal to this ap ,
so here 's what i know : this critical bug looks a lot like bug 1446871
rvr : both of you should be able to edit now
right ; the fact that it 's qt4 tells me approximately how well-maintained and relevant it is however , so
i 'm using the paravirtualized driver for all the servers called vmxnet3 when i compare ethtool between the istack2,3,4 and
until ubuntu shuts of ?
check your keyboard layout ?
if i 'm down to 2 out of 3 disks in my replica set and another disk is being detached
which one ?
e.g . rsync -avz source/ destination/ vs rsync -avz source destination vs rsync -avz source destination/ vs rsync -avz source/
please stop assuming its my monitor . i have a new 144hz monitor and extensively tested it under windows .
rc-proposed , so vivid overlay

your connection might be slow
ok , looking
is there a way to get back into the desktop interface from the cli i 'll get using that ?
i do
i have ubuntu and i would like to install windows too
we try to solve issues here
i can not see any `` rescue mode '' , where is it ? im on grub now , i
sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
sure.. feel free to leave questions and i 'll respond , or send a long a mail
you could complain to your isp i suppose ...
lol
yes , i mean not supported here .
what do you think , when sturmflut made the new bq phone public ? check the date ... i figured
we all understand the importance of lullaby , i 'll linger for help .
the image linked in the forum post specifically shows `` ecryptfs-status /dev/sda7 reporting `` marker not found in header ''
no problem : d
you might be right for some cases of course , but generally we should ( ! ) avoid 'should '
sorry , i just wanted to make it clear .
i 'll note down to add a table to install/devices ( or shall we call it start/devices ) ?
ok , i 'll let you know in a minute
ask a question if you need specific help
i 'm wondering if for now we should just land a fix for this , then add this dynamic creation
have you tryed all drivers in your list ?
so 4444 is the hostport 4443 is the containerport
yeah , we 're all in ther efrom the standup
i 'd guess the drives get worn out a bit earlier , but hell , you 're using raid ,
well it runs in other virtualisation managers like vbox , vmware etc . so it might be parallels task to
`` it works '' . so what is your issue or errormessages ?
*facepalm*
i would try lts for sure with internet+updates during setup and install nvidia-prime
but i 'll power down and disconnect the other hdds for now and try to install there and mount the

one sec , checking
aha , sorry , then i misread it , you should be in the cc so feel free to correct
use : sudo iptables -a input -p tcp -- dport < port > -j accept
which is the reason all hooks must be idempotent they could be called several times . an operation like building
another os could be a good way to test the usb , you mean ?
yes same nfs client version 4
that 's basically all win32
no .
many linux desktops now have a empty desktop switch basically , usually several specific files , like home ... etc
well you can make it mandatory ( in theory , do n't know if kissiel mentioned if the support for

tying bug edit permissions to bug view permissions is too inflexible .
i see your point and yes it is confusing if you come from debian/control

yeah there were *many*
does wily satisfy all of its dependencies ?
which release of ubuntu is this on ?
is that a real change or just a bug n the url dispatcher ? i saw an issue with it
technically you could write a charm in anything that runs on ubuntu
i use pbuilder-dist ; but ln -s /usr/bin/pbuilder-dist pbuilder-trusty & & ./pbuilder-trusty create & & ./pbuilder-trusty foo.dsc
yeah , downloading any thumbnail from images.google.com should replicate it
when i did , i did n't use the metadata-source flag and everything worked fine , but clearly my config

and sorry i was n't on the same page with you before : (
well how can i get it to work with this wifi ?
well , thats what updates grub.cfg ? or am i misunderstanding the question ?
they do n't , i just hit that one while trying to reproduce the one from yesterday , i guess
ok no difference now , maybe the shadow got tweaked so it 's not at the top anymore
i will push the updates i did to a fork soon , i will try to initialize the rilp in
cause i ca n't see screenshots over irc ; )
that are outdated links
up to you . i can come back after i have eaten
because i literally *just* started looking at this and i do n't have anything on my system at all .
network folders ?
yeah
already running
launch terminal , click `` about '' see gnome terminal , second question , clicked software icon in system settings
it is an opinion , he 's entitled to it , just as rww was entitled to boot his @
whats the default os on your machine ?
i 'm sure more than one , window-mocker for instance
yes . fortunately update is usually good enough you only rarely need a full reflash , and that helps
maybe it just hates me . where are they ?
try with gparted , format , and dd
no
iirc glib itself is done with cloexec
^^
just curious , do you know if jenkins supports ubuntu.components 1.2 yet ? its failing my patch to the filemanager
do you know if output of list-operators is dependant of current possible network connection ?
ok , type sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/boot/efi
there has been some fixes since those debs were built , will kick a new build .
eeek , ok , irssi cut it up
i cant find it , if so , its not possible ?
did you ever reboot after installing ubuntu for the first time ?
ah , that 's probably why then
does it have the target setup properly ?
i 'll move our delivery meeting to tomorrow . lets just do the retrospective today .
one way would be : for i in $ ( seq 20 ) ; do echo > > yourfile.txt ;
haha
there seems to be an issue with lp pulling in the git repo .
i have ethernet connected to 20/1 mbit/s adsl . i have wireless connected to a portable 4g wifi basestation .
this is silly
yes
still annoying though because app-armor wouldnt allow my program to run , due to a exec .
because maas is running locally
i cant get it to fastboot or recovery
right so ... phone is on , mtp connects , and you are sure that developer mode is enabled in
you packaged some xorg snap once ... how did you havdle the keymap generation ?
i have no idea what a .spec file is , so i ca n't tell you .
for ubuntu i mostly run adt-run *.deb *.dsc in my /tmp/build-area/
you can learn more by reading `man apt-get`
i 'm a bit new to it , but yes i believe so ( that 's only way to get
i just thought they were lazy ; )
with backports ?
run the desktop as a regular user . then it works .
you could try to modify the impi template in /etc/maas/power/impi.template
oui
are you worried about data or hardware ?
correct
sure
ah , bummer then . and yeah , though saw didirocks helped a bit . oh ? i was thinking
he is next to me ...
yes i 've just been juggling 3+ people so it took a moment , 15.10 you said you put on
for maas `` shared by default '' and `` no creation '' is clear
i am using xorgs nouveau and i got the kernel via ubuntus repositories
are you comparing lubuntu 14.04 with xubuntu 14.04 ?
reflashed it today as erased it while experimenting with the recovery screen options - did n't change anything .
maybe send your comments to the person asking . dmesg was a valid way of identifying whether the device is
better info from : ' dpkg -l | grep linux- ' and also make sure of what kernel is booting
sometimes you have to connect to the modem to tell it to forward requests
pretty solid
and in terms of the rebase we 're happy to take whatever is on tip this morning ?
will do after sleep : )
adds to the notion it is a lost in translation thing - somewhere .
sorry , trigger happy
just one will probably suffice for this site
try with it off .
the fact that we are still seeing panic means something is wrong . we know that some tests will fail
the wifi page on ubiquity shows an obvious problem , you ca n't easily tell if widgets are enabled or
you can sideload my click ...
understood but given where i am physically that 's going to take a longer and is a little impractical too
ralsina can probably point you at it better than i
a ghost contact appears in messaging app
well , apt-cache policy will show where it 's from , which will answer the question as well
i have changed , and you 're starting the cd . = )
which one ? the plaintext ?
oh are you saying that you do n't have any linux server to use for this ?
hehe
the longer you wait , and the more you do , the less likely it will be that you get
best to ask your specific question in the channel
that 's why i recommended it : d
so what is the best solution ?
several rpg groups are on yahoo ! groups .
the one that took 11 hours .
i 'm asking who i should discuss them with ; )
hold shift while the pc boots to get grub , press e over the ubuntu entry and type nomodeset in
see if it works first ; )
did you check if secureboot + fastboot is disabled in bios ?
give me 30 mins . ok ?
\o/
i 'm curious why you want it to be 4ubuntu1 anyway ?
uptime is like 120odd days or something
eh ? # ?
cat /etc/issue
great
sure
any luck ?
yeah , right now , i survive , but i do n't reconnect to the new one
and i wonder why it 's compiling the schema itself anyway ...
ok , i was thinking of giving that a spin whenever i have some free hacking time
hi !
we 'll have some directive at the bottom of the screen
there are a number of nice features in konvi which i 've found by googling around , looking at docs
i have dual boot system windows/ubuntu . on ubuntu side i made some changes to /etc/default/grub , set the ``
the utopic version of it does n't contain mencoder .
how can i share it ?
you had to learn quite a bit to get that proposed , heh
i care because you 're telling users to do bad things to their systems . so stop it please .
laney : the reason is that britney needs to be able to associate a test result for a particular -proposed
ifconfig to see if you ahve eth0 listed
any idea how it got there ?
probably yes
heh , no worries ! i do n't either , really . : )
can you tell him exactly what to type ?
your choice really , lts for more stable
is that os browser only ? did n't get asked on my phone
i used to play without because i liked the 1.6 sound
failed hosts are n't usually available over the network ...
explain a bit what your trying to do ?
ok i can , with what command ?
so whenever you 're ready , publish o/
both are 4.14.7
exactly that is what it does
ok , slots are 60 minutes , with 15 minute breaks between
i would say run the live media and see how it works
so it 's at least using the address you gave it
in italy the first week day is sunday : )
you do n't get to have both of them in wily at the same time
it does n't say the password is bad ; my guess is that it crashes trying to initialize xorg or
there is no history , just an old workstation i plopped behind my tv to use a media machine .
heck , i did n't check the link
that 's also weird -- after that it shuts down , did you request that manually , or does it
but i am in now way endorsing lp : cupstream2distro-config as a way to solve any current or future problem
just check that you have the correct version of unity8 installed
yes exactly that
if i didnt want it , i would remove it
download it from ubuntu ?
about this bug with the stars : the svg file for them uses blur but in the game it 'll
do you have patch 2.7.3-1 ?
do you had something special in mind to look at or only wanted to find some kind of errors or
simple answer to a question you define .
and then man man
oh : - )
maybe he is drunk or who knows , but please be lenient
i can ; in future just put the whole url in the channel . : )
: )
true . i 'd rather go with pgp myself , or dm-crypt
laptop , trackpad . 14.04 unity fwiw
i mean the reboot id , as explained above ( autopkgtest-reboot id )
working on a fix now
where ?
you 're sure the gateway is usable as a dns ?
so technically you should be fine with sykpe
their website shows you the products they offer
clearfix does nothing on that
gdisk : found invalid gpt and valid mbr ; converting mbr to gpt format in memory ... .and after that
no , i also have the bios_grub partition , requires for gpt
sudo apt-key adv -- keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com -- recv-keys 3e5c1192
same result
i work around by installing openssh-server on the host and sftp the files to it on the host
that 's what i figured ... i 'll look into learning to set things up on the cli and disabling
hmm , you just pointed out a flaw in our planning , we should have invited seb128 to this ubuntuonair
pushed
what is what one about ? this room ? i 'd say ubuntu . haha
yeah , and just confirmed , that 's what 's causing the slowdown
if you can reach robert ancell , please can he avoid updating the gnome mm stack ? before gcc is
if it never ran before yes
: )
oh , i suppose an easier thing would be to just copy the necessary packages from the original silo into
because the version in stable is also already 3.1.0+15.10 ...
sure : )
by the way , i tried `` opengl glx video output ( xcb ) '' in vlc . does n't
nice branch btw
ack .
no , that is either `` true '' or `` false '' ... to disable a specific entry its ``
that 's an album
ok
so purge that package .
big boot and loads of space inside too : )
cool
exactly
because the archive was just too far ahead ( library transitions , breaks : etc
you can indeed have your own local table that maps architectures to paths , but there 's nothing that does
do you wan na watch youtube videos ?
it seems to do that upstream , but that 's totally wrong . it should block until the tab/window it
: let me check if we carry that patch already
did you have a good flight back/w.e ? feeling better ?
i have never actually used a blackberry . my previous employer tried to get me to use one of the
which ubuntu release is that on ?
have you tried wine for any of those ? wine has relatively decent game support
i wo n't update this package anymore ; any other changes will go to 1.23
i am talking about the syncs from debian
you messed you bios ? : ]
ah ok
so then i guess all that 's needed is for someone to run the script to update the package and
look at marsshooter , if you want something new
did n't feel like subscribing > 10 packages ? ; )
that would match 192 and 19222
can you try starting the container again with -o lxc.log -l trace
btw . do n't use root account always
sure
sounds good , robert and i will draft our thoughts
it would obviously be a useful additional to a portfolio for people who contribute
builds and tests on x86 are ok
sounds good
set permissions on your duck duck go cookies to allow them to be read by firefox , but not deleted
sudo service maas-dhcpd status ?
are you sure update-motd always runs ?
i 'd love to see an argument for beauty there but i have yet to find one
whats the problem you are trying to solve actually ?
gon na try again
what 's the test though ?
/usr/share/ofono/scripts/offline-modem [ modem path ]
yeah , tell her to retry it
mmmm , let me see about that ... .
well , i already tested it , would have to rebuild and retest ; p
search in windows for recovery disks
is this inside a vm ?
or searching for an user-data iso which is n't there ?
what do you think about storing it somewhere in /boot ?
okay , it looks like nginx is running somewhere else as well ... hmm ...
thats not an answer to my question .
if the host has a buggy efi
you can , if they are in ubuntu-desktop , ubuntu-gnome , desktop-extra packagesets
yes
yes it 's running now
exactly
hence the words `` local network share ''
is that instruction for me
anything that microsoft has ever made sucks
compare fstab with `` sudo blkid '' which shows the uuids of your disk partitions . are you using encryption
type sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
no
well , i will eventually fix it summer got ta end eventually
oh , right , it comes out rather good : )
by using vgchange command to -a ( ctivate ) the volume group . see vgchange man . and if you

you can use 'cp ' to wipe a disk - 'dd ' is n't any more dangerous . the danger
yes , i 'm not really trying to convince you ; indeed , the advantages would be really minimal
use pkill
? as i said , i would backup , and move the data , and re-partition , and test..
okay ! i use the windows basic tool.. but the fact is that people can , on the youtube tutorials
i ca n't even get contor to build in my local autopkgtext > . <
that makes sense
i though it was working , was it a click update ?
nope
yes , that would be the easy culprit to blame : ) do the nics have any kind of offload
[ 2 ] plug the bootable usb flash drive to a usb2.0 port on the target pc
still waking up : )
they dont run on this machine
then run : unity -- reset-icons
this is definitely a 14.04 system ? `` lsb_release -a '' ?
no worries . : )
via ssh ?
type sudo nano /etc/default/grub
does ucks take care of regenerating hostnames , user profiles , etc ?
check .
ok , so you 've got a file named 'bundle.yaml ' but your bundle is in the older format .
oh that could be a problem
bpfp is a view
i dislike nas devices
upstart ( /etc/init/failsafe.conf )
it says `` not found '' for all mount points
if you want , you do n't even need a boot loader with uefi . you can just let the
that was the best part !
on wily ?
in a live medium . where could i find grub.cfg
using 4 mib of ram for that does n't sound unreasonable these days
are there still open question wrt libreoffice opening different windows ? i missed your ping on friday ...
i ve tried firefox and google chrome
see specs from your vendor . or boot a live 32 bit iso , and check it with ( terminal
ok , mount the ubuntu partition and extract the tar ( use sudo )
hrmm , hard to say really . i live hardware and have done for 20 odd years now
in grub the motherboard firmware 's `` legacy usb '' driver is active but once grub has loaded the kernel
the key is actually the id of the document , now that you mention it , it 's a terrible
no , i 'm implying that the actual *names* of the binary packages are different for wily than for vivid
not yet .
that is in a default install
i lied- its settings - > displays - > stickyedges
sorry for typo error
btw mir 0.11 will be noticeably better for xmir
please do n't say that , it 's going to throw me back in here by morning time
kenvandine , jgdx , yes . when the test is running , that returns true . when the test is
basically grub-install
so it should be a good one
if they agree to include the test like that in their suite then sure it should be in there
lol yes .
you can set backgroud slide to another wallpaper
sure just tell me where : ) ?
have you checked it installs ?
it seems like this is an international frequency issue
later
problem is , the request to get if there are updates works with invalid creds , we wanted to tell
well there 's no composition naturally in lxde . is there something specific you 're looking for ?
type sudo cp /boot/efi/efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi /boot/efi/efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi.backup
when you check for ppas , what are you doing exactly ?
i fixed a bug there not long ago to avoid needless writes if you may recall
are you able to upload plasma 5.2.2 today ? i can see if i can get it past the freeze
do you have an empty usb you could install from ?
well , certain hw implies certain console= settings ... embedded boards like the bb or rpi should efault to serial
idle here a bit longer until devs are awake
64-bit install ?
but i should export qt_qpa_platform=ubuntumirclient , right ? otherwise it seems it 's trying to talk to x
i can get it to show a notification when changing levels in machine-vs-machines , but not on every bullet like
my tests on trunk are passing , so maybe you have n't merged all changes ?
hehe ... yes
also , usually the lp teams are supposed to match the channels .
and your rules file is clearly running them in parallel .
how do i set my full name so that someone can whois it ?
sudo parted -l ?
that 's what i 'm here for , on the source package ?
did you install juju-local ?
any logs ? or something ?
no there is not , but have fun upgrading .
i assumed i have to connect ot from c++ ?
display the package with apt-cache show , wget the .deb and good luck with that
not familiar with hhvm however any remove or purge shows hyou what is going on and a chance to yes
good luck

i believe it was announced that python 3 would be the default for 16.04
sorry to bother you - can you advise acelan
leaving it enabled , if someone puts a bootable os usb in your system , he will be able to
oh where is that ?
yeah , i 'm just doing the `` easy ones '' , some leftover error conditions that are easy to
nice to have an easy one : )
no .
look at my snapcraft.yaml above ... you should be able to mostly copy it and change the values
juno only gets 18 months
i might be able to help regarding where the files are downloaded to since we make use of this in
yep , like any other phone . there is no chip on the market that supports up to date mobile
and check htop maybe , see wich process gets high before freeze
disappointing that there 's no easy way . gentoo uses 'eix ' to see what 's in portage and the
qtmir/qtubuntu supply it if they can , but they do n't currently . qt will calculate it from physical and
type `` nmcli con '' that will report all the networkmanager connections
no , you enabled it globally
instead of /sys/devices/platform/soc/3f200000.gpio , use /sys/devices/platform/soc/3f200000.gpio/**
from unity8.log failed to load module server-mesa-x11.so.4 and qmirserver - mir failed to start
no problem ! yeah , it must have all cascaded somehow from the failed update , sometimes things fail like
did that command and not working then did it with sudo and still not working then went to settings/keyboard/shortcuts and
according to option # 2 , as of 2.8~ it works out of the box ? o.0
sorry i dont mean that way
what command are you running ? i 'll give it a go and see what happens
as you no doubt no , alien is imprecise and imperfect . much better and saner to find the ubuntu
ok , i 'm looking at the network log + ws filter
as in videos about people that try to tell us the earth is n't a spheroid ?
+1 for that .. chrootable sysroots are fine
no problem .
maybe i should tell the newer kernel not to use nvidia driver , somehow
sure
it is , and i ca n't fix it and i 'm afraid if i reboot it will go into
you issue is not about sparse files at all . it was entirely cause by not shutting down your vm

you can resubmit
yes , card is on the backlog . i can start on it now
terribly long return
no bother , i can just as easily check it
basically flash is dead on linux , in the real world
ah , hmm ; i still think generators run too early to be able to decide that
i keep getting errors when trying apt-get -f install
maybe the # # networking guys know a script ?

i 'm like 100 % sure

from the output i 'd say : yes

you can use live stick to install grub using grub-install option .

what 's your question ?
i can take a peek
i prefer lubuntu over xubuntu
or let 's size it after standup
how do i do this do you have a link
i feel like telling a blind man where to go but that blind man doesnt do what i tell him
correct
btw try ls -ld /sys/firmware/efi
did you use gnome.extensions.org ?
done , do you need an mp re-run ?
hmm , interesting .
they do n't share a profile . everything in the hooks database that specifies the apparmor hook gets an apparmor

great
that will be why then

with nothing running ?
soon as i have this test fixed i will try it .
it 's ok to make /e/x/d decide which one is the configured default
also , this is in make tryorientedshell . so maybe it only happens there , which would be odd

yes . it was created with the -m as it was supposed to . i can log in via a
and re-reviewing it is a waste of everyone 's time
it 's an ubuntu dell there is no windows
*nod*
if that means that we can not easily integrate major upstream software than i just see that as a disadvantage
the stable branch is pretty stable
joking ... but i am a mentor of like 15 tasks
is that the one you had in brussels ?
those are non-standard kernel , as you should have read .
hey
yw . sorry about the sad state of that module : / it 's a huge hack in gtk
in that case it was a python2 vs 3 thing .
did you build it on your own time , or on cloudbase 's time ?
but 'nondefault ' is n't a usable template in real-life
lem me know when i can try again pls
or you can try slitaz
charmrepo implements local repository handling too
is it fully updated ?
you do it !
also page titles text uses odl font , make it use oxygen
unless the default settings include en_de : )
also , grab some logs form that
yeah haha i tried installing it as well
yes
consistency
start firefox from a terminal and see what errors it brings up in there
at least it is getting beter
so like eric^^ suggested - use `` sudo cfdisk '' to create a partition - a single ext4 one for
it could be that ssh has transitioned from sysv to systemd .
sure . just use the one in the repos referenced
yes
pm
no , that would n't work ... i 'm documenting some javascript crazy widgets i invented , but there are
sounds good , we 'll get through all of your stuff first
v4.1 : )
because the other does
8mins ?
no problem , i forgot to ask you this morning
so i find myself googling every 10th worth when reading articles . it 's coming together slowly , but definitely
ok dont worry . i was asking because i thought there were a direct solution
then what 's the bitstrength of a default generated ssh key in 14.04
she is well , yeah , couple set of stiches and a cone of shame
does the guest account work ?
ahh cool . yeah . it 's nice .
does the guest account work ?
did you not see her in tango and cash
i 'm currently writing a little conference report about last week , the continue with the process changes with katherine
iranian students get direct admission to top colleges here
; )
i was hoping jenkins would do it overnight , but no luck
yes , it seems lower level . alsamixer reports headphones at 100 % volume , and speaker 0 % .
ah was not aware of that
what are you trying to do exactly ?
dont know if that works with iso booting
yes
yo , how 's the bits you were getting printed going ?
there 's a relatively commong bios bug where the boot-loader and the bios internal functions use the wrong number to
no objection from me if that 's what you described
we 've got a mix of sysv-init , upstart , and systemd : p
yes full lock ups . where can i see the logs ?
yeah , the intention here is n't to create silos . only grouping short-term related work . but it 's
jhb
okey doke
does indeed sound off . ask in # ubuntu-server channel
sound on tv . no sound on pc .
can you see what happens if you do n't have package 'rar ' installed and try to compress something to
well my concern is for non-system-settings apps using that api
i 'm constantly surprised that anything works at all
christopher townsend
: - )
no without i followed the link from the iso tracker to the mini iso
\o/
as you have done all the reinstallation of grub from scratch , and stiill with problems - i would suspect
it depends on bind9-host and it 's not a suggets
hm ? typo ? it
at least the service is good : - ) they rob you quickly , efficiently and with a smile
recording with audacity shows that my mic speed is like three times the normal speed
it would be nice to have your lgtm on it
and this runs how often ? daily ?
unplug from the internet
might have been .
you can find the info in the network manager
hello : )
if you have 6 drives , you can use all 6 together ... part for raid10 for os , rest
let 's see what happens , we can always move to a different silo
can you try `juju destroy-environment -y -- force local` ?
as i understand , we already have the right wallpaper
screen is something that lets you leave the session but it continues , and you can attach to it later
not everything , sorry ; i got sidetracked by some other pings
it 's actually a more nuanced article than that
i did n't know ubuntu had nvidia drivers in their repos ? i thought they did the open source mesa
excess days off : p
sudo schroot -- all-sessions -e
an no shuffle is not enabled
the scenario being `` like when i reformatted my linux partition and could n't boot windows because grub was gone
i know , but it 's affecting many users , so maybe we can somehow solve the mystery
and the default handler is what takes that new configuration and applies policy etc in a safe way
one sec , im trying startup disk creator again ... . last time it was on a sdcard and got
probably , yes
i use max 3 .. i386 vivid , armhf vivid and armhf 14.09
?
either myself or mvo ; i just forgot about it on friday , so today seems reasonable
i have a headache this morning so endlessly scrolling through tabs is about as productive as i can be :
indeed , you 're right
^
we `` create '' an instance of the environ interface , not an actual environment
yes
just wondering if my session died again
hu ?
good luck
what next ? su < name > ?
that was sort of part of the ping/question
can you use lantern please ?
no .
ok , i installed to / so the previously chosen driver was n't detected
does pstree show it running ?
there 's some // todo ( ericsnow ) return an error instead
it you who did it
and that is ?
i just removed the tags . cjwatson 's fix gets me almost all the way there . still two failures
there is also quite a serious bug in gtk2 affecting mate but we have supplied a patch .
o/
well , there 's always gksudo , but yeah
he/she already quit .
wha ?
heh lots of reviewers
watch_only means that it watches only ... i do n't understand how you could think that would build anything .
check /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log
install the awesome package from the ubuntu repo . then you can switch the desktop in the login screen
you can use your disks correctly though
in some cases changing the defaults wo n't help , but yes
but you can try a cancel there and cross your fingers
need ack ?
of what sort ? it 's quite common for the kernel to go weeks without logging anything
ok , but how do we get it into debian : )
nope
in windows can you actually see the ubuntu machine ?
sorry ! check for dnsmasq processes `` ps -efly | grep dnsmasq '' - look at their command-lines to deduce
your keyoboard settings and shortcuts . make sure you 've selected the appropriate layout .
cking and smb were noting some fun /bin/sh /proc/fd fork magic in their traces that i 've only ever seen
you are making this the hardest job ever
not that big a hastle if it 's just the one ; train from airport-piccadilly , piccadilly-stoke
yes , i 'll rebase and then merge your branch
i mean , it 's fair that if all of someone 's contributions can be covered by a package set
we 'll get it fixed enxt week
from grub you can choose recoverymode=== > fix broken packages from there
check /var/log/upstart/mc-proxy -- there might be errors there
i 've just linked them all under that central bug
and `` uname -r '' shows you 're on 3.13.0-57 right now ?
i do n't think spotify is unique to this
not enough information to determine answer
well , from outside the image
then sudo apt get why-not skype
ah-ha , which windows version ?
i have a message from renatu for you ...
i need an explicit command to keep on the network ?
unf9rtunately , it does n't solve 'the issue ' : (
well , this is the first place it 's done afaik . i 'm trying to enable bulk provider api
good . does it have a network connection ?
ah mine looks slightly different cause i have the date and seconds on mine but the hours and minute look
yeah , looks fine and in recovery you shouldnt have disconnects
i 'd be tempted to purge compiz and reinstall
i will do the first round of the code review tomorrow and i will ask zbenjamin to check the code
oh , i see why that happens , because you chaned world writability : )
bug , needs fixing
< 3
ok type insmod part_msdos , then insmod ext2
the command is sudo dpkg-configure -a
er , display density is a configuration , but nothing else needed .
dobey , beuno or chipaca can possibly confirm for you
seriously , it 's almost 2016 ...
is there some way to find out if other stuff is queued ?
can you paste in paste.ubuntu.com the full output of : sudo apt-get update
sure , the question is whether we choose one release for everyone to be based on .
never try to install intel drivers , total waste of time
not that it stops , i just feel like for everything i add i should take one thing away .
yes , that should all be working now
ignore him . looks like you got broken packages . run `` sudo apt-get install -f '' and show us
on # ubuntu-release
depends what the bottleneck is exactly
nm , i am looking at stale data
it returns nothing
yeah i suspect it has something to do with network-manager , although i also see cpu going up when i
yes
the status changes about 6 months ago , and the tags 3 months ago : look at this
the music-app is only adding a single track to the playlist at the moment , because it 's not the
it 's not necessary to specify the version twice
cjwatson : will one of you be around to do the vivid one a bit later ?
my favorite part of ubuntu is that yes , it breaks and has problems , but unlike other os ,
yeah why not , gogogo ?
how should i run it then ?
mhall119 what was broken is still broken , but we should land analytics . last deployment was done with the
that is not ubuquity
my error message is different from storage layout error given in bug # 1499558
the reboot is required because nsswitch is read by a core library early
btw , do you have another bug i could you for sru'ing this ?
great ! feel good after gym this morning
yessum !
thx !
right . basically the same pattern i was following with run-osx-client .
i go to a console window and fix it - sometime you are unable to even get to a console
and this is in the camera , right ?
phone is connected via usb , can list it with usb-devices , but can not see it under home folder
mitigating non-transactionality problems around deploy ?
i always install the edk2 shellx64.efi in the esp as `` /efi/boot/bootx64.efi '' as a fall-back for problems . (
does that actually work ? ( or rather , did ? )
yep , looks like you 've assigned whisker menu to just the super key .
oh , no krillin-09 is fine now , this is a known problem :
i 'm so glad its not just me then !
agree , we should announce . will do that in a bit
you tricked me into acepting a huge review : d
which are all compressed formats , i assume .
using an earlyer kernel does switch off the pc ...
when you have trailing actions , if you pull them 'further ' you get a white background behind that i
was 'tmpfiles.d ' /run/tmpfiles.d ?
sure.. just elaborate about what `` something '' is.. seems like you could be trying to install the 32bit skype
`` /var/cache/lightdm/dmrc/ $ { user } .dmrc '' = > `` session=xxxx ''
i selected only openssh server , and lamp . is it enough to install webserver ?
yes , working on it : )
bcooksley is the man with ideas on how to do that
i 've logged dbus-monitor output for both system and session buses but i do n't see anything obvious .
that 's very odd
when i login to the aws console and then navigate to ec2 i get a `` your service sign-up is
thats what i just said
well that 's possibly a reportable thing in itself : )
are you using networkmanager ?
i really ca n't stress enough that jenkins is just a pile of shoelaces and bubble gum . do n't
freeing up space .
but on ubuntu , the packages get bug-fix and security-fix backports . so the version number is not increased .
or you could reinstall the metapackages
indeed . wondering why it died initially though , cause it looks like the next build worked fine
ok , glad to hear you have it working
the ubuntu-sdk meta package should pull ubuntu-ui-toolkit , but not the ubuntu-ui-toolkit-autopilot i believe
you can install the gnome-desktop package the logout and can login to gnome session from the drop down list but
oh well that one is just more boost_join failures though
let me know your feedback and i 'll request a silo etc..
good - that enables the ceph bits
going back and doing it now
it 's not the entire window , just the welcome screen
ok , so it seems that the state in the backend here is sane , but indeed it looks as
xubuntu 8.04 is a cram as it is
sure , some error handling is still needed , but that 's mostly about permanent errors
right , useless but i have them connected
because in mate the mix of symbolic icons in gtk3 applications and full color icons in elsewhere looks a bit
this test suite has its own timeout , though ; could it be that ?
seriously , if you do n't mind taking a look at some point , that would be excellent
cool , i will try that on arch
grep cron /var/log/syslog
my g+ is going crazy since i got that mx4
the first half of that doc is a lot of pre knowledge , skip down towards the bottom
if that package does n't expect a python script to execute : p
it ca n't be the same version though , you ca n't overwrite old packages in ppa
that 's ok . the above scenario had me confused , but as swap ! = post , it 's
in american english , kolkata is spelled `` calcutta '' . so it may not be recognizing kolkata as a
where you seeing this ?
sorry , should have left a quick comment here
i can understand testing it on dummy files but since the the command moves stuff how can you do a
what ?
coffee on
k ; i keep looking ..
yeah i added net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
type ls -l /sys/firmware/efi
i know , but it 's the sum of things . i 'd recommend to give them the credentials so
ah doublecheck also sudo lshw -c video please
i was n't : p
just halt from a sudo'ed bash prompt
i do not like the h-word matty used in the same sentence as juju : d
it used to be there though ...
i 've been reading about it too . but mostly about not reading the card at all
php should drop some trigget/event that should be picked up by a safely-running background process to do the thing you
?
it 's generated by a trainguard by a button-press , but i did n't do that as i knew the
yes you install it .
but better would be to add it to the beta1 wiki page
done
i just checked , and it still has its config intact , it seems
see how that script does n't mention ethn at all - but sets and uses $ primary_iface
run bundletester with -fvl debug instead
yes . they are streamed and saved on youtube
i agree
yes , more and more.. the icing on the cake would be full kde upload like i mentioned . i
i didnt see a question from you , im sorry ?
what team name was this , btw ? ( in /msg if you want ) this is an interestingly obscure
yes , i can hear the sound of the login screen , but no picture
use dedicated email for support , where each pc/sale gets a unique email address e.g . `` support . <
but the device needs to made writeable
seems like we should certainly have it disabled by 16.04 , so experimenting on 15.10 makes sense
you 're going about that all wrong , you should use bridging in the vm
if you want , safer to just use a chroot for now , there 's a lot of movement in
please stop . i 'm now no longer in any mood to discuss that
yeah but if they are included into ctrl+k you can do quick access without the menu and hud
you might also be able to change some driver settings in xorg.conf
correct
yeah - that command shows nothing unfortunatly
ctrl + alt + t will not open a terminal either , since yesterday 's updates
done
have n't you set up the client ?
poackage is building , , ..
fpaste.org
yeah , but 0 and 1 were started , i just stopped and started 2 . anyway , focusing on
or not issues , but the thing is that we *still* want the text to be in certain places ,
and which kernel version ?
most people leave their channel on default , so those get crowded .
amd64 4.1.0-3-lowlatency
`` screen '' ? you mean the led ?
looking ...
you can download 'plop boot manager ' and burn on a dvd to force the pc to boot your usb
can you help ?
saviq : pmcgowan : the deal is that once you are on 1.3 you must watch out for possible but
this is after grub , after i choose ubuntu
what is nbs ? how to resolve them ?
ok , config looks good , packages is already copied , feel free to build
did you install the guest addons ?
i 've got ubuntu installed about 5weeks . just for testing . i dont think so..
i 'll focus on reviews and getting everything running am
not that i know of
why use a persistent live usb anyways , install as usual to the usb and use a standalone installation ,
are you on ubuntu now ? if so open a terminal and do , sudo os-prober , then do ,
will do . i just noticed the logs saying that it transfered the sound to com.ubuntu.clock/customsounds/ ... *.mp3 etc..but i
the upgrade retried 5 times and has now given up
correct , it 's failing to choose the primary output , but i ca n't possibly see how it could
same : )
unload the cfg80211 module
ok
i validate your existance as a human
awesome
check additional drivers section after your install mate
probably in your graphics card settings ...
yes please
i mean why do you use : )
sorry - del/add
it 's a project that nik90 and i are working on to help app developers for ubuntu .
do you know what wifi chip you have in it ?
any errors ?
mode is set by mount options for ntfs
ok , then normal settings bt tests are all we have
released
me neither
that 's what brought me to your sync bug
i fear for your unit tests ... ...
but feel free to test , lubuntu/xubuntu
... is there a general rule about what will and wo n't get deleted ?
so far my smoothest one was austin last time
how do i run the app.. just to get a feel ?
80,000,000,000 bytes = 74.5058 gb
did you do a screenshot of muon ?
not really ... that api controller tool should be the part of th sdk ide and the platform infrastructure .
you 're up if you want , or we can come back
anything relating to what is problematic.. x logs , gui.. whatever seems to be hung-up..
its much heavier in terms of ram usage
nope that 's new
ok , now i need pointers on how to try out all those branches
sudo apt-get clean & & sudo apt-get update ..and then do the : sudo apt-get -f install
it 's not my problem if somebody starts pulling it in : )
or how long do you think your thinking will take
i 'm going round in circles . been staring at my screen for too long maybe ...
the keylogger one is obviously you misreading about the insider editions : )
that 's it . i 'm leaving .
just doing expense paperwork
no , due to license issues
check your ssh config and if root is allowed to log in
is there an issue with the nvidia card being selected on boot or something ?
let 's chat about the database problems tomorrow - is it something i broke ?
yeah , the mouse pointer disappear in full screen and the computer do n't sleep with the full screen !
you guess ? why not try and `` hack '' your machine and turn it on ?
yes
how are you blacklisting it ?
cool , any idea of time ? guessing it has to be relatively soon for ff coming up .
ok , that 's at least something - i 'll keep digging then
no output at all from lsusb ?
it 'll remove packages that are n't needed anymore
no worries , get some sleep : )
will do
i dont know what is latest on 14.04.xx but let me start with lts as you said
we have to do the same for kvm i guess
well , it 's sort of bottle shaped ...
i am sorry , but i can not help you
even posting a backtrace to upstream will probably help to narrow things down
is that naming correct ?
so where should i write text ? in the end ?
yes
i can +1 but would like someone else to look as well , i am well removed from this code
so what 's the plan ? do we fix this alltogheter ?
right , you did n't actually rename the branch on lp
sorry , im talking about kservice
your sources.list is for lucid which is no longer supported , kubuntu 10.04 , you should be using 12.04lts at
^^
it 'll be in the kernel somewhere , probably fs specific
actually , sounds like you did n't purge whatever card you had before , was it nvidia ?
it should probably be deleted if it 's unused
i 'm designing my client to prevent data harvesting .
yeah , that sounds good
if you can wait til snappy leaves me any time to work on phone bugs : )
in a few years anyway .
also try phablet-shell .
i understand
pushing most current changes to lp : ~josharenson/unity8/slim_greeter_real_lightdm/ and i can send you built debs if you want as well
depence of ram you have
i want you to try posting the crash file to a new ubuntu bug report . `` sudo ubuntu-bug /var/crash/_usr_lib_i386-linux-gnu_hud_hud-service.120.crash
which raid controller do you have ?
no i switched from fedora lxde to lubuntu
so ... have you ever checked how much of the swap space it 's being used whenever you have the
my personal preference would be to export , but i also feel like tastes can legitimately differ , which is
yeah since 14.10 wo n't boot i thought i 'd try reinstalling in place , if that does n't work
but pastebinit.mvo might be older
cheat : -p
i might get a chance to tweak the template a bit further , now i understand how to load libs
is that how it works ? bugs are backported ?
lol . `` not available in your country ''
where ?
if you do `` cat /etc/resolv.conf '' now it should have some # comments and the line : `` nameserver
sorry to interrupt , but your address
not really tested , we targeted overlay for a while now ...
no .
no , other countrys can benefit ubuntu phones aswell
shaking hands and listening to what 's new is !
what do we do with test_suspend in tst_shellwithpin.qml ?
it 's in pkg-gnome , i though you were in that ?
you 're going to have to translate that into dumbese
on that test ?
right . that 's for multi-arch : same packages ; it 's possible to have those installed for more than
i am linking that more for the pictures , then for pastebins . unless you ar eferring to the guidelines
if the add-apt-repository does n't work try this : sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
meh , it 's not really that different anymore . and we do have `` weak ownership '' of some
why do you need it ?
yes - i ca n't find the details right now but there is an enviromant variable which is set
not the partition .
it 's the fact he added the mr like it is something special , do n't tell that we are
you on 14.04 lts ?
it 's also acked by ochosi if you mean you 'd rather have seen a team discussion
`` /usr/bin/apt-add-repository ''
but ns { 1,2,3 } .c.c do n't
i do remember now , yes i wanted to grab the view , swipe it and check . self.week_view.select_single (
still signing ...
yep , already done
i. e. at first sight it seems to take the `` first column '' into account as well for bind
no , maybe that zombie is . can you paste it ?
yeah that makes me wonder now - in theory it is creating an account so why is it complaining -
oh.. that makes sense..
1gb for each guest , is not that fair ?
krytarik , knome . pushed up to revision 382
a virtual disc .
reinstall linux-image-generic , for starters .
yeah taht 's exactly what i do n't get ... to reference the server i just use its ip adress
how do we know we 've already run the appropriate storage-attached hook ?
what leadership stuff ?
using a trusty repo on xenial ?
when you get a moment - i 'm attempting to send relationship data out of a relationship context - i
i worry about that xd
ugh that does n't look good
find the cause
because always when the sessoin crashes , i am either resizing or selecting a new window .
yep , md5 your download and check the disc via its ' menu
that 's what i figured
meh , yum is fine , pretty good and not really any better or worse than apt-get as i remember
yes it is an opensource implementation of cifs .
i 'm sure it is because we do n't have a business layer
get a bigger ssd ; )
i wonder if the unattended upgrades contraption handles that better / differently -- and if you can use it to
run in terminal `` sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ''
nope
you will have to uninstall these two libs before re-installing libreoffice from the ubuntu software center
apps
what else does it show ?
also , that was hours ago , so i assume you 're not around either . : p
that 's one of the problems , they do n't
i have wanted time and/or an excuse to do that forever
havent yet , will do
is that the best image to follow ?
i 'm looking for some others but to be honest i only noticed the first because jibel could n't move
did the jenkins test change ?
i do n't see it on qa 's testing board ... which might mean the bot failed .
you can now use scp/sshfs/samba/ ... between the two machines . `` ifconfig '' will tell you the ip address
hmm , ok try `` sudo apt-get purge nividia* '' then reboot and see if it comes up with a
in the mp , lines 387-394
we should probably have a special inhibit flag for that
arrg ... . bomber stop
just wondering if it 's actually worthwhile departing from the conventional all-or-nothing per result
patches welcome : p
i have not checked i will take a photo now
i can hit superkey and press any nuber immediatly .
yes i did it , but i receive this unable to locate package hhvm-dbg , unable to locate package hhvm
i 'll send an rt to open up smtp , so that we can get cron ( or other )
yea it do that
like sym links there in /etc/rc3.d/ ?
where 's that guy that helped you with your css ? rob , his nick was something with e
i dunno , what engineering manager is in charge of framework api commitments ...
om26er : if there are any stale packages in the ppa just let me know
breaking up easter eggs and swapping bits with other peoples is not the same as scrambled you know that right
which file is the string found in ?
then you did something wrong since the filesystem is read-only .
using the ota tests in the spreadsheet , everything is ok .
post it on pastebin please
yep , its a program
dpm : could it be that static/devportal_static/img/boards/ explicitly needs to be added to static_paths or some other variable ?
ta
sorry , everything 's working well here
eeek
i was trying to remember the other place ; thx
yeah , we really just make use of golang , but we target whatever is in the stable lts for
i guess i should have mentioned that this is a computer that is not only used by me . i
now , there 's a trick to get the current time from xserver , and just use that value without
that 's what i 'm trying to understand : ) i do n't entirely get how this works , but
sorry i lost those logs : -/
in the ci dashboard , your silo21 is for `` vivid primary '' - i did n't think we could
looks like something bad happened somewhere
right
i do not see any /var/www
; ) np
use sudo dd if=iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4m & & sync
when i do so then jujuj-deployer complains about not being able to find condiguration in /tmp/amulet-blahblah ...
the deamon should be restarted if i log out and in again ?
that 's not good
shouldnt need a computer science experience to run an os and get it to work , and have to trash
anon @ ubuntu : ~ $ bash /home/ ... ..start-tor-browser bash : /home/ ... ..start-tor-browser : no such file or
hold on lem me kill the upstart session as i had strace inserted in there to try to capture stuff
yeah , wonder should we warn the user when getting close to consuming home
just to be careful , i just installed your kernel version of t with the one patch reverted and now
my 1st recommendation is to reboot , use the pc 's own boot menu ( usually there 's a key

what other package ?
right , it 's easier to manage 3 people
but it 's worth trying . my impression is that dimitern was trying to use the gui , otherwise also
not official yet ; - )
i figured out where the click package was , the document links to the scope twice
if you manage , ok , if not - no problem
umm , i do n't get it .
however , when we get notassignederror , it 's ok to return [ ] network.portrange { } , [ ]

it would be unusual for them to be taking up much space , though . is a process going crazy
your public key is in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or if it 's not , you can generate one with ssh-keygen
still a good deal , but renting them out would 've created passive income
difficult to say ... probably a race condition of some kind : -/
would explain why i ca n't find it in vivid . : p
but if you do that , a log will say what is wrong
where is the fun in that ; ) nginx + path + status code , ca n't be that hard
maybe a firmware or driver update can fix this , check realteks website for linux drivers
looks like the kernel is now in -updates ( and security )

those are fine..
did you complete the upgrade locally or via ssh ?

yes can do , what needs done ?

so rather puzzled by that
thats specifically for the panel

could you hear me when i was speaking ?
that i know of anyway
i am not fully sure if the sdk ppa includes more recent frameworks , i 'm on 15.04
debootstrap was one of the only ways to do it in the old days
first off , if you disk is full , likely you either have lots of junk or lots of files
why do you want multiple proxy ips
depends on your vps provider
ehci is usb2 support . handoff would infer handing over control to something
yeah , but click review is passing my app locally , but got an error on the store
it 's merged on 1.24 , in the queue for 1.25 and master
now i should restart the pc ?
i am fine with one stick with one ubuntu on it . so i cant tell you what method is
ok whats your drivers version now ?
mazal : that 's an electronic nightmare
you have to free some space . shrink one of your partitions ,
i see now
but if there 's e.g . disk errors or segmentation violations near the end , you might find something useful
i like to provide helpful commit messages if i can remember
so what is the situ now - you can see a pms process active ?
sorry , i mean the same error again
no idea off the top of my head sorry
invite sent
support only , chat in # ubuntu-offtopic : )
that 's the thing , i lost the repos
oh , from ubuntu4 to ubuntu5 ? that 's by far not the latest ( from today , that was
i 'll get it a try then .
still no
and i apologise if it looked that way ...
right but it 's not supported and you should n't do it . it 'll be dead .
yes
where can i find a user list of commands for irc chat ? for example , how would i say
im not from legacy booting
did you try kazam ?
hm , is it merged ?
mystical , some tracks .
ping
what laney said i guess : - )
it 's friendofkiwi , not me
hmm , must be indicator , wellark_ ^^
it would be cool if we could have a situation where we used swift externally but everything else locally
e.g . my only other interface is eth0 and i have two lines that end in eth0
okey : ) at least we have figured out what the problem is . enjoy your upgrade : ) trusty
you should probably log out to the login screen , then hit ctrl+alt+f2 , then do your business
have n't looked yet , just finishung with anastasia , will look real soon
i ca n't do that ; you ca n't use launchpad oauth to prove to a third party server that
you can also check if you have speed problems with an eth0 cable
i am trying to get the pyglow working on the snappy image ... have any of you tried with the
yeah
it 's german , br0
hrm . curious . what would that have affected other than autopkgtest triggers , i wonder ?
but it 's invalid for a unit
i once did a scripted dist-upgrade accross 40 hosts - i have a big trust in dist-upgrade
k , maybe next week then : - )
did n't have the time to hang out on irc much , yes : /
i was thinking _after_ 16.04
ubuntu 6 ?
its more about if you like the looks .
there seems to be a job missing ...
ok , so radeon ... did you check with 'glxinfo ' that direct rendering was in use ?
well i would expect it to only rotate textfiles , for example : )
ok
maybe in arm we do n't copy kernels and initrds around between a/ and b/ ?
ii kubuntu-restricted-addons
it 's nice that you 've learnt a couple of commands , but you ca n't use just those to
no they are there
hi , i 'm a little concerned that the vet warnings can be suppressed . should n't we be fixing
how do you recommend i kill a process that crashes , occasionally , a few times a minute ?
ya . the ones we had that night were in that range as well
maybe try reinstalling
it works without using upstart though
yeah , good job you caught that
but i do remember hitting some piece of check code somewhere that did n't like commas . and that 's
or you can murmur to me ...
excellent work
please read the facts first before you make such harsh ( and insulting ) statements .
you can do that from the live image
try 1 instead of 0
np
ok , but i was n't talking about # ubuntu
we 're talking about gigabytes of data tho ( potentially )
can you go to the grub console ?
lem me try : p
maybe something replaced it ?
get the ova file
if you want them , that would be good
np
sgtm
he 'volunteered '
np .
we did a bit as well , but not as nice as right now
what 's your problem ?
i did the same to you
ubuntu support questions in here , es
its not booting , does n't matter if its ubuntu kubuntu xubuntu lubuntu or whatever
deleted
best thing to do then is run the server somewhere else where you have control of it .
can i see the script ?
ogra_ lsb_release -a says vivid
how much do you walk it ?
i prefer thunar . i hate gnome : p
fwiw i added a gui called clamtk just for convenience
done . i 'm going to grab trunk + barrys branch , merge that all in and move things around
it must be something w/ tagger , ...
what version of windows was installed ?
sorry i mean check if the hdd is listed
have you tried configuring fstab ? basically you do not need that the dev names are always the same ,
have you done it ?
shush , i 'm playing devils advocate .
it is `` sudo snappy service log < service name > ''
it 's only useful if you set a passphrase but in his case you omitted to using -n with ssh-keygen
just the urls that are erroring for you and we 'll chase those in the logs
ok , i know sprints tend to be hectic , no worries . if the list problematic autopkgtests is enough
and shall i just do it by hand ?
it 's perfectly reaonable ( and , imo , correct ) to have both installed .
you are n't a big enough business to need it
im not usre why but for bye they are on the right side ( screen edge ) but not newar
is 20px enough ?
`` it '' ?
there really wont be a `` should '' scneario.. if you dont need compositing , i wouldnt use compton..
i always find dig output too verbose
my bios is in mode `` [ legacy ] or efi ''
but when those new settings are set , something happens that goes `` alright now , lets shutoff and restart
yes , make a packet dump of both approaches and see if there is a difference .
yeah most triggers need revision , but some also get updated like the nvidia-binary page
yes , maybe that 's debian ...
well , dooferlad is actually ocr today
oh yes ! ! ! !
the only difference is that it needs a reboot to perform .
sudo service acpid restart
backing up data before doing any sort of major system change/upgrade is just good practice ,
: ) thanx . i 'm glad to hear you loved the show . took me a while to mix
will give it another go .
to clarify , when i asked about finland , to tip where you could ask too : ) sorry if
done
i do n't think so . tbh i do n't think i ever tried tho : )
which logs specifically ?
it does matter on an ssd
`` sudo do-release-upgrade ''
+1 can you resurrect that logic ?
i knew you were going to ask that . i set that option during the install to get the os
that 's the single patch for david ?
5 % is reserved on every ext filesystem . to give you a booting recovery ( which is root access
pookie in # lesswrong
but we 'll have to see how it works . jenkins always provides surprises
this is pretty specific django question , best to idle in their channel
that makes no sense , try avoiding chrome for a bit , see if it 's to blame
so i thought iptables could help ... but i locked myself out instead
enjoy !
there 's a pack called macbuntu
but it 's still under /boot/uboot/ { a , b }
i assume this is with one.ubuntu.com single-sign-on ?
thumper : not many : stateservinginfoc , constraintsc , settings
before it was literally crash to desktop .
tedg said an < appid > .urldispatcher file must be created in ~/.config/url-dispatcher/urls which would list the protocols the app
ok so you 're in the same boat , hybrid graphics yeah ? i would boot to the recovery option
no such command !
yeah
feel free to bring questions to # ubuntu-kernel
no , 14.10 but with 3.19 kernel
community council or even loco council
can you share the kilo bundle yaml file you used ?
in this case it must be sth else which goes wrong
there 's also inkscape , or the windows program sketchup ( formerly google sketchup ) that works well on wine
we 're not allowed to know the real task , which is half the problem : (
assuming we do n't obtusely drop any of debian 's sysvinit compat , this also gives downstreams like mint a
was pretty calm this cycle for gnome-desktop , may just apply as is if your lucky ; )
ok i see
i do n't wnat to do a full system backup per se
which modules ?
might wan na check syslog/dmesg also for nvidia errors too
instead of /dev/md2 ?
as the bug says , the package provides accesibility and nothing else ?
because you have to ask . it 's nothing personal , but if you are asking these questions you have
ok ... i 've got a 14.04 chroot here so i 'm telling you what i see there .
imagine those 2 hands above your bed ! ! !
firts install an ssh server with 'sudo apt-get install openssh-server '
did you add the nvidia after market or did the laptop come with the 2 graphics chips ... we have
i need v8 version greater than 3.17 to install pecl 's v8js-beta
er i meant sdb1
i see
it depends on what technologies i 'm using , what tables are involved , and a few other variables that
putty to a ubuntu server
dang . if it were mine to solve i 'd use strace on both client and server and hope it
unfortanclely all the peeps i was going to inquire of are presently off-line ... uncle google here i come .
i 'm going to continue pressing the phone team for a fine-grained blacklist so that we can do something better
lol.. totally
yes , of course i will snapshot as and when . but im talking about a way to do dr
third ?
just ask your question i 'm sure someone can help
the joy of using chroots instead of sysroots : )
that command is useless since there is no avconv package
that looks decent to me
dual-boot is fine , using 100 % ubuntu at work and 50 % at home . mostly due to some
so whats your actual command and whats the actual output ? can you please pastebin both and provide the url
i 've emailed supertalent hopefully i 'll get an engineering response .
licenses ? this is ubuntu linux support , it 's free .
so some things do need attention but yeah it 's a balance , and we have a list of done
i understand . unfortunately the oops must be absolutely gigantic as i ca n't get it to load at all
so i 'll stick with leadersettings at this level , and we can look to push that down into apiserver/leadership/settings.go
yeah . a large part of that consists of new unit tests
so , would it be better to have a separate chroot with all the tools i need on the shell
yeah , i just realized i 'm an idiot ; it 's not at all what i 'm looking for
are you in the directory where that file is , when you run the command ?
ive done apt-get autoremove which removed old kernel from bootlist , should that be the cause ?
ah ok. no i only ask just because i wondered if there is a way to backup straight to a
right , so you have a different kernel version there with no supporting modules
of course ! anything you wish to see specifically ? >
what headphones do you have that plug in to an optical audio out ?
oh ... i was wrong home drive is at over 60 . i 'll have to see what is there
this channel is a lol free zone ... .
yes , and that label implies a way of doing something
how can i tell what channel ?
ah , too bad ; i 'll try to land 1-2 to make some room for tomorrow
if you need a new version , i would n't be at all opposed to you helping to merge it
let 's drop the second failing stopsinstances ( ) call from that test then
i missed bq flash today
is the hangout ready ?
yes . it 's the default on lubuntu
i get between 600-800 mails per day , dont try to get into a pissing contest with me : p
we 're talking to mantise
what 're the rest of the specs ? something like lubuntu or xubuntu would be better on there , not
yeah , it 's downloading the 500 mb or whatever
for some reason i associate you with a later timezone : - )
hmm , i ca n't remember . i shall check .
is that expected ?
^^^
i 'd stick to the lts ( 14.04 ) then , that 's my recommendation when it comes to servers
sorry got to leave work now , ill log on my mobile soon one moment
external monitor is `` desktop ''
the current version is r17
when i mute the speaker output in alsamixer
no i followed the guide on the github . i probably should 've used a ppa
it would be much easier if we write the docs in html and then host it ourselves since we have
any reason why apt ca n't figure out to use an outdated version of libjs-jquery-scrollto which is installable ?
another thing he might of done is change the part that was commented out as example
anyway , old argument , best not restarted : )
then you should not need a hosts entry
hehe
correct
nope .
also images needs somelightbox plugin
you put everything into the terminal that i put between double quotes
`` pastebinit /var/log/dmesg ''
you need that nvidia-prime package only
your diff does n't show abi-compliance-checker being used at package build time
yeah it 's a blue screen running tests right now
can we help you ?
so it 's not the fallback
yeah
i 'm going to head to lunch . first step is figure out what we have provided that you 'll
further testing your other suggestion , i can ping the client from the server but when i re-enable the virtual
sorry my ubuntu 14.04 is vps , resource is limited , if i update use ci apt-get dist-upgrade , if
did you disable secureboot and fastboot ?
ok on it
just about to have lunch -- what time is it for you ?
wich ubuntu version again ?
interesting . i ca n't try that right now because i ca n't move it beyond 30 %
i would try running it live just to test if it 's related to ubuntu not detecting it well or
fwiw - ppl have work-in-progress branches in lp all the time , i do n't think that 's an issue
sure will
any idea on how i can identify the error ?
i 'll rebuild them asap , eta this afternoon ( unless it fails again , fingers crossed )
and i -hate- those stupid fixed code box things that force horizon and vertical scrollbars onto everything because the precious
the problem was that the uitk changelog does have date in version number and i did not know that i
these are the three examples of ported libraries to mir : sdl1.2 , sdl2 , glfw3
maybe ; (
you can get back to the desktop wih alt+f7
well that 's the shortest path for sure !
so it 's not possible to install 32bit software in 64bit ubuntu ?
i was just going to suggest you sleep on it
i was able to drag and drop although i do n't put icons on the taskbar
well irssi is in the repos , so i could do that too
do you know how to check the md5 using a mac ?
is that a no ?
for gpg keys ? public and private ?
delete all partitions and reinstall only ubuntu
alrighty
too late
processing triggers for libc-bin ( 2.21-0ubuntu4 ) ...
i 'll be back with the report
just _hard_
right now , reboot and shutdown dialogs are separated in unity 8 unlike unity 7 .
ah sure . but again , if we do n't trust the ! running check , why do we trust
i can google testdisk . you just seemed to have the information in context ...
no , not that one
so i run the command `` ssh-keygen '' on host machine ? ?
ah ok perfect
true . i guess i 'd have to treat reboot as a `` reprovision '' during lockdown
bug # 1473269
yes , however , i need remove the left launcher bar
ubuntu ca n't detect those partitions ?
you mean of articles on developer.u.c or articles on packaging.u.c ?
yes !
you reinstalled 8.1 already ... i do n't really believe you since that 's a bit quick .
so just a few minutes ago , with the runtime package in the repo , i was able to install
part of the problem is that people take things differently than they way you intend
yeah we had iran users before
you could try no_acpi boot
that you need an output rule for for port 80 communication in both directions
why does he want that id number for ?
likely the use of the amazon lens in unity
the tar also needs renamed for the name format packages need
humm , does n't look quite as smooth as it should does it
open-vm tools work for virtualbox too
give more details
except for the purpose of dist-upgrade having to function , we wo n't in any support running xenial on 3.13
cimi ok , np
but yes , i can drag the displays ... but that 's not my problem
nothing eventful . the install went fine , i rebooted ... no hulu . same ol ' error
sure , but we seem unclear again on what that means . : p
i see no real problems with the sources.list file . you do not use sources.list.d directory for the 3rd party
let me double check about the uid , maybe its something local
( that 's a wild-ass-guess )
ok
i would have to do a comparison to see if they 're source-identical
which has never been a problem until we did britney integration , now we really do want the proposed versions
sound card ?
omfg install the kernel !
last i checked .
the server pings the router/gateway fine
so that should clear out any annotation docs associated with the env
do n't we all : p
oh , since you 're here , what 's the word on powerpc cloud images ?
no it 's not
type mount and paste it
any progress ?
then ceck your resolv.conf , dunno where it is located on your os but try /etc/resolv.conf
i 've updated a dependency - specifically gomaasapi
ok been there
done
for keyboard brightness yes , screen brightness no
ah okay so just testing from the liveusb before upgrading
dont set that , it may be trying to pull down updates . just get the os installed . may
i 'll have it site hosted : - )
try enabling a bonjour account in pidgin and get online , that might be enough to trigger it for you
let me see
might be something with that , i use stable only
yes , will do
so it looks like signon-apparmor-extension got added back into the seed even though the silo 19 that fixes the failure
lp ddebs are on for rtm too ?
with the version from the store ?
no , this is xubuntu , maybe you just a bit impatient . this is irc
i 'll rehome the issue when i know for sure
if you dont need jack , then , in my opnion , you dont need ubuntustuduio or an audio specific
and would assume whatever used 80 was shutting off immediately
read backlog btw
this is it
how so ? it simply needs to add . * ' $ { version } ' on line 62
sure , niemeyer 's concept makes sense but if we do the master management for the project in lp they
you miss the -0ubuntu stuff completely
no man . i asked about some stuff back then but i forgot which os i was using . :
the system-image server contains enough information to do updates to phones flashed by 'the factory ' . it does not
so , i 'm running a 4.2 kernel now ( on vivid ) . i noticed that when i put
it 's not my document , so no , sorry .
no , i have to repeat that step every 5 minutes or so to continue using the network
introduce yourself please , and paste a link of your lp & wiki page : )
wb = welcome back
they are . well , i nevertheless updated and first i used persistant mode , but than performance went really
check your sata controller section
known site , bad driver for ubuntu .
there sure are some plans regarding telepathy , but they are not public yet .
is there someone from bq here in irc ? or should i contact customer support ?
will check now
well , with the migration check not working , auto-merge-clean is also broken ; - )
autopilot ?
ask the creators of the sources.. they are not ubuntu sources.. those are alreadyu setup and trusted , and tested/supported
i concur and i have much easier job , since i just blame upstream when something breaks : )
and i do n't think there is an /etc/cloud path in my maas host
what 's the permissions of the file ?
i am not aware of .
what howto are you following ?
ok
you can do that yourself , copy permissions == upload permissions
then you may have logging messges describing what happened to your email .
alsamixer is in the terminal
i dunno what you 've done now , please cancel the build , wait more than 1s , reconfigure ,
though i left that there because of the rebase troubles .
show me the fstab that you currently have on your install then please
anyhow , i 'll nudge you about it closer to release week . i 'm sure we 'd all appreciate
yeah , i 'd better ask my host directly what their plans are
if the performance is better then i am not arguing
i 'm going to fix the test and log an ap bug , unless you have objections ?
you will need uboot.env support in the bootloader
its not visible in the disk utility
feel free to reject if the target bug is not satisfactory , i have another bug avaialble that can be
i 'm going to try and figure out why the uri handler stuff is n't getting called if cutespotify has
yes exactly - cloud
that 's not what the comment says
tested and uploaded .
oh ? netbooks tended to have 1gb ram max , so i 'd consider unity a mistake - totally up
uhm ... yes ...
heh , hence the name : - )
ok
i assume goodtests and badtests are happy-path/bad-path ?
at the risk of recommending blind keystrokes ... what happens if you copy the names of those replacement packages and
yep . you uploaded the fix for me : )
and running without gdb ?
i am not root now what should i do ?
haha yeah for sure - thx .
yes , sorry , i was on my way to lunch and forgot to look at it once i was
me too : )
as you 're going to try with ssh etc ... is it worth me asking the initial tasksell to install
no idea
i 'd suggest filing a bug about your use case not being supported on the phone
window.title has already everything we need
still not seeing any particularly dire bugs reported , though , which is nice . a few that are definitely
ok
well that 's what we did ... . i mean suspend on temporary basis .
go for it
i tend to agree on that
the-not-yet-named-event @ scale : )
# ubuntu is the ubuntu support channel , for all ubuntu-related support questions . please use # ubuntu-offtopic for other
more details on the pc , what is there now is a good start .
i just reconnected after break , are you trying to get optimus working ? '
right , cloud-init is indeed blocking gettys , and it takes effing long
oh to convey it , we can just put it in the issues pane
ok but like ... it 's not on anybody 's radar to qa or publish it , so unless somebody
i.e . in a bit over an hour
i found how to make it manually if you want
right , but it is *supposed* to be showing the greeter - because no user session processes are running .
your branch failed to merge
i ran the program which opens aterminal
what is that 3.20 ?
zbenjamin is actually telling me about the applauncherd experiment : - )
i do n't see any database specified there , also that 's just some part of code , not an
from grub menu try to delete `` quiet splash `` and see what the exact problem
humm , worth looking in to . can you do a screen grab ?
use dd to create a usb .
ok , i 'd suggest rebooting to the bootloader and then trying to flash android again
right , that bug is a request to backport to vivid
click on the ubuntu icon in top of unity
enjoy
good luck !
you could try if the 3.19 lts kernel will solve that
mind pasting your log
better use pastebin picpaste
that 's not the reason i uploaded a new wone
sure as long as they do n't get in the wild on stable
can you check ?
yes
but go to # ubuntu-news first : )
ok. interesting . try with ssh -y instead of -x , just to see
okay , i double check and confirm in a minute
did you alter any directory/file permissions ?
: )
theptr yes , 14.04 to 16.04 is possible in the lts to lts upgrade . but its officially the ``
no no , but i dont get it every boot
add a 1 line changelog , fix up version number and name/email
one of the bugs in 15 can only be tested in the test lab , too .
i would presume so , yes ; but it 's difficult to control that , as we would n't want
do a `` sudo apt-get autoremove '' after that too
ok , i am more talking about finally using debsrc 3.0 for driver and settings
are addressable containers in 1.24 ?
or if you are interested enough , register a domain and create a one-place-for-all site
^ pushing the fix
true
and where do you expect it to change so magically ?
we should have more such groups
as it 's mainview12
can you file a github issue and provide him some info about the format of scope : /// links ?
no ...
zsync is not happy trying to dl core
would you mind add im : $ { lang } : kde-runtime : kde-config-fcitx to pkg_depends ?
without the plz : p
a good challenge then ~
: )
update-maintainer , never had to do that myself
what do n't you get ?
i doubt that 's what you did between now and earlier ; )
that worked the install ?
no you ca n't see it .
only that ?
just looking at the cloudinit code now
desktop at home and desktop at work
all new and shiny here in the 14.04 wonderland ; p
actually , i forgot to mention - -- to does not override series mismatch
how is the security label connected to the apparmor profile ?
ok
yes
bon apetiti
yes , but those are only few swhich are the same
i was not expecting it to do with me
ok.. xubuntu wont be able to supplement the need for proper cables in any way.. expecting it to will just
it does n't
that is a different question

how come ?

but *useless* comments ? i hope not
i 've not hackintosh 'd in years . better to seek guidance in the hackintosh forums
ping go guru
better use plasma5 ; )
after the silo has been assigned , it 's the same process as previously
seems to work fine for me in telepathy . if you click add account , one of the options is
try sudo apt-get -f install , is it all good ?
i have an old usb2 disk caddy and an old thinkpad at work which needs 2 usb inputs ( power
1. torrent the .iso 2. md5sum ( integrity check ) the .iso 3. create boot media
is this an ubuntu live usb ?
by the way , did you see i finally removed muon-installer ?
bug 1504578
oh , you also need -m
so if we can get them verified in the next 1.5 h , it 's all good
mostly because i am using the vm because of work and school work
+1
uh , you do n't have the affected kernel
with systemd-journald being used , `` journalctl -- list-boots '' will list all the saved boot attempts with an index
reboot then try stuff
do you think we should clear some of the media/images we have of kde4 ?
ppas are 3rd party repositories , they are n't supported here and can basically put a file anywhere
very strange that 14.04 doesnt wan na install friendly on your box..
right , and blocks user sessions
thats my issue
the /var/lib/apparmor/clicks/network-managerblah.json
also , do you have a list of packages that would make good targets for snaps ? i know dholbach
it still requires a reconfigure , but in cases like these the lander can reconfigure it by himself - but
then how should i modify my sources.list file ?
lol you can ask that to superman : d
mm . sounds good to me .
language packs should bring in dictionaries
you said what do i mean - did n't see it till now - just interested to learn whatever much
when you say that , where ?
it 's still in the list though ?
for all those build tools , you can poke doko

yes
you likely told it to add that route ; )
possible thumper ?
: - (
yeah , the latest telepathy-qt landing on wily changed the plans a bit , we are trying to accomodate all
ah , now i regret having pinged you as well.. , addign to your sleep deprivation
cleaning up the tags now
or what do we need from here ?
you can download the latest rolling image which came out today , but the official release will be tomorrow .
shoot
oh nevermind
interesting
seems it is fixed ...
i have no idea is all .
good to go ( just make sure changelog looks sane )
ok , looked at the patch and it 's clearly limited to things that are never-markauto-sections ( which seems like
the 4th , which you currently have selected , is the open source driver .
marcoceppi_ made it

watch the language ops keep the channel family friendly
i ca n't remember how i did it . now i 'm thinking it may be wget after a quick
or anything i could try to undo ?
this would be the version reccomended
why ?
will it work if i deploy neutrona-api unit on quantum-gateway node ?
they have removed devices with a parent from the ui and last i saw they had n't got round to

i guess you saw the nomination of me for the loco council ?
there are still regression in translations
no hang on : )
this the unity desktop , or is there an android de
strange , launchpad tests say that mirror is functional , and i can access it too . i wonder if
so this particular one is fixed now , but i 'm sure the next bug will come : )
prior to that there is the bios , then a black screen with a purple boarder .
that one does show unity8 stop/waiting
try checking nautilus for it
ack
how 's hh ?
xorg-edgers ppa line is n't in that file .
tyhicks can take a look with you when he gets here
so i 'll go for chomium
if both try to log in and fail , falling back to the login prompt , then something is broken
yea , that 's all i 've found so far ... afaict it 's not that substantial of a delta
outside of rtm , sound works ; that might be confusing you ?
by a very wide margin
i can prepare mp and silo sunday , travelling to london anway
sure ... but ?
ok , type sudo fixparts /dev/sdb
yes
let us know if it does work ... be good to know for others
yes , you 're very good friend .
okay ... . i hate to kinda run in the middle but have to go take care of something important
ok , you da boss man .
but when you move to the next page , your browser will have already cached most of that , so
o/
a pkill means retcode 0
i suppose you could do that , just make sure whatever non-train upload to wily got synced back to the

there is no way : (
that did nothing
use the 11bg mode
yeah , will pass this information to the maas team . maybe they are interested in adding it too .

are you mixing kernel headers and kernel images ?
i don ' think i can use syncthing as the government office here wont like me using torrent on their

please kick a rebuild of silo 36 when you fix the conflict
ok
hit the changes file for checking the source and binary builds . and no , outdated-autotools-helper-file would be it .
indeed , and with npm libs bundled in your click , you can do very feature-heavy scopes very quickly .
first builds have been posted last night . it 'd be nice to respin with latest langpacks
blake_r : it may stem from the same naive algorithm that code uses
the text property is not resolved when i see the dialog

in most cases i guess customers will use static addresses for nodes
you can run android 4.4.x x86 using virtualbox/vmware under linux mint .
any idea ?

have you tried installing the proprietary drivers ?
or just pastebin it again

talk to your network admin
i mean , apart from coding relation/storage logic into the operations package
i was not the guy who was crying ubuntu-touch is ubuntu ...
we are no longer working a s a stack , we are working as a tree
sounds about right . the instructions i 'm following ( to replace mac80211 module with a patched version ) says
generally not good to install ppas but this does look like your problem probably
i hardly think accepting a package into the archive puts the archive admin on the hook for fixing the remaining

not a clue on it yet , only just installed for fun
ok - that makes sense
good timing : - ) yes the devel channel emaulator image seems to be broken . rtm-14.09-proposed works though .
do n't think so
works here
it might have been freed as part of our clean-up : )
latest okular
though , we manage it in d-i by making hard/useless questions be low priority , so you only see them
cool , can i suggest to tweak the generation to follow go style guide ? e.g . no `` _

what is the output on the following on where you are sshing from : dig mypc.server.com ?
windows thingy - i do n't have any partition to install grub 's stage2
dell xps something
right - but then that means that the majority of items are n't going to be on blueprint - or
ah okay . i 'll make sure i take a look at those : )
just the ones mentioned at the top of the hour .
right , seems xenial is relatively stable , moreso than wily was in early days . probly because plasma 5
nice . i understand that it 's improved performance a bit ?
sure thing , sorry to make life harder there
your setlocale ( ) call is someplace else ?
that 's easy
ah ok , didnt know i could remove the task manager from the default panel
have you upgraded tp plasma 5.3 ?
same issue ?
try installing without the install updates checked
did you add in the unsigned selection hack ?
nothing a holiday wo n't cure . probably .
i can agree with that .
oh yeah , and what about the question about finding updates without a valid token
is it being suggested for removal ? maybe that 's due to a `` conflicts : '' in some other
no .
okies
netbanks , or special apps for your workplace
means a rebuild
? then how did that get run ? it should be a session job .
that package is amd64 ; the host is i386 : )
it works fine
looking at alexisb 's initial attention grab , thinking `` yeah , i need a pint about now ''
for a desktop system its good to have one , its only 3gb . how much drive space do you
i throwing a hint over the fence and hope someone who already knows about qml and foo will pick it
are you running all of update_apidocs.sh or just one specific import ?
the problem with `` software and updates '' was just the last discovered of many problems the system is having
as i was afraid the wily emulator does not show much.. black screen only
i am `` somewhat '' informed ...

perfect ! let me have a look
i know lots of people who will happily update an app , but are reluctant to upgrade the whole system
but has been an excellent learning exercise none-the-less
change your compositing settings
i can open a new tty window , and it works though
i misread t530 then
you 're in the wrong channel
i was writing a byte array ( the json result ) to the response
which one ?
then log out and log back in
or allow layers a helper that could help adjust the python path , but that might be too much
meeting done quickly .
btw , any idea why it was invalid ? did you move the profile dir from another installation ?
how 's plasma doing ?
we need this for sure - we can use it for releaseaddresses as well for example
but it does n't solve my problem .
yes
got it - my server is on 172.16.108.0 and my client is on 172.17.1.0 . the virtual interface docker creates

what is the command on the terminal to check the md5 checksum for ubuntu
oh
clever !
you could try to logout and login again to clear some things
well , we can ask businesses we like
good luck , ping me if you want a second pair of eyes
if you want even more flexibility there are firewire800/usb3/esata available too : )
i do n't think i have tested with multiple ubuntu releases before . fun !
i like the name , let 's go for it ; )
it 's strange as it almost looks as if it did n't see packages in -updates - if i enable
we already have a db for the geometry
yes . running umount gives me 'umount : /dev/sdb : not mounted '
what is your problem ?
no need for that .
you think its better to use that or to install a normal version of ubuntu desktop and then install gnome
do you want me to resubmit or can/will you make the required change ?
and then check that the upgrade step adds them
o/
mdadm ? ? ? oh , maybe a more generic fix
no , it 's not needed
install an operating system with better configuration options , like nixos .
looks like it was a blip on our end
try adding -dcmake_build_type=release to the cmake arguments under projects tab - > build and try `` build and validate ''
np , it 's probably a stubborn bios
i am not brave enough : )
your best option is to boot to a live cd and make the changes there .
he 's trying to dualboot w8/ubuntu 14.04 on uefi

if it is broadcast tv , mythtv would be what you are looking for .
tried
probably so , it does not harm either and might prevent some other lock case .
i ca n't seem to find a dl link for it
will have other patches soon for easy reviews
if i remove the text from the test , it passes ... . !
not entirely , im updating the repo , so i still want the things installed from it
ever heard of pae kernels needing specific attention when upgrading ram ? i went from 8gb to 24gb and that
can you pastebin it ?
got a `` no atom `` message from it
would you suggest i try that first ?
let me think
both actually
that was a reference to cloud ?
as i read it , it seems to suggest some failures . consider your replacement options ... and back up
what is the page code and how do i test for that ?

on the other hand , if there 'd be an option i would have `` restarted '' hard levels ,

rainy here all day
sorry , yes , lets get back on topic
can you make one ?
kay , just doing a quick binnew review here .
well anyway , i 'm just going to write the tests as register has , but it is causing me
what 's new ?
`` yes . ''
i do n't owe you , be polite in here .
i 'm about to close laptop and leave for travel , worst case i 'll demo from the branch and
moving it solved *that* problem
while i enjoy your pun . i do have a tablet on my table ; )
hopefully you 'd know if you had acl 's . what is the output from `` mount '' ... pastebin
: ) tks for re-elaborating it - because i would like to compare the ram consumption of ubuntu vs windows
try moving ~/.config/muondiscoverrc out the way ? ( save a copy for bug reports )
wrong channel for testing and opinions , try # ubuntu-offtopic please
is that when you still see the audio files ?
sounds like a lot of work
nope
well , you can get the .click , gpg -- verify it against the .sig and upload
oh ok , lets start simple then - is openssh-server still installed ?
there is no helper in the deployed packages . hm . this is what strace says while the script is
can you check on your rpi2 if any of the /var/lib/systemd mounts are writeable ? mount |grep /var/lib/systemd
that looks ok to me ; it shows the stop and start .
version of
sorry , check again tomorrow morning :0
it 's on -announce
what package are we talking about ?
yes , he 's been testing it with visits to starbucks ... at least he 'll be full of coffee
*whew* ok , then it 's easy : )
1.2 vs 2.0 is a bit of an internal joke : p its probably going to be 1.2 its pretty
if it 's just for personal use , i 'm not really convinced the amount of work involved in support
`ubuntu-bug packageinquestion`
there is also opinions about leaving half of ssd unpartitioned would be faster nor not , check # # hardware
idk
well , i see another reason for using apt-get directly : the gui is still running and does n't show
i 'm good . just moved to indianapolis , getting setup here , figuring out how much home automation stuff
no , it is n't . it 's fine .
you can use the onlyif parameter in combination with a command , that executes apt-get autoremove and counts the amount
not like that 's specific to bzr : )
nice
let me fetch the sources and dput to the ppa with the version changed
zone= < availability-zone-name >
yes
when you tried dpkg -- configure -a ?
i 'll have a look shortly
try it and see .
but lp : unity8 does require the wily version of unity-api
so we 're patching bluez
i ca n't speak to your specific case . the magnet links have never failed me but i have not
ok
oh i did not know that was possible . so how do i stop that subordinate service from being deployed
yes , i will backport that origins bug , i created the 15.04 task for it , but forgot to
hey
live session is running .
dunno anything about magela
interesting after i install the drivers if i upgrade to 15.10 , will the driver will remain operational ? :
no , how can i make sure ? do i have to come with recovery mode again ?
ah you thought startup disc creator was for creating backups
no problem , english is easy for me , and you are helping the korean users ; )
if you can pastebin the result of trying `` sudo apt-get install nvidia-340 '' ( but abort it , do
sudo ufw disable disables firewall
because we do n't build glmark against the code that 's being landed ?
ok , mount /dev/sda2 /boot
let me search
you need a filtered logging , only keeping stuff you 're interested in and throwing away the rest
make sure you remove the battery .
i would say something like : etherwake -i eth0 00:11:22:33:44:55
so it *seems* like just setting a contact address for the team could end the mass emailings
not totally sure the touch integration is even compiled in that package
sudo lshw -c network still shows your network card driver loaded ?
oh , that rings a bell ... maybe try - > apt-get install kio
yeah me and victor have a split strategy ... me on rtm-proposed him on vivid-proposed : )
hard to tell , try to kill the process ? if you 're not using wireless you do n't need
that 's the leaf node in system image /etc/system-image/channel.ini
but i could reprogram that to other key ( right control )
virtualbox ?
double \o/ \o/
depends , we try not to be too hard , but it *is* a full hour of questioning
ahhh ... ctrl+alt+f1 then `` sudo service lightdm restart '' to restart the display manager
so for what is an ubuntu phone ? just for making phone calls ?
should i be concerned that we 're bumping query limits ?
sru queue ? i wanted it in stable-phone-overlay . there 's my problem so
if it 's still `` dpkg : error processing package grub-pc ( -- purge ) : '' `` subprocess installed
you have 2 monitors ; the built-in lcd and an external vga ?
but the new one is running alright
probably easiest to just add it to snapcraft trunk and we import it from there : - )
do n't confuse matters with multiple conversations all in one
ok , i test it , anyway it will surely happen : p
hi
that usually works , i do n't really understand why the click app you have is using latest
k
then it suggests either the guest is not set to boot from a virtual cd - or the cd is
1.24.3 is there and has systemd support .
haha , i have a big note : )
ah no , ignore me
same problem
why did you make such a change to your security when you clearly dont understand it ... ?
yep ; )
do you think if i just keep mentioning slangasek in every line he 'll reply ?
sudo apt-get purge nvidia-304
that is the case in production but not in staging
depends : $ { shlibs : depends } , $ { misc : depends }
dimitern because i 'm doubting he 's building trunk ?
have you tried upgrading the system ?
i belive so
no . is not hardware . is similar to squashing f 's
if you 're so smart , just tell me the answer , okay ?
the only way to avoid a conffile prompt is to never change the conffile . but you can fudge it
df -h | pastebinit
ah ok
np : )
fat32 is limited for files bigger then 4gig perhaps its that ?
i would maybe look over your hard drive physically
it 's ubuntushape , right ?
the answer is ogra
so if you order that before=network.target , that might help
very bad idea .
this 16d5 repeated twice ... but the productid was different ... once it was f000 and then at the end
you should have played uno the card game , it 's probably more fun : p
i have no memory of that action .
i tried that as well . no other streams show .
what do n't you understand ?
it is n't a framework though , is it ? you just are picking it as type framework because that
they match perfectly
that 's were it got problematic
i wish samsung hadnt taken the removable battery and sd slot out thats my main problem , shit battery life
no biggie . he was here some hours ago .
try one first , i will try with the 3gb ram first
no only the wall and posts
well yeah i forgot the first line saying unity-tweak-tool :
ok , that should be it
well , i 'll keep an eye out for what happens with 83
log a support call to webhostbox and ask them for a guide to setup a new site
forever , please - there 's not even a video connector on these graphics cards .
so flakey test ? i had n't seen this one yet ( i do n't think ... )
so this ( standard ) is ubuntu unity ?
right , i agree . on my older laptop with the same version of ff and ubuntu it works faster
`` linux-image ... '' is only the kernel , but not the headers . for building modules you need the
download hardinfo from the software center and look under input devices
any reason not to land the two remaining ack-ed mps for qtmir ?
has this ever worked ?
with that kind of memory i wonder about numa memory placement but .. even that should n't invoke the oom
and i 'll do some experiments in that code
it is the closest there is to that right now . just get this one , then tomorrow use zsync
aye
cool cool
type sudo apt-get -f install
they were the first ever qmltests i 've written tbh ; )
and lastly `` mv $ { home } /.kde.bak $ { home } /.kde '' ... if the session we
ah , i see you merged my stuff , good
that 's what it return when i run from terminal
no i have not
today
so there is a plan to have devices that still run x , and then run click/snap packages on top
oh wow -- never looked in `` / '' for them ! doh ! thx .
i have a question for you
only if it 's not to much effort though of course : )
show me again what you 're doing please
an hour , yes , two , maybe .
ok , type sudo umount /dev/sdc1 again
what gives you `` lsb_release -d '' and `` uname -a '' ?
the latest version is out and live
beep !
you will have to downgrade xfdesktop4 and xfdesktop4-data
is the volume up on them ?
you do n't need the `` sudo '' unless you 're running as a specific user . by default the
do you see it in a `` snappy search * '' call ?
yes
nope , sorry
and one of my son 's is starting another school year tomorrow
thats not permitted even by default
i can help you with : administrative functions , bot accounts and permissions , debugging me , looking things up
fn + f2 maybe..will give it a try
yes
ping
have you tried using the vmware cli tools to capture the console log of the vm ?
if i login as guest i just get a blank screen with mouse cursor
it seems to but i 'm confused as to why . was bundletester creating an incomplete .venv underneath the charm
is iptables better than ufw ?
i see not problems there either
but yeah if you just have openssh installed on the computers then you should be able to use filezilla to
not yet done , but deeper , heads down in the lifecycle watcher ; ) wondering about its merge (
so you have enabled it in the settings ?
i do n't think it is worth an emergency upload . we can sru the fix
no , i fixed it in ubuntu first : p
my humbel opinion here irt regedit is to sic dpkg on all those old 3.19 kernels and get rid of
and when it says the selected option is activated , check if the nouveau driver is removed from the blacklist
i started learning python less than a year ago and i 'm very happy with it .
you boot the iso / use a supported install method
of course my batter is fully charged to get that error i guess
i created the ones i needed . probably some missing
in fact it *must* , lest bugs like that one
ok so , i 'm pushing a new kernel with owm and so to my ppa
done
the first partition is fat with efi windows
yes , but the icon is blank
checking now the test plan
ok
ok , so under vb plymouthd does n't listen to /dev/tty7 and thus neither prints text nor receives keystrokes nor
hey , ok ... what do you think about wily ?
i prefer the term efficient ; )
just different defaults because it 's using kde friendly stuff
what kinds of frameworks ?
should i just reboot once installed ?
try also from the root terminal , mkdir /boot/efi/system/library/coreservices
oh its a desktop system ?
also rm -rf .cache/qml/apps/*
so , yeah . just a question of having a fairly good idea where to look .
well , you can not add anything now ? this is how you might fix it
have you already tried to boot from an older kernel image , by selecting one from the grub boot menu
yes , they should work though i do n't think anything has changed since the build before
what does `` mount '' list ? and `` df -h '' ? can you pastebin it ?
you 're all over that right ? : )
was getting you mixed up with knightwise
what are you talking about
drown my sorrows with ice cream , eh ? that sounds like a plan
oh , excellent . looks like we 're thinking saturday at 5pm pst/9pm est .
my language of choice is python , but c++ is my second .
ok , i understand ... .wily is the real problem
and can you paste the raw userdata ?
ok ... good to hear it 's liked
ok so the memory looks fine
so lsmod |grep nvidia has a return now ?
marcoceppi_ : and does bundletester respect $ juju_home
-- > maybe we should word it in a way that the important parts are the ones they should start
ok. do you have 15.04 chroot already ?
check /var/log/syslog for cron first
i submitted a blank password ( just \n ) did n't work..
well , thats a matter of luck then
strange , since system and click do use udm
ah , ok
maybe you can ask the xserver guys since that is quite a special question
yeah i 'm not really up to speed with those kinds of decisions ... maybe check with pmcgowan if you
from my reading of the migration docs , it should have had `` v5 '' appended to the end of
data or programs ?
out of curiosity , why are n't new daily trusty ( 14.04.2 ) daily iso 's getting built ? last
which version does the amd file say it is ?
sweet . and then we can add a user that leaves comments too , right ?
they 're not required for fakeapi they 're useful for testing
to go all the way through the system ( both old/new systems )
my advice would be to go for php 7.0 and help me prepare transition path : -p
ok , i 'll be around tomorrow if you need me or just report a lot of bugs ; )
thx .
from terminal
what i have done for power charms was arch=`uname -m`
yep
are you on 14.04 , 14.10 or 15.04 ?
yea you 're right , i was a bit quick to dismiss that . dylan can you hear/feel the fans
great !
if you do an ls -la against where your home directory is mounted on the livecd what do you get
did you run sudo a2enmod php5 yet ?
you asked `` is there more proper way to get the same effect ? '' - those fit the bill
the message does not break anything from what i can tell
yes but they cant handle heavy games like gta5 on ubuntu right
i do n't care right now . bed awaits and i still have some other ( non-work ) jobs to
did you try and install ubuntu or not yet ?
it looks like you 're running both monit and nagios-nrpe , is that correct ?
nothing to do with ubuntu
what are you trying to do ?
continuous integration
i would like juju to treat hosts running docker as a machine on which `` docker '' charms can be
huh ?
yeah
that would be great to have either way , would be better to have the svg for making a shirt

a quite small part
ericsnow : what 's up with the panics , anyway ?
windows is behind with over internet sharing : p
only translation updates though , nothing else ?

is the order of /etc/passwd changing if someone changes his password/

you can also ask your question now , i 'll make sure it gets asked .
do you not have the password for your own wifi ?
it 's a command , not a variable
delete all the partitions in cfdisk
if 'foo ' is just a file-system image , 'file ' will tell you what type

how 's it more stable ?
maintaining my legacy : )
are you sure ? because if we have this backwards , i 'll be back to using the wrong drive
there 's a line in the hook context 's flush that looks dangerous/bad
what else could i try ? or , how can i find out what the right path would be ?
i 'll also test it myself once the debs are built , might not get to it until the morning
sorry for the hassle : )
which camouflaged the issue
yep , got that
a combination of software updater and grub ?
i retried it once more , the previous failures were due to util-linux
there are few good rss indicator out there
remember they need execute permissions on the folder .
any errors when you start from terminal ?
let me see if i understand you . i can get virtualbox for windows , then run ubuntu within it
why do you suspect ip doesnt support multicast ?
i qm here now
so when you upgrade , you will see that issue while daemons are being restarted
k
podemos hablar en interno para que me ayudes ?
revert your changes and test that rules file , ensure it does the job : )
why not ?
lenovo x1 carbon
but how do i get it back if things go wrong ?
the build behaviour tells the slave which of its build managers to use : in this case , snapbuildbehaviour.composebuildrequest
so what 's the plan ?
well , that 's already how multirom manager works .
sure
that exact command will work fine from a livecd .
same stuff is in silo 29 : /
i would like to preserve this , but maybe thats all mood with all-snap anyway because once something is mounted
by remove from custom i mean remove it in overall , we have it in devel anyway
yep , on 1.24 and master
anyway scottk says he ca n't change the upload rights until the weekend so if you need me to debsign
mkdir /boot/efi
you mean that when you select 'document viewer ' from other applications menu , the file does not open ?
this file will only be present on a machine if you start a container on it .
i ca n't find stuff on his computer , if you can tell me what to do i 'll do
i get 200mbps from other sources . : p
does it have a channel ? ( in case nobodys used it )
yep , should be able to get to it very soon
will i have a safe way to upgrade to *something* when support runs out ?
maybe
i do n't want a ci output
did you update and upgrade after the os upgrade ?
i do not have time to write down your issues for you . if you have time to complain about
stop asking for support here , its not supported here at all
sounds like a bad install from the getgo , maybe a quick reinstall would do
mattias what is on the end of 'service ' `` which service & & readlink -e $ ( which service
yeah , worked yesterday when i upgraded
plank is another i 'm aware of .
who put these entries in your host file
you say `` target specific toolchain '' and `` target system 's native one ''
and whoever else wants to spotcheck me : this is the bare minimum that should be in the hooks for

that 's odd
looking at the component-side of the pcb , you can see there 's a flat header socket for the cable
now every reboot is ok
ok : )
it appears they were coming from the cd drive
14.04.. this is a desktop , but i 've experienced it on the server flavors as well
did the conversion work ?
were you doing ntp charming ? i have a charm where the units require clock syncronization . at the moment
yeah , makes total sense . but how do i install the os with nomodeset ?
let me know if you find that any aspect of this does n't work how i 've just described
but is n't termbin just another paste option ?
it 's just some of the group chats i 've disabled them for
14.04 is lts , i would n't recommend changing the init system
14.04.3
what thing ?
kind of sound like a routing issue .
possibly then the miscellaneous compat options , special keys handled in a server ?
i 'm certainly willing to be pragmatic , our track record has just been so bad in this area
cool , thx : )
: how are you mate ? ? i need help connecting to wireless .
wat .
were you able to load the ppa ? that seems to be the first issue . using your link .
yup
glad to do it
i have not seen any way to start a terminal during normal installation ?
it sounds stupid but did you try plugging it out and back in ? thats what i did and it
oh ? strange , for me it was no label without libudev-dev b-d and label with it
i 'd blame the bugblatter beast of trall
stop asking me things directly please , address the channel .
using strace - > get a precise error message - > file the bug report
or from /path/ you can run ./to/executable
i was trying to install unzip .
they did n't make that very easy is my understanding .
yep . there are thousands of people running ubuntu at home . but i dont think visiting them all is
well , you have a small learning curve ahead , but nothing you ca n't handle . are you a
haha that is ok : )
yes
14.04
foxyproxy
so , i 'll let you and rbasak sort out how to get to `` production-ready '' and how long
why ?
a feature we 'll be shipping in ota7 , so for the overlay
hm , yeah , i do n't see it in the priorities spreadsheet , but i remember seeing the bug
gotcha ... .sorry about that ... ..the network id is currently up to date in my environments.yaml ... .that was
pulling source packages
after that make sure to have `` linux-generic '' installed .
and most important : on arm the driver thingy is a total different issue
no need for that
no nothing else
ah yea , so there juju is telling the gui that the hook failed
xubuntu was installed in my old hard drive , since i got new one , i thought i 'll replace
it let met log into my account that i set up during install
ack . i 'll give them a pass then
$ now + 1 ; - )
and i do n't mind them being in separate branches
what 's holding it back from dual ?
press new
yes , you can also use conditions
ack and ack
should be all ok
ericsnow : it makes it harder to understand the type as a whole , and it means you have to
as i said , i try to figure out . and it seems it has nothing to do with the
did you compare the checksums ?
but as you lxde may be a good alternative too
you are supposed to file the bugs just like you do now , and then list their numbers on the

shut up .
i 'm helping students with programming an android app 4 hours a week at the university ( aka sit around
cool ! so , i guess a simple question would be , did you envision the greeter ( desktop/full lightdm
so either run the open source driver , or replace your card
2 more mins ...
the s-i 'removed ' file has 3.19 listed as a remove target
elixir
yeah , but should n't that be in the image already ?
sftp needs system account , i would like to have virtual account
i ran out of disk on one machine . i do n't see how i can add more disk in
you still need something ?
i can , but there are the other tests which do that afair , so it would be a double
ok
dholbach : ah
is there a hd1 , msdos1 there ?
i 'd suggest double checking that , the hub 's event filter looks like it swallows qevent : : applicationdeactivate
grab the file name from the package info in software center
no matter how little work it is
i can only test the actual bits which are proposed for landing . if that 's not the exict build
yeah , but it when i press the ubuntu boot system it says : no bootable device -- insert boot
what part of your pc is overheating
or re-ask once in a while with your link
just ubuntu pcs/server
it wo n't allow me to enable 3d acceleration ...
you have to enable it with the ifdefs in the files
in your use case , it 's less meanigful to do it that way , but it maps logically and
that is a great way of putting that
^ tests > 1hour still a problem ?
okay . it 's a mongodb . i am trying to start mongo compiled version from system run levels .
you ok with me deleting the test as per davechen1y ( above )
it 's not that important anyway , mostly for manual runs on arbitrary targets
try something lighter perhaps , or 14.04
forgot that
it 's a bloody hassle constructing test data with points to ints/strings
because qca
ok can you give url for tutorial ? google is not happy with my work choice i guess
that may be less confusing
no , it should take effect straight away , no ?

say hi to confluency
this is from unity-scope-click , which is unconfined
: p i might have to reinstall
maybe your screen is not what we flag/consider as hidpi ?
it occupies a single node in your environment that you 're managing with juju
pretty much only the _preconfigured_ ui , yes
so , *before* , you were using xubuntu 14.04 ? or 12.04 ? and now you are using xubuntu 15.04
sometimes it does n't appear instantly i noticed
probably popey pushed the wrong buttons and it missed arale
je vais bien , merci ! alors , trop de bugs : )
no
what is it ?
apt-cache policy libmirclient-dev
i 'm in shell mode ctr+alt+f1
so you installed a newer gcc version from that ppa , which breaks other parts of your system .
well , first read all changes to see which could be plausible candidates
but that depends where nginx sends it 's logs
they have the same package base
so that means you also do not know more ... . who could know that ?
but you surely wouldnt mind a record button in the dialer app , would you ( assuming desin team agrees
jgdx : that ubuntu-push fix did n't land in archives . it i guess needs an mp of lp :
prebuilts for releases only ; personal has not been released
afaik there is no ssh server in the overlay ppa
true.. i am on win using putty to connect to my droplet
how are you today ?
well that was one of the reasons we moved the wizard into unity8 . it was depending on things in
they 're part of the same thing actually , so just focus on checking those things tomorrow
it 's just the compiz configuration settings manager , gui for modifying compiz settings , but one of them is
whihc kernel does that have in it
i 'm trying to work out now why it has logged what it logged
ah , blueskaj told me to do-release-upgrade -d
dunno for sure , but you could try dd , it works for most bootable images
i cannaot ask there
where is this shown ?
dpkg -l jack
yeah , listening to good music , merging a bunch of dev branches for the test server .
mup is on xmass holiday already : d ...
i do n't suppose if you know how i can add torrents to labels/create new labels in the webui ?
i wanted to say ubuntu.components 1.3 : d
nada ... nothing will be installed/removed ... . systemctl restart sddm ... problem persists ...
ls -al .xauthority ?
we could guess the button size from the view ratio
that would be a nice choice indeed
[ that feels to me like a broker implementation detail on which we should not be depending ? ]
that sounds good to me
just checking , as maybe remove the hearers too in an instance of removing the images ?
good point above ^ , it may be just be in the repositories , and you could just install them
add , then depends on what you wan na start ...
hm , needs a core dev ack
the new company wide vpn
of course it is
it 's on my list to investigate for today/tomorrow
you around ?
google : p
how do i run it ?
i have done it
line 301 is the a.stop call from the test ( pretty sure )
check /android/firmware
you mean the pc speaker ? ( boot beep ? )
grub sits on the menu when the last booted kernel fails
who would call that ?
ok , issue is that if we start rebuilds for e-d-s/libgtop we might pick more things and gnome-desktop gets harder
if you 're cool with that do you mind approving the mp ? : - )
this was about 10 years ago , so maybe . they did claim that the meter was inside the property
^^^
you may have to reconnect virt-manager . ive installed all the updates , but havent seen the problem . but
yeah even then the largest thing is /usr which has 1.2g used .
problem is the missing gpg verification
and please show the output of `` groups '' in terminal
single or still dualboot ?
oh great
the app_id is composed of the package name , the appname and the version
i 'm not irc savvy , does that mean i 'm in an incorrect room for old releases ?
actually i accidently this channel
do me a favor and drop in that tests.yaml fix suggested above and see if it works for you
did you type 'sudo apt-get update ' ?
oh , nice ! i 'll download it again and give it another try . ( :
first try alsamixer and press f5 , see if mic is detected and capture is showing under it .
yeah , it briefly shows ubiquity but then flashes to the tty and then goes into the live session .
fwiw partitionmanager starts fine for me on 15.04
alternatively , change permission of firefox ( if only 2 users involved ) to only gives execute rights to user
if i build and install the deb , whats the binary name to start the app ?

that 's a personal choice
yup , julien has been re-organsing things , it is still 'off-line ' as the last update i had
yes , tell us , what about ?
how did you used to dual boot them ?
sorry
that is not a generic statement
alright
man system.unit
but maybe we should just give up and export the bzr-ish name
because it 's a resubmit to a different branch
sorrt . coldheater disconnected , and autocomplete wrote your name : /
it has a few other hang bugs too
nice , i was hoping to see a stadium lit by the glow of laptop screens though
and no , we should not promote that to developers
that should n't be relevant to you
sorry i ca n't make it work when running root either , nothing happens
ubuntusoftwarecentre also stuck at 0 %
roger that : d
ooh nice
which version are you trying to put on ?
just a wording quibble

in my closet , 192.168.0.250,192.168.0.251,192.168.0.252 i made a minor modification to interfaces .
did n't you just answer your own question ? though generally they can just get demoted to -proposed
you can specify a lower resolution ( 720p instead of 1080p ) , that 'll make everything larger ( and

setting the same config on two deployed services is not that hard
of course it depends where you 're located and which servers are best for you
when changing the source to the next cloud archive it did not update the apt sources file , hence there
i presume other container technologies might need a separate step for `` install the image '' before running it ...
almost every , but in overall there 's like 20 scoperunner crashes in the smoketesting runs

i could be wrong , but it only seemed to land 5 days ago and when i compared master to
for me the failing point was changing ... but calculator was the most typical
fair enough
to name workspaces , just rebind your keys : - bindsym $ mod+1 workspace $ ws1
you actually can but it will likely break your installation . as you said : partitioning from a mounted ,
right , i do n't care about that use case right now

that may be . do you have any idea which one comes into question ?
pastebin quilt push
run a apt-get update before
i have a sample tex file on there as well
you give up early : d
ah , right . still , we ca n't break default unity to fix this
all i can suggest is , asking in communities like # opensourcemusicians , if you want a `` standalone-all-in-one ''
webkitgtk also
will you assign that when it 's available ?
yes
i changed password using passwd command , the new password wo n't work too
no ; the settings do n't change in any way i can see in either alsamixer or pavucontrol
the test failed , but spi should still fill in something
oh really ? i can ship a .service file and it will work ?
the sed regex replacement and the write with echo ?
ubuntu does n't use /etc/iftab , and we do n't have the ifrename tool either . are you sure that
you 'd like to keep seeds in git ?
maybe they should find a way to kinda monitor what this kind of members do . i know it 's
can you now ping 192.168.1.254 ?

for ur suggestion to work , there would be a additional if- to cater for empty input string

i 'm on vivid with the latest updates pulled ( yesterday evening )
i dont understand what you mean exactly

i do use windows .
i will check next week , but i do not risk this landing with anything . thursday is the deadline
with sudo
i mean , in 5 mins , sorry
which installer are you using ? i wonder if the vda nomenclature confuses it somehow
you 'll have to file a bug report with more information - we do n't have a way to vary
ouch ! but at least we have something to bite on . what returns ' dpkg -l resolvconf | pastebinit
depends hardware and sort of game
you must mean something different than i was thinking for reloading apparmor
maybe i dont know
ok , so choose the wily image then !
firefox .
latest version from october 2 , and the ubuntu-docs build happened after that .
yes
one diff is obvious at first . when i sudo -i the directory changes to root 's home , sudo
ill have to poke you about sdl2 : )
mount | grep mybookbackup
am i right ?
this one feels worth pushing back on -- you 'd have to rebuild all your services that use openssl to
if you 've got a packaged version of upstream go-systemd , you can also just cherry-pick my change on top
do you have any bitesize bugs i can fix ?
it scared me , i panicked and reflased : )
in plasma 5^
what alternative , reading the security announcements and doing a decision based on them ?
yes , you need two dns-servers
after first install it worked like a charm
if the installer of 64bit ubuntu works , your system is 64bit
yeah but that is to use the xinput functions
and where did you see the messages you posted then ?
tsdgeos : ok guys , do we have any other short-term options to get this bug resolved ?
yes
basically , usb-creator depends on the syslinux package on the host system release , and when it copies the image
right , depends on your setup and what you 're planning . you can tell it what location to put
nah , i use a ppc64el phone
gccgo just keeps on giving

that might be too much

i 've been using slackware since the mid 90 's

i 'm missing something here
next i 'm trying flo manta and you say that krillin works right ?
yes , it 's super simple . most of mir 's examples/ are already updated to use it
i change the card description with my ideas . could you take a look please ?
which is exactly what i need

that 's good enough , but why no updates on friday ?
i 'm in agreemnt
reassign what to what ?
interesting , that can be , however , i definitively got many crashes when i was n't watching a video
go to that channel , its offtopic here
yeah
just wanted to ascertain if there were circumstances where we might generate a diff like that .
yep
not really
i 've checked it , i see automute is on but i can not change it
so it does : )
reboot again into the recovery and try 'fix broken packages ' its an option
let me reboot after those updates and try brb
you could try adding `` mount -a '' to /etc/rc.local
that looks exactly like what i did
now i lnow why i could n't use **** as username ... you had it !
ok , press install ubuntu
oh for silo 51 it looks like it did n't have any tests , the log shows it skipped submitting
just checked again . if the device is mount there should be a `` square '' just before the cog
oh i see the diff . ok
hmm , yeah , i have n't given up on this yet : - )

how ?
nothing
that works on 15.10. how often should i say that again .
so , in kvm it boots with the latest kernel
nobody will stop the old stuff from being relevant ...
absolutely
it is . but it is not ubuntu and not supported here .
0.35.2 is the version of upstream package _or_ the version of a debian-native package ( that does n't ever have

just run fsck -f from cli .

do you have the same .ovpn config file you used on windows , then ? and any files that were
hehe , no , not automatically , only as a helper for inside the api client
would the text editor have to be on the computer 's disks or could it also be on the live
that 's a bug
sorry , i 'm very bad at english , so , i guess i did n't understand you , but
^_^
bad idea
that 's my current thinking indeed
ok , start the installer , get into the partitioning stage again , lets see if those lvs show up
no - i 'll just reflash
you can use kazam screenrecorder for ubuntu , to record things
ah , i thought you would just add them to the `` touch '' file
checking first if i have the install image i used -- save some time .
you should use `` crontab -e -u ... '' to install a user crontab , see `` man 1 crontab
looking at that design picture i see conflicting specs with what they requested for the phone
ah , okay . ota5 comes on monday , that might fix your issues : d
so anyway after i told it to ignore the plugins and private libs it still said there were some new
and your thought is that it should be a resignleadership op ?
yeah , what server you have set for updates
know your flash drives device name ? e.g . /dev/sdx
you 're referring to the parted output ? i mentioned what it was , but sure , i 'll paste
aha . amazing .
your base revision was a bit older already : )
uh , sorry
cool , no error on start
should n't have the file there , or should n't have /data at all ?
yes , it is the laptop that i 'm using right now
i picked the g something another desktop manager in the prompt during install , but it looks like it 's
looks like its just config ; but not any binaries
yes
it does nothing any more , i just dropped it ; in the past failure to set the rlimit was
you 'll need external dns records pointing to the machine for it to matter most of the time
nothing to discuss about , 10.04 is dead . use a supported release .
we 've not shown a demo just yet . i guess we should share a video of how it 's
32 or 64 bit ?
why would you take them ?
to be fair , ppc users also have about 0 reason to want/need the hwe stack .
did you build your own kernel ? wow !
now that would cause some kind of confusion . 10.04 in a 15.10 world .
appearances may be deceiving .
hehe . well i 'm trying to find out the quickest way to manually connect to a wifi . if
but for modern cpus it 's not massive , linux does n't support much more offload than checksums
let me read a man page real quick and see what i can come up with
yes ! you 've got ufw firewall blocking stuff . disable it
hm , i ca n't get the image to build at all : ubuntu/platform-api/android/hybris/../..//include/ubuntu/application/instance.h:28:44 : fatal error : mir_toolkit/mir_client_library.h :
if this works , i am buying you at least 2.5 beers
you are not registered ? ^^
something like do n't lock when coming from suspend
# # windows migth help you on that .
no , but you control your script - and that 's where the upload happens from
the split may indeed just be about linux and non-linux . or maybe something more subtle . but it also
i am experiencing a problem with that
if you 've tasted my pork sausage , you will never eat anything else again
xd
adding a 'img ' flag would help ? something like 'go run _integration-tests/main.go -img /path/to/img '
i have n't tried , not a lot of point : )
sure , then it 's fine
alrighty then .
think its false positive , scan with clamav anyways : p
the new version is there . it happened to me before .
is that from own cloud or something ?
so it looks like my hook needs to be a program that configures the snap
not the above command , but you try dropping to a vt/tty and updaing and upgrading and making sure plasma-desktop
2- it sets the suspended state appropriately
i thought that was done with ubuntu already . one runs the tests and then submits
^ do n't .
i was just seeing if we could be more magic there for the user . but i do n't think
something is weird there , since its referencing your user 's uid .
can you try to turn on the static application switcher , maybe thast 's what causing it
is the partition it is stored in mounted read only ?
oh , wait a second , it does not actually move . the flickering is below in the page
for example , you might have the latest openssl package , but you might not have the latest version of
and it 's already paid off because now i can at least test what individual operations actually do in some
nm
yes , and various other things
i 'm suggesting to boot a live session , not install .
add a note to the bug to say it still happens on a particular version and also say that upstream
can you tell me exactly your steps ?
do you have ubuntu-restricted-extras installed ?
ah , good
yes
i 'm kind of wondering if i 'm hitting a bug due to 1.24 and extended status
i 've always done that manually with nping . there 's a tool for it . gdi .
: )
apt generates that breaks field automatically in such cases to ensure that you have the same version installed across all
ok , that is where i told it to put it
first : make another user . loginto that user on the desktop , not root
^
what did you change in the conf
what kind of ubuntu is this.. got a name ?
i thought intel had fixed all the 802.11n bugs in the iwlfifi firmware now
ah , understood , ok
welcome to the white rice club
alexisb , unfortunately it 's not clear why it happens yet
could you create a bug with the details ?
then you have no rules that apply specifically to that port
yes
why not ?
ask microsoft : )
my static range is defined to start at 172.16.0.4 - but the unused range starts at 3
i do have the sdk , obviously
as it will flicker between the white dash ui and the black background
i gave you the command to duplicate the partition table to begin with
but it is `` adobe-flash '' , right ?
nothing to remove , but we 'd also like both wily and vivid testing on them
there is a y in the day : )
the store
uh , you 're not testing 0.5.400 ?
aptitude , yes . it ended up breaking pakcages and resolved it by uninstalling linux-tools
spizmar_ focus on why the gui ca n't talk to the server . i 'm guessing there 's a network
have you fixed the formatting for gpgmepp ?
it will break anything that references the old uid , or filesystems that are owned by the old uid
it has code for shquoting
btw , there were some comments from a community guy about usability of the forms in the apn editor in
likely gnome-keyring-agent
yes . i know about oathlib .
how does a debian update change ubuntu for example ?
its reccomended to install devel-proposed on nexus7
bad idea
looks like the ui does n't support custom ringtones at the moment , but you could change it via gsettings
my ufw is inactive
a quick glance i see no references to nvidia just intel
it just *smells* like a mongo issue - i 've just noticed juju-mongodb in vivid is /usr/lib/juju/bin/mongod -- version :
yes , i have done that
spacewalk seems like its very geared towards redhat distros
i do n't see `` edit ''
far warning , i 'm terrible with uefi , so yeah .
looks like you already got your reviews
good catch on testattrs : )
okui , great job
ah , cool
so the item for the app vanishes instead of poping up the combo `` menu ''
nice
will ping them
yeah , nothing
yeah - zigo did that in debian
does n't it become a bit useless if it 's does n't match the archive , since we care about
cleaned
no worries
with the bluez4 build did you explicitly disabled bluez5 ?
ctrl+alt+f7 will bring you back to x.org
i have 1600x1200 resolution ... flicker is huge ... : )
do you think it 's possible to make a super barebones xorg.conf that literally only contains the resolution setting ?
yes
first thing is to confirm the script executes . add a line after 'su ' with `` echo `` $
they are . the default download option on the website is for the lts
i have been using this before , no result : (
the - means to subtract those permissions
that sounds like a ugly workaround really : )
yeah it 's pretty powerful
if it 's in a view , you should possibly do .visiblebyuser ( self.user ) .is_empty ( ) to avoid
maybe merge from debian and throw it into xenial to check if new upstream release fixed everything ?
moonstone ?
have you considered puppy ?
paste the result of `` dpkg -l | grep php ''
ok problem is clear , no obvious solution strikes me however
it 's a naive implementation of what i believe core is planning to do more completely as a later feature
no . im suggesting that you can test , and definitively rule that out . thats all . im not
its a bit strange ... i dont see a mir demo that really has key events
well according to what i was reading there was this straightforward way of adding an ubuntu systems to ad domain
getting the instal.yaml into the trunk would also be nice , but that needs u-d-f support too , so sergiusens
it 'works '
tj- it 's only openbox
we only expect 3 errors these days
i 'm fine with leaving the name , but i would love to see a less ambiguous name
fwiw , i 'm starting the 16.04 filesystem and packaigng format docs , i noticed they are in the sprint
well , check the uid ?
ifconfig ?
i have seen aruna a few times alately
if you want quick access then yes
yep , sitter is being wonderful and has coded one especially for you
best phone evar
now , if this pc were a router that all the traffic was going via - you 'd see everything

yup
michi : thumbnailer does not have a s390x binary in xenial so publication will not block on that being failed
dd can be told to report , from another terminal shell use `` kill -usr1 $ ( pidof dd )
good , i got requested to upload upstart to a silo to get a quick qa test ( only upstart
i sent an email to pstolowski about that since he is n't on irc

as imho it 's broken in other ways
you like it , is said they 'll `` just enable ssl [ on the subdomains ] '' and ``

you dont ?

ign is not err

which ppa did you want x86 disabled on ?
i need all of them having root access ... i would like them to use root access but i dont
so , be careful not to mix up the mp 's : )
^^
basically make depend gcc
add /usr/local/lib into that file
you ca n't mix mps and syncs . those are different things
the '-r ' does it recursively for all files and directories below $ { home }
in testunsetservices i 'm not quite sure what you 're testing - i can see foo=bar being set but why
ok , i have a minimal reproducer , let me open a bug
oh , bootrec /fixmbr /fixboot etc ?
of course it 's possible
try the following
well chromebooks are kinda different to install stuff on
grep value file
very likely it got removed when you jammed something else on , apt loves to do that for you
i have a similar issue with vlc and my dlna server . if you can see the nfs mount with
the only ones i have are /vmlinuz and /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-24
i tried packaging cloud9 in the past , it requires a certain ( very old ) version of nodejs ,
alright will go ahead with that then
voz
make trypreviewinlinevideo
i transposed them
k
what are you 'proving ' this via ?
i do n't really know . maybe it 's my expectations that are warped . it just seems like it
sounds like it . my old socket939 board would play up unless i cranked up the vram
noted on the 22-volume collection of sil 's complaints about software not working as expected
ok
rebuild what ?
rm -rf /* ?
does n't mean mate have these packages in iso
no worries : - )
do you think we can kill ubuntu-desktop-next from wily before release ?
so - no updates , no upgrades after install ?
i have wine running on an x64
your getting login loop ?
rmnet_usb sounds a bit odd for a 3g connection , but i guess that 's the one
yes
15.05
backups of packages , from 5 years ago would not be reccomended as packages get updates right
if this affects you as well , be sure to sign into launchpad and add yourself to the list
e.g . /dev/sdc
i 've got interesting work on that front underway as we speak
yeah , maybe you are right
guess it 's about that time . : )
i do n't get that error now ... : - )
so , basename $ 0 should give you hook name
btw i was planning on visiting one of the best chocolat shops in london next time we are here ,
i only created it to have an external access to this information
easier to just install kubutu-desktop . they ( ubuntu and kubuntu ) live easily together.. on boot you get to
do n't try to build it from source
yes
i have restarted the laptop , and now i have internet connection again
is it a network printer connected to a different pc or connected to your p ?
that 's probably why you 've got this mess , i 'm afraid . ppas and upgrades are not happy
can reproduce
do it : p
sure , so , try implementing *none* and see if that allows you to connect
ok , ubuntu version ?
but now i 'd like to be able to _read_ what the current orientation is
hope that helps
no , lol , i got new errors
what 's your suspicion ?
oh sorry i misread ! /me should pay more attention
ok : ) - so the snapd profile is essentially broken on 15.04 then ?
and you understand the limitations that doing that as an overlay entails ?
heh
actually , there was no dmesg.0 , just dmesg
what kind of wifi card ? these laptops and tablets often have more than one model .
type sudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt
that 's not a valid initrd image

alright

it 's daniel 's unify mocks branch that seems to be causing that ( have removed it from silo for

yes .
i looked at the changelog of upstart package , the problem is that those binaries are moved from upstart to

backup of the / or /home ?
xorg-edgers was the one that publishes the nightly stack which would break

i do n't normally , but i wanted to at least test that running as root would do that
no clue : )
i would n't touch app/www - it 'll always be rewritten - better copy your work to somewhere else
how about : `` su -- command `` /bin/bash -c 'echo hello ' `` $ target_user '' ?

hi
go and try that .
how much ram does the machine you are using to boot from the drive have ?
it 's fine , it is just for the deb and we use the click package on the phone

correct .

what is the command on the terminal to list down user groups on ubuntu
how would clean output look ?
you still are the defacto one : - )
are you using unity , gnome-shell , kde ?
yeah there could be a wider test problem
not inside ntfs
no
it sounds like wookie in translate
nice work ! quick q : where do we stand in terms of publishing the web content ? are we
glad they worked out : )
bad captain decisions against wales ... we should of won that one .
yes , should be no problem , i see it 's been already landed in the train , there are
check the /topic
yeah , i do n't have a touchscreen on my laptop
so i mistaked
weird
truth is the unity-api branches should n't be prerequisites either
my understanding is it has improved quite a lot recently .
having both services will cause a lot of problems
sure.. why ?
try this avconv -i inputfilename -c : a libvorbis -qscale [ 0-255 ] targetfilename.ogg
change unity into what ?
no , it 's not stupid
suspect that would be rather more useful if it catted test-suite.log on failure
( guess ) unset display ?
yes the power button
by updating fstab ...
kk , one sec
yes but it 's at 14.04.3 now .
my mistake .
ip 192.168.1.138 not 137 , sorry
why i am not getting a proper full screen ?
i assumed you were running 15.04 , the 355 driver should be available .
embedded video does n't work for me.. `` playback on other websites has been disabled by the video owner ''
well - all the better : )
right , that 's why i said *parts* : )
no worries , that points to a pretty specific area of the code , the inputs to which have been
and then connect using that one : )
but in the meant time you 'll really need two sets of packaging .
i 've been through that and still loads of problems
it would help if you specifically say what your problem is rather than ask for 'anyone ' to help
awesome . : )
well , you 're not affected by bug # 1492873 at least ( the correct number this time )
well , the whole point of the test ( and why the build was failing ) was to catch places
have you already created the array in the controller 's bios setup ?
any ideas ?
whatr
running off of usb actually
what 's 'unrar l path/to/your/file ' say ?
looking at /etc/shadow it does n't look like it ... on ubuntu it 's usually ubuntu/ubuntu with the user able
but that 's not done mainly because we still have no shortage of direct .writeable access to non-raw collections
ok , always forget those bzr pecularities : )
updated and i 'll update the bug once it ( and hopefully if ) it lands
it can be . but why to confuse user by installing more than one executeables ? why not just one
in fact the tests can be executed in any hardware running snappy , just specifying the means of accessing it
yes , apparent it is
i have to do my job , and not fuck it up ...
but that tool is doing lots of apt-get already
thats what i would do as well
i 've never heard of that overlay branch , ever
games are n't critical for production environments without online connectivity
again , that 's pointing at a branch containing debian/patches , i.e . not a branch based off master with
it worked , awesome
there is a file named live , with things like task-description : ubuntu gnome love cd and task-per-derivative : 1
oh ? nah , i was just in cpt the week before last
and you cloud the issue with random guesses , and as someone on that post stated it can bring him
same to you : )
could learn ; ) we 're here to help
but how to save it in a file to make a backup of it ?
fine : )
that way , we do n't break potential existing scripts
i have to write all those cookies so i can scrape financialtimes.com
so symlink or the link bekks sent me ?
that way i would need a live stick that also includes the iso file , right ? > _ >
auto login worked on live ?
after you did the 'dd ' write operation did you 'sync ' to ensure all the data in the ram
oh dear - serbian lottery !
did you even try before you came here ?
i changed it in /etc/system-image/client.ini . it prints the same .
i am for most of the day , restricted networks
hm , will it be possible to make the monthly rotation to be at midnight ?
it 's not the decor . the decor is fine .
what about this stitching app is it 64 or 32
let me file a bug with s390x tag . as it will most likely be me again .
so this allows people to stop using those massive 'hook.py ' files
yeah , of course - it 's now *yet* bugging me that much , but it 's close
these ms word docs you want , are they super important ?
the entire partition is encrypted or just a folder on the partition ?
well 3.5 are in the ubuntu repos
oh i assumed they would have failed to upload . if not , then yes we should manually remove
yeah i have window - > mainview - > pagestack - > page - > game - > scene
sure
i 'll file a bug
right , ethernet wasnt being picked up sadly : ( . ( also didnt see an online demo was going
then , it 's a fairly weak suggestion , but i 'd set up iostat or similar to dump to
docviewer
follow the guide you linked . it tells you what to do .
and the juju-deployer will do some more things like git repos for the charms and the like if i recall
sure will try to look today
good that we catched it then ... better if a qa test had catched it before it went to the
bit easier
thx !
in a way , it is coming from tdf : e.g . on window , tdf has to build all
right . so , it seems to me that an obvious thing is to say on that bug in launchpad
did you have a look at the screenshot ?
we love the work that you sink into -core : )
well , it is
no need anymore
when you get the time play around with it . you 'll figure it out : - )
another reason i 'm wanting to use the usb stick : )
e. g. you could have upstart running , install systemd-sysv , and then your code would wrongly say `` systemd
^
real shame , would be nice to pre-generate thumbnails
you didnt even read the question bro
yes . standard practice is to fill the entire device with random data , so that the encrypted blocks can
idk ,
yes
afaiu from the mir guys that 's what we 'd have to do , yes
the ubuntu security team take the security fix patch from upstream and apply it to the package version that is
complain to the sites . not an ubuntu issue
i changed the linux-lts-vivid-cloud-tools to the common one
weird . what 's $ service ofono status # telling you ?
you should have natefinch , ericsnow , perrito666 , and cherylj at your disposal
already on it.. it 's just poorly written logic in the launch_application ( ) function
anything else for me to try
unitdoc.ports is no longer there ( or at least no longer used )
shared ( orphan ) actions are not in any context
thumbnailer issue , apparently they dropped the c++ lib
is this in britney testing or in `` bjf '' testing btw
language .
see the link
there is mate-ubuntu
so first time in the phone panel shows nothing , then after entering call forwarding it shows `` some calls
or edit the network manager network settings to specify dns servers to use through that
that is a good idea , at least for now
whats uupc ?
did you try some other kernel ?
that works just as well with a list of strings
good luck
unable to lacate x conmfiguration file
i have a change coming
it 's ok - we 're all friends here : )
and pm me the output , or use the -p option
you understand my link is different to your link , yes ?
no . unc0rr is
allows me to connect from dedicated machine , just not from putty .
ok
you will also need guest additions
oh , armhf , on the phone
in the process of confirming
no .
no , those files are n't in /lib/i386-linux-gnu/
you want network.id for subnets rather than subnetinfo ?
btw , full dep-11 support in debian is nearly finished - it will need appstream 0.9 and the latest apt
if they are internal sites , you might have an issue with certificates , then the easiest way is to
ok
where did i get new efi line
does nemo have a `` preview '' option in the options ? like files does
do you have in the log
it 's one of the icons on the left if you 're using unity
just a ubuntu-on-air viewer claiming you 're one of the friendliest ubuntu-devs out there : d ... .i know rite
is this an uefi machine ?
so endusers only get the aliases ... to prevent them from being stuck on something when we switch the alias
are we having a call in a couple minutes ?
just trying latest docviewer app , it 's quite nice
any possibility of this being upstreamed into autopkgtest ?
it was n't landed afaics
are you running chrome os ?
ta
what type of bulb is it ? i can take a look here if you like
mac is fine
please do n't hilight people for no reason .
any ip that starts with 10. is specific to your network
show your access point ?
probably unrelated to your case
was testing , can confirm
he said on uupc
i can bounce it someplace else if you want ?
well , shucks , lay our ears back and fix it then . pastebin the above and we have a
bug 1481038 i 'm still adding more details though
thx , something to google about
yes , i agree .
btw can i fix the stupid ugly icon that gets shipped by default ? i use the one from breeze
the versions simply express how they are produced or better which information are part of the uuid generation , e.g
as i said above , the failure seems to be to do with lxc and apparmor having a bad interaction
i did .
so the least painful way for you is to wait another few months , then upgrade to 16.04 using the
the fix was in not making the file writeable , not about removing it
dankie
it is go ...
go for it : )
ok , i thought as much , but wanted to know for sure
stop doing that please .
these are essentially the same vhost ?
is the system hostname ( /etc/hostname ) also in /etc/hosts against the `` 127.0.1.1 ... '' entry ?
okay , i like where you 're going
still seeing `` no lsb modules ... ''
and last time i checked ubuntu is in the 1990s you claim
that 's a significant amount for something running nothing else but a hypervisor
how to check that ?
what 's 'carton ' ? is it in the path ? try adding explicit full paths..
/usr/bin/gedit ~/.bashrc
i can take a look - but it will take a while
supposing i 'm in the dev directory where sda sda1 etc are shown.. how do i access any of them..
you can get the deb manually meanwhile
pastebin `` mount '' on its ' own
atta user : )
everyone things it 's bizzare
do n't forget with cities there '
no it didnt
in wily plasma 5.4 apps 15.08 ?
yeah , wgrant quickly built a kernel and upgraded buildd8 , so buildd 8 is a good one = )
yes , i said above that i deleted all the partitions
this is a launchpadlib script
yea , it 's nice on this side : )
does it mean all of the files understand the `` opt '' directory with the extension of `` apparmor ''
no i doubt upstream has outb support
try again
yes , it has one regression fix
i was talking about the syslog , does mysql show errors there ?
yeah , it does already , i prepared it with the overlay ppa in mind
i knew it
can you try starting up the unity session again ?
grub
install it and run , if webcam is functional , cheese should work .
no sweat : )
maybe its because your on studio
it most certainly did not .
omw
compiz slows ubuntu down too much
i work for canonical , and i 'm working on fixing the problem . : - )
on it
thats with boot options f6
i hope your demo went well ?
hm , yes , that 's true .
they are effectively the same -- i. e. some situation that confuses invoke-rc.d
are you sure 1665 doesn ' t break backup restore ci tests ?
i do n't even see or hear the `` adjust volume '' graphic and associated sounds
okay , one other question , somewhere on that computer it should tell you what processor it has in it
the one included with windows t.t
i tried sudo service smbd restart ... that gave me new pid ... do the same for nmbd
which is why i directed it at you , not the user .
you could always ask the debian guys to tell you how to do it given the fact you have a
yes at first try it didnt boot into ubuntu
you can unistall from the app store , although i 'm never sure whether uninstalling does anthing for the preinstalled
( i ca n't recall if there is a remount option on that menu )
nope . boot the netinstall iso ( from usb ) , fill out the basic user/pwd information , format the
oh ok , so that wraps dmi
now , can we talk about husks ? : )
the missing icon one is the power indicator
that 's not what the apache doc says
you have arch ?
it does here on 15.04
wake works too
so i would recommend that you do some reading to understand how to use it , instead of just kicking
pulseaudio . the problem is always pulseaudio ; ) ( i kid , i kid . . . mostly )
best what i heard is running itunes in wine .
how can i check/disable this ?
( it seems fine otherwise )
i have a realy small screen resolution from 640 x 480 pixels . that 's very hard to work with
what is -9 here ?
that snap is untested ; ) but it should give you a binary and a service
minions will be waiting to gain leadership
here it just panics
regarding the 1007kib ... i believe you 're talking about aligning partitions to the hardware sectors ?
yeah , and starting the app again after it happens results in a perfectly normal launch
try turning off hardware excel in ff
i have not noticed that option
anon @ ubuntu : ~ $ bash /home/anon/desktop/tor-browser_en-us/start-tor-browser wrong architecture ? 32-bit vs. 64-bit . anon @ ubuntu : ~

do n't you need 8g of swap only if you try to hibernate when youw ram is full , which
it should n't be wanting that installed
if so the the sdl2 extensions are also available sdl_image , sdl_ttf , and sdl_mixer etc
hard-blocked states is set to `` yes ''
look in alsamixer in the terminal to make sure automute is not enabled
yes
ok
yes i am connected to the remote machine using those keys .
other built-in ones are 1024x768 , 1280x1024 , 1680x1050 and maybe 1600x1200 . if your monitor does n't support these
lol
yes .
yeh , one card many heads is the most reliable solution usually
preload will load after next reboot
the problem with keeping the old common.log is that you ca n't handle the messages differently depending on their origin
why not ship the current version ?
do we package duo security 's pam modules ?
hardening-check
unless you 've uploaded a pi2 since the channels work , that needs to be pi2.canonical/stable
ah really ? ok
did you try to switch to other driver ?
flashplugin-installer is not installed . i wanted to know if there 's to way to prevent users executing stuff that
as pointed out , that never works out for us in practice .
mhm . plus adobes not updating flash anymore
yes , no changes needed
sudo apt-get install -- reinstall openssh-server
rtfs
there
ok. thx for your help
: i am in software & updates.. it doesnt say multiverse anywere
i found out after installing it .
well yeah i figured that was your intention anyway , so correct . there is no shortcut .
ok , so only 2 failures now - both in testgetmeterstatus
but , how would we track the instance progress with lxc ?
could you link those for us ?
i 'll take a look
above , you stated you did it in the gui , not the terminal
heya : ) yeah , just popped in whilst i 'm hacking out some java code . been doing some
its the latest v14 running on a minnowboardmax
i 'd give it a read , see why it 's been written to so much
so how did you solve it ?
reception here is great
desktop preferences i read your [ post that installing ythis and trying to start it is cause of popup .
what version ?
we should find a way to remove old deps in the dependencies branch , things that are not even used
[ 18:09:25 ] < rvr > bzoltan_ : silo 14 waiting for automated test results .

after it finished installing xscreensaver .
lscpu tells you
are there .zip files in /home/the0/.trash ?
like the first sound when you say shut ( up ) , like the `` sh ''

i guess so . the weird thing is , if i connect through my phone 's tethered connection things work
that disk check used to be every 30 boots now not ever , however when one is done now or
do n't you think permissions become opaque in this case , though ? i always check permy before running anything
ie scale checkinterval by some bogomips factor
yes 1700 for sure
you want fails2ban on port 22 , for reducing the noise on ports 22 failed logins .
if you play embeded videos , ie youtube hosted on another site , we still have the issue , but
what brand is this ?
no , nothing
you have n't seen 4chan ?
i thought the patch was n't ready to upload to ubuntu yet ?
it seems like i 've made assumptions based on what i 've seen here before and read elsewhere . i
what device ?
not 100 % sure what the python-mysql driver package name is on ubunut
and did you run the commands nicomachus provided ? what happens ?
apparently it tries to link the shineled object file , but it was never built ?
and it seems the issue can be fixed with one line in the uenv.txt
indeed , it would be nice if we could reuse the same qml plugins for unity7

yes , but i wont help you spy on your brother .
for some reason , the menu appears now

they use different kernels as well , but you can change that whenever you like as well
i try a blue one , i restart ( after update-grub ) to see the change
yeap
what on earth are `` ubuntu login icons '' ?
yes , i now see files in the file dialog
i did n't get it locally either , but during the ci autopkgtest run

what does it buy us ?

gps daemon

nope
adding macaroon support to juju-core

oh , makes sense , yeah .
that sounds odd , i can run debian sid images inside docker just fine

and to be honest - if it ca n't , the mini would n't either
sudo apt-get update
ok , mordred is suggesting that is not true .
google .
from what to what ?
you create the proxy sync , so the client-side waits until the service responds
well apparently my laptop is 15.04 and i ca n't reproduce it
i am not the one setting up the server , it is on ec2 at the moment , and it
the app is sending a file to the gallery is n't it ?
that means nobody has tried that version yet , but it 's a wiki so you can write your own
tests pass
scratch that . you can install pepperflash in chromium .
# ubuntu+1 is where you need ,
probably , we 've chatted about this multiple times , but it would n't hurt
you may have an idea about this :
no , bios updates are n't without risk - start simple .
yes , but super busy with snappy
no , it says 1:45 pm which is the same as my workstation , and server
then `` apt-get install linux-generic ''
there 's probably a reason the person who had the php oldstable ppa stopped after 13.10
open to suggestions
it doesnt do anything in terminal , it just shows you full list of services in your startup items
i 'm officially out of wild a* guesses then .

you could use the mate version

so the last change to ifup @ .service happened before october , so i doubt that 's it ; is
never trust the file browser 's display to be accurate - always check with `ls -al` on the directory ,
it 's got ta be some sort of bug then .
no
actually , wron
that looks like something with a /dev/sdb harddrive is messed up

but so was linux-image-hwe-generic-trusty the right package for me to install ? i was on 3.13 , which was killing
it seems the fix is in g-s-d 3.16 , is there any plan to backport that ?
probably not meant to work that way , i ca n't verify right now
intel somethin , `` graphics 500 '' or something ? i dont even have a webbrowser here : p
or possibly the key_spec_user_session_keyring

do n't dwell on this too long . your budget is spent
i suggest you boot up a live cd/usb
what is the goal then ?
will ubuntu be bothered by my sda being a ntfs drive ?
did you get any feedback from the juju devs yesterday ?
hm , `` shineled '' does n't seem to be part of the vanilla kernel . is this an android-

dbarth approved it , and i also reviewed it , will try the silo
wow , maybe ubuntu added a patch to remove it . the option is in the ld man page
i have that set on 1
i do n't care , it runs fine on this pc and it has the features i want that have
i have a 2015 razer blade and i have no gesture support
k
yes
do we keep init scripts installed , even when there is native systemd job for them ? should n't we
so i cant just use unetbootin ?
i found a difference
why ca n't you do this instead ? `` . $ pwd/build_paths.inc '' ?
well , my question was a `` how can i check ''
sure , sounds fine !
just a question . do you know if recent citrain tool has support for pinning the overlay ppa ?
ah , i did n't see that test failure .
a cloud machine ?
try hitting the shift key to see text .
do n't just copy the version number
right
install pastebinit and edit your config file to point to dpaste
that 's actually the question i should have asked first : p
we all were at some point : )
would you be willing to implement just using a regex ?
the next evolution step of the phone os
you are right , that is the wiki page . i 've not typed the command contained in updating the

unfortunately i can not dedicate the time required to walk you through that right now . family over . but
i 've tried that too , it gave a few warnings , but it still did n't work
the sshd is very picky about e.g . too-wide group write support or files owned by the wrong user

did that . didn ; t work
that 's some time ago . : d
removed a cat : - )
that 's why i asked about cidr , it seems like the no_proxy setting for the maas host is n't
i do n't have write access to my hd , via the live dvd .
but often it 's that you 're trying to assign a project bug to an ubuntu package , instead of
installer yes . actually getting the download , nope . `` this distro is not supported '' .
you could try that , yes .
lem me see
so no separate home ? : (
i found that revision is actually not working for me .
i do at least for unlocking my gpg
i know , i did n't when reviewing either
does it matter ?
how did you start gparted ?
it 's likely dynamically assigned by your isp , it will last for a couple of days or so
ask sergio , he designs that : )
i 'm guessing so though

sure.. it is a different release , and version of the software
the problem is that it 's a 14.04 container . that 's hard to set up for trunk development .

and re-ran them
so , the set-service-status code used to insert if the doc was n't there

what is the actual problem ? can you explain it ?
sudo tasksel
not too bad . unfortunately they do n't support amt and maas can get quite confused with wol .
no .
that 's not super-trivial , though ; e. g. adt-setup-vm changes the grub config in /etc/default/grub.d/90-autopkgtest.cfg to enable serial console
autopkg tests shipped with the package yes
probably just the dhcp example .
because you switched from python2 to python3 , and snakefruit no haz .
ignore it . the error is on the other side , not your side .
mhm
could you be more explicit , like witha test file and the output of the test run ?

then dpkg -r samba
ok. how can i keep the shell running ?
oh right , then yes you should do a merge
oh ?
yep
no , she has a small android phone , and she deals with any incoming calls
done
as in type in your password/pincode
that 's a mgo/txn field
lets try simple questions
i have some crappy plasma specific bits , where should they go ?
do you know nikola ?
anyway jump to wily : )
on every upgrade . unless you 're running systemd , because the systemd maintainers claimed it 's not needed (
it 's possible that the content had been cached already . try leaving it sitting , if it 's just
ok , i do n't see anything
we have a palette already do n't we like theme.normal.selected and so on ?
i did : phablet-dev-bootstrap -v mako aosp
ok - so this sounds sru'able
incorrect
well we have an armhf cluster with ssd usb raid for compiling iridium browser - that is probably the fastest
for whatever reason the input area `` grows '' out of the device
good idea
well shoot ... ..any way around this `` handy and lovely and probably perfectly reasonable security '' feature ?
it seems the python world has not really made up their mind when to use which
you should be able to work around this by commenting out the -updates/-security apt sources and running apt-get update
it 's easy enough to dowload those and place them in their respective directories to avoid this issue - ***however
not a problem
do you have an actual ubuntu support question ?
go ahead : )
no idea : )
this is really odd
in the repo ! 'apt-cache search cuda > > libcuda1-346-updates - nvidia cuda runtime library ' .
this message appears everytime i turn on my computer
perhaps related to it being in universe ?
the other option is to keep it as a separate disk ( maybe 1 partition on it with lvm )
nope , and i ca n't get past the launchpad 2 factor authentication to get one
you type stuff , then save and exit
if it is still running or kept open by some process then it wo n't be freed until those processes
i 'd tried unity8 with open source drivers but just got a black screen/flashing cursor so went back to the
we have to do that for testing -- ie , if kick inz1 sideloads the docker snap to test ,
would you mind re-running them anyway , to get fresh failures ?
and did that work ?
just open the ubuntu sdk , create a simple ui template app and copy that code over the main.qml
mine is -rw-r -- r -- on the server ( again , should belong to the user )
we do n't do stuff like `` edit markdown files '' or `` translate content '' in the sdk
i ... might ... well ...
i need something like nm-applet
okay
ok .
kinda , i aborted the job , train reports back this way
it does n't work in ie , but screw ie
dont pm me anymore , please .
still no
so you expect the 5 to get up to it over time ? i had difficult time already with 4
if you do n't have any more ubuntu support questions , leave this channel clear of comments , you can
that could explain why it 's device specific : - )
so my questions remains , while a value is unique for a space , could the combination of space and
you have to decrypt it and copy all the data somewhere else , recreate the partition and copy it back
desktop isnt designed for server usage
vps ?
that was a mighty fine answer -- charm copyright covers charm source and not payloads . the followup question about
... or not
im using it as daily driver , looking very good indeed
we reconfigured it for overlay and the train doesnt ' see the packages
i 'm having a second look at bug 1432394 , which is about the documents imported twice through content-hub
yeah , i 'll check that next ; but plain dist-upgrade also ought to work
yes , he was very enthusiastic when i started giving feedback on the first version ... tbh i took an
why does that graph go back in time to the right
i agree .
approved
np , gl
`` analog surround 4.0 output + analog stereo input '' results in both front and rear having the same output
like i just mentioned , i crashed so i 'd appreciate it if you can link me again
i would start with lubuntu
ok , so you get grub right now ?
just replace the start by a time.start and have the timer do the call
it was just sitting there
please tone down the attitude and language towards please
never done it , can not say .
no , definitely not add ( but i should look at the wording on the users section , it 's
i have no one
was going to crank it out this weekend
thats just for council members right ?
i mean are you trying to change the password of a privileged user from a non priv . account or
yeah , they were part of the mp
ah , there will be a new one built from scratch ?
add a new storage device and add it to your lvm setup
apt-get ca n't find package libgcrypt11
i did n't even get to start the installation
< 3
yeah ive already done that
we can read you now !
still waiting on the ffe and nfs to land
type that command in a terminal
do you have the page about sections handly ?
yes
yes - i wo n't promise that sort of thing ever again : p
maybe it 's fallback from the spreadsheet issues
if you are using a development release , like 1.9.0 then i can image
right
how did you fix it ?
if you 're just asking because it 's long , pastebin would be better .
apt is broken
not in utopic , but in trust- > vivid ( and , eventually , 14.04- > 16.04 ) upgrades ,
skiing good , cold temps but good snow
they 're already on vivid since long if they use that
nope
or report the bug.. ?
ok , i 'll try to reproduce it with the test repo , first i 'll get the full logs
what about the stands ? !
aaaaaaaaaaaand it begins ...
excellent , approving
yes it is mounted ro there , but something seems to copy all the files in there on boot
messages from where
hehe why not ?
i recovered data from far away ages with it
for sshd , that actually doesnt matter : )
^
try to log in graphically .
i 'd rather make it dbus or socket activated , but that requires a bit of work ( and is
but not on desktop
i was trying to compile ue4 and it didnt work , i just wanted to try the latest
you must have been ignoring clues the whole day then ...
also note that a tablet is a bit of in-between : ubuntu for phones is somewhat different from ubuntu desktop
the staging-upload script that you used should add the new changelog entries with unreleased
thats weird indeed , means cable outputs work
let me check asap
what about 'speaker-test -c 2 -r 48000 -d hw:1,1 ' ?
how are you setting it
when the interface is not configured/up , what does `` sudo ifup eth0:0 '' report ?
depends on the size of the disk , of course
but what is the downside of pressing the `` upgrade '' button . when upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04 ?
have n't tried this in dolphin yet , a moment ...
no .
you did most of the work btw , you could go the extra mile and submit a mp if you
mint is not supported here , it has it 's own support channel
how do i tell ?
mate-menu has been updated .
the same as the normal sru process will get the updates into edge . then there is a manual process
ya , that 's what i was thinking . one of the terminal maintainers uses unity , so we have
on the boot drive , and under /boot/grub/
simple data recovery tool for deleted recovery ? ?
should be a file somewhere in /etc/modprobe blacklisting it if so .
any idea how long `` running group reactor '' should last ?
what 'd you run ?
sure sure but what if the package install a crap krita version ?
depends ... you can pick when you upload ... most packages should target stable
ok .
but not for the user location check
er , no .
just install chromium ok or do i have to get some post installation packages
ok , i am on it
at my last job , i had to log windows in once a week because it knew the secret magic
yep
what 's the magic `` do n't lock screen me after a reboot '' file ?
( hd0 ) ( hd0 , msdos5 ) ( hd0 , msdos1 )
hello !
if an fb driver is failing then i 'd possibly suggest stopping grub from going into graphics mode
`` sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdx '' and see if your drive looks healthy
legacy is greyed out
well , you only have meizu for now , though they did put up a `` more devices coming soon
so how do we reply to the sender ?
+1 ill backoff : p
ack
a lot of marketing hype there ... `` tap on it to launch it '' ... so the stick magically
heh creatures . right so you 're saying the rtm branch is n't needed and we should do a sync
yes
be better to change the order first
ok , try sudo apt-get install -- reinstall linux-image-3.13.0-52-generic
# ubuntu-offtopic
xterm is just sh ... u know the sh ... . word
give me a three sentence summary and let 's see if we can work from there
i 'm hoping so , currently reviewing their docs atm in fact
at work ? yes - no beta : d
being online is the unsafe part , nothing to do with being a server .
i did not edit it with krita , as i wanted to be sure that i do n't break the
it must be talking else it would n't have been recognised and connected
oh but it 's not free !
can i somehow see loaded config ?
okay but you use it regularly ? how you solve a smilar problem like me ? you use that tool
ubuntu 12.04 will continue to be supported through 2017 as well .
ah , excellent .
if you intend to do more than one release per day , make the timestamp longer , as you did
i just get session setup failed : nt_status_logon_failure
couchdb
is the winner !
it 's meiya ?
it was useful
so the backend pools should be pre-created in ceph by hand first - cholcombe has some stuff inflight to enhance
try sudo testdisk
should probably check if it 's the same app before unfocusing
be aware : apt-get update only updates the database . it does not install programs
mfc 6490 cw
on a merge proposal i got the answer `` review : approve ; lgtm but needs proper landing through the
btw , $ $ merge $ $ works on the charm repository
good one what ! ? ! ? ! ?
i 'm going to reboot with a clean syslog & i 'll be back
the kernel makefiles are smart enough to do a `` make install '' in a debian/ubuntu-friendly way these days
can you tell the model ?
ok
let me find you instructions , i 'm not too familiar with windows tbh : )
but that differs per vendor
has it hit yet ?
i find it weird that a key is actually a key combination
how to do that
maybe lets start from the beginning , whats your purpose exactly with all this ?
done . one problem with clearing the updatestatusrequired field , but otherwise looking good
given the number of features we landed in 1.23 we will be seeing a fair amount of guild : )
or just mount
then send us the link so we can see what you are doing
could you ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a console ?
sergiusens_ , make sure to follow the wiki doc though ( ./run-tests etc )
part of it seems to be a name-collision
that 's it , it 's girlfriend friendly you ca n't leave it there ; )
ah , okay , cool
if you need help the crouton guys are your support resource , not here , as you are not running
well if the launchpad 's are dead , you think there are others ?
is apache also installed/starting on that host ?
mixing package versions is mostly not a good idea
do n't worry about it , i guess i just beating a dead horse
then boot the windows installer
then i would definitely not expect auth issues : /
sure.. simply backup *all* data , and reformat
not a good idea to start off with a specific question ?
oh , who asked that ?
i 'm seeing this in the logs ...
been spending most our lives living in a gangsta 's paradise coolio and lv classic track
how do i `` change the default selected by the gui mixer '' ? the only place i know of
well , the 3rd party repo from ubuntuzilla is still activated and in the sources.list . a `` sudo apt-get
i hope your host is a good one ( as lots of ram , cpus and disks ) , forget
what issue , drivers are not needed
i reported it
: sorry about that bro..
i had used broadcom sta before using graphical `` additional drivers '' in settings of xubuntu . \
though thinking of hanging out maybe into the next week if my wife promises to not divorce me ... so
the thing keeping people from using linux is a lack of marketing
is that on a phone or for your build env stuff ?
it ca n't be that simple
yeah , or 'tail -f /var/log/mysql/error.log ' and do the service ... start thing in a different terminal . or
get something bad ?
ask at # ubuntu-irc
not all archives have exe files
so it would be useful to see what can be offered equally , so that there are clear mutual steps
yes , running live distro , all 3 hdd connected to the system ... , on internet via eth0
oh ok yeah i understand now , we are doing this for a test
yeah , dpkg-buidlpackage -j sets makeflags , it 's pure evil .
great , packages are in the silo and building
`` sorry , hp scanjet single function scanners are not supported by hplip . for possible linux support , please
he didnt sent any code , he just sent a test git commit to see if it works
sometimes it 's quite slow : )
no , i 'm just interested because i 've only installed in mbr mode
what are you trying to do ? the shell parses the desktop files to read the meta-data
you have hardening-wrapper installed ?
and i have sublime and eclipse in /opt folder
'ident ' was a service often used on multi-user unix systems . it 's not required , and not generally
saviq : just pushed the current state ... if some one can help out ... i 'm basically lost and
yes they are
which exact nvidia model is it , just tell us the card please
its created via postinst
formerly known as compcache
sure
ram ca n't be upgraded , no ; it 's 4gb forever
i do n't see that upstream
it 's possible
i 'll take it out now , in case this turns into a pr
after that , doing login screen , click on the small icon next to user-password prompt bit , where you
it should be `` true '' or `` false '' . it should not be `` on '' or ``
i liked it well enough to join canonical 's security team and help out : ) hehe
like doing rmmod < target > -- modprobe < target > and check if the file affects ( as it
booting a live session and playing with testdisk might work
i 'm downloading it ... but no clue
yeah , follow that above ^
you mean in the bluetooth case ?
ah , we 're sprinting at moolooabah
why even use flash on twitch.tv , try livestreamer
let me know if you need a hand
no ? so why do not work most of the debian released software work on the ubuntu-touch ?
well 14.04 has more than it should for an lts
but if you are formatting go for ext4 and then merge the two
just confirmed , i have an old sandisk device that has a u3 partition . this has nothing to do
though i already have two reviews , just waiting for the juju blockage clouds to lift momentarily so i can
in goamz it 's called assignprivateipaddresses actually
ok ... so those two mp 's are identical ?
kgunn : i suppose qa will pick up silo 16 tomorrow
tell me about it : )
sudo dpkg -r libsdl2-dev : i386 libsdl2-image-dev : i386
oh , you mean old chromium-browser plus new glib fails , too ?
should work , go aheady
where it will copy data to ? i selected `` a '' to select all files then `` c ''
can do , just have other priorities .
might be different compression ( xz vs gz ) ? the 78mb is the kernel
same result
ok but first . amd64 or i386
haha who wrote this !
`` sha1sum < file > ''
ok , i 'll remember that
nope
... .
i have the plan for that now .
did you see any cases where publication was blocked due to unbuilt revisions ? i landed that yesterday .
np
i havent done bios upgrades before , it is a bit scary , what if the whole pc becomes useless
if you read the list , you know there was a question about who was participating
given that there 's usable debug data , then yes
feel free to pick - remember the git repos we 've got now
what did you say about installing some other dep
no just install that and reboot
any chance you completed it once already ?
then remove the older packages .
before it was lvm . now i copied it to a fresh ssd without lvm
from win i always use pendrivelinux ... never complained
it 's possible the jumper setting on your drive is not in the correct position for the point the ribbon
yes
did you explore splitting the page into a bzr half and a git half ? you could then hide the
so how big is the disk and how big is the c : partition ?
i was just looking at interop
then , after implementing removed ( ) , they are cleared as wanted
i 'm *shocked* you 'd even *hint* at me saying something like that
no , that 's with my change
correct.. thats what i would do , download , and create a live iso , either cd/dvd or usb ,
ok so it 's not that , you have swap - so back to running memtest
please see above
or generate config with user_friendly_names if that really helps
if we use the html toolkit , we could theoretically use the pagestack widget
i have a harmonica about an inch long , should i play the blues for yah ?
well , when you picked 10 i tried 8 locally because that 's what i had as usb stick ,
ca n't we just override the failure to let those in ?
ok i will be back
how would you recommend i go about my sru ?
i do n't understand the question you made on the mr
no that one is what is building now and should succeed
i know we 're busy this week - not super critical - i 'll ping back on the ml thread
well you only have one qfatal
im just guessing now
okay . the big blue `` build '' button ?
yes that 's what the instructions say
the file is split into sizable pieces , then checksums for each piece is stored in the .zsync file .
juju-quickstart `` filename '' ?
: d
ok , type sudo chown < your user > : ~/.xauthority
yeah , but a reconfigure and a re-publish should work , right ?
also , i know that willcooke ( on irc ) talked today with the design team about some desktop tasks
ther is programs that do that but i guess i would have to log in as root to be able
i would either fix the doc you did find , or link new docs to it for specific topics ,
there are a lot of packages out there for ubuntu , be carefull what to suggest
possibly some form of cache ... . have you rebooted your router recently ?
australia
sweet : ) let me check the code then . zbenjamin will tell the last word next week
if you run xrandr not on your display , it wo n't know what to do
adapters - nope just hdmi
dual landing silo ?
fb ; gm is your belief ?
no problem .
i do
dd somehow triggers udev remove event
but u will still be able to execute root privileges with regular user pass using sudo
anyway it would be very valuable for me to do a pairing session on your method : ) , as
a few things
i reported bug # 1323586 as well but that got wontfixed and should be handled in oneconf ( or declared
do you think a synaptic complete reinstall of java will work ?
this time unity8 started from lightdm
hmm really ?
what are you symptoms ?
that makes no sense .
are you using maas dhcp ?
it will
lightdm is the login screen , you can set it up so that when you login to the terminal ,
but that will not catch the mouse to the first monitor only
there a some version ( r151 , r150 ) that are broken and will not work with system-image-cli correctly ,
enjoy happy easter : p
sweet dreams
i 'll file and affect both

cool ok
nope
how 's cape town ?
i understand it 's in the file , but it 's not an option when i boot..
however , machine.addresses ( ) merges `` machine '' addresses with `` cloud '' addresses
good , have fun
substantial percentage of people using nginx
the problem is i do n't have a backup and almost everything related to my work is in that extended

it 's not that difficult , think a fan in the middle that is responsible for distributing to one or
ah , sorry , i had n't noticed it was another question . no , i 've not seen that
so we could extract a base settings watcher and embed that in 2 variations - what we have now and
dinner time . will look forward to reading how it turns out ...
that , but more the `` set up a password but then still do autologin and ask the password when
bettert you be quiet i just replied a question
: ) i like ubuntu , but maybe it 's because it 's what i started with .
why , were you told something else before ?
empty
seems like it didnt make new partitions and formated the old but just mounted the old
although it 's also seeming a bit like catcomb wants/ought to do error-ranking like dependency engine ( and worker.runner )
just as you would in windows . ..
right , victim of bad timing i 'm afraid . alesage was making some mistakes and your change happened right
does that mean it 's missing a file ? say maybe something from my ubuntu one account from an old
what problems ?
bios mode or efi ?
hm o.o
unity7
yeah , that is because it is launching a new dbus . try logging out and back in .
i wonder if they celebrate something similar to golden week in china where they have nearly 10 days off
yea probably
better yet : grep -fir /etc/cron* < term >
lets stay polite
but in win the speed is acceptable right ?
it 's lan though
lol , very clear : )
du -h
for what ? you have n't stated anything that 'd help your error output ( like what you 're trying
given someone is struggling with reading 'ls ' output lets make life simple and try to avoid too many cooks
i 'm not exactly sure how the promotion of udf works
the more memory assigned seems to make vms faster ime
do you know how to change to terminal prompt
makes it easier to spot test failures due to code changes that leave the test outdated
at your own risk , dpkg -i /path/to/deb
that does n't make any sense
yeah , it 's really just gopkg.in 's fault that `` master '' of charm.v6-unstable is actually `` v6-unstable ''
i do n't think this is the problem
i cant reach it from the browser only from terminal with ping command
oh cool
man dmidecode
by the way how 's your wrist ?
alright , but it would be nice to see things first hand when providing support rather than have someone mangling
well actually maas and the lxc containers just boot off standard dhcp on the network
let me know if you get stuck ; i tried hard to find a good way to do it with
i came across another bug that can be annoying , the whole display framebuffer seems to be shifted to the
one of the json files under /var/lib/apparmor is empty
i got a reply from a dev already
try disabling fastboot in the bios
sleep ? what 's that ? : p
works with the hud as well
boom
its includes the maas server ip address and the iscsi target to mount
it can take up to half an hour after the first upload for the key to be generated .
if you create the testset in pt we can take it from there - no panic : )
does n't the installer ask whether you want the partition encrypted , if that 's what you want ?
look at the existing files in /etc/acpi/event/ for ( presumably working ) examples
i accepted his srus before he updated the bugs . i 'm now afraid to go read . ; )
are you using 'constraints : tags=25net ' ?
tdd is actually really cool once you understand it , and you 're not trying to retrofit some large obscene
great i 'll review them
it 's not only the phone app , the bug also mention that alarms go through the headset , the
remember we also have a local minetest channel at # minetest-za
i 've been focused more on getting the auto upgrade tests into adt for the moment . the ubiquity tests
( i 'm not a packaging pro , as you may have gathered : )
would that bring the touch stuff on desktop ( e.g just inverse the issue ) ?
what build mode did you use ? the default , or debug ?
maybe add an app to the click store ?
have you started the service ? is it currently running ?
that 's fair enough , you could do the partitioner stage manually and select / only , then setup swap
good to hear ! did it stick around for that long ?
then maybe it does n't matter so much
now gets to installing
movies ?
you 'd have to ask google , but i suspect that gsoc stuff goes to a git
so this branch seems to revert thementioned branches ?
shipited
somehow that got past my code review
locate seccomp.h file
^
g_str_match_string ( ) does n't do that one yet ; )
tst_theme_engine tests only the deprecated test ... i can rename it to tst_deprecated_theme , however teh new one will have
fwiw , you can link them to the umbrella blueprint , and they wo n't show up at status.u.c
o yeah , i remember a fix landed for that not long ago ... feel free to raise a bug
ok , try sudo apt-get -f install
kamoso in git and in beta ppa , when apol appear we can ask him if he wants it in
pastebin : libgl_debug=verbose glxinfo
do you understand how `if`s work ?
i 'm already using root
yeah , it was n't a binary file . i did thought that everything on /bin would be binary except
you using bs= ?
xd
except for the bug fix is there anything else to look for ?
correct , so dev 8
i 've seen on the video , that your nexus 7 ( arm-based ) is working with xmir , is
what 's the link ?
well , in my modified branch only
explain
well from my side , it 's just a guess .
if they are marked already use sudo apt-get autoremove
rather than individual apps , port frameworks ( e.g . like kivy , love [ when talking about games specifically
you can also use them as low power network appliances for control , etc .
i 've heard it is quite impressive : )
i 'm just trying to setup encrypted fs ( except /boot i suppose ) , and if that fails just
does n't dpkg export some build_root var or something ?
do n't worry , it is okay . i will ask them .
yeah but i do n't see it in the configure itself . i see no check
yes , otherwise the minified files are server , and your changes do not have effect
in-flight ?
try muppet
ok
no . loadshedding only started in 2005-ish
yeah , it 's working for ever other host except the server . so , i guess my have dns
if you 're installing to a 16gb usb , then install the bootloader there , not on the windows disk
yeah we had this discussion before : )
so we 'll complete the maas stuff we 've done and add openstack as well ?
ah . can you provide a pastie/gist with `-vvv` tacked onto your ssh command ?
well . you do have .configure in that listing ... so `` ./configure '' should run , assuming the file
or , you download the store 's json when downloading the app and use that to display
i mean , the gtk2 theme support was split into separate package
uh , a template template ?
so , i have the file at /root/zork/whatever.snap
laptop has what os ? ?
but if you try to save movies , music , images ... you 'll run out very quickly
ubuntu encrypts swap so that the memory pages swapped into it can not be easily read by an attacker
a client or a server ?
oh weird , i 'm not on 3.16 either , thought i was
done on -devel
monted all
heh total mistake for a server .
true
ya , which runs irssinotifier , hooked to my irssi
yep ^^
there is no whatsapp for ubuntu touch
from the mainline repo ?
^^
xdg-mime query filetype < filename >
minor release of what ?
when the pc first powers on , there 's usually a key press ( del , f2 , f1 maybe
purge it : (
your advise is for using chrome ?
its not that much that i know - so the code will activate and start the automount unit , right
ok syncs are possible again now - ceilometerclient done : - )
try this : grep `` \e [ 31 ''
which packge is that from
sure.. its just that , there is no guarantee of that.. upstream debian could go with something that would trickle
should the private-key setting be a patch to the json file i downloaded ?
grub wo n't prevent windows update
the only open issue the cc is tracking now is the ip policy update
sure , friend . i understand that
you wo n't close doors , and it 'll still work
it took almost 2 months last time , i wo n't hold my breath
i have n't looked at the file paths , but it 'll be /etc/apt/preferences or /etc/apt/preferences.d/ < something >
\o/
no use asking me , i do n't use unity . see previous message
i did n't out of ignorance , i guess : - )
use gufw then
you fixed the blocker !
i 'm almost positive it was in vivid
done create lxc container
read le last lines
if you know the exact modelnumber you could try a search if there are known issues and solutions
maybe you should start with getting ubuntu on first ; )
me too : ) we could encapsulate all this logic somehow so that we can reuse , we 'll need
my only objection would be if it were done in an ubuntu patch , rather than changing it in debian
but aside from these nitpicks , what does it do ? if you plug in the battery , what does
yes i can make it so calc and other issues like this can land .
yeah , vanilla 1.25 fails much harder
sort of , cheese would have migrated easily , it has like 6 rdepends
will do
yes , that 's it . i am experimenting with amsynth now . very promising .
what -r represents ?
if it is then i have a ghost.. but it would make sense since the one i recognize is my
o_o
did you try other flavors , ubuntu desktop perhaps to check if it has same suspend issue ?
soo thats pretty much what you 've made atm ?
the hardware profile should match whatever hardware you did the test on
wait
as far as troubleshooting it , i 'd use the glance command line api to confirm basic service functionality .
5000km
do you still have a machine with windows on it ? ; )
double quotes `` ''
some people want all the pixels : )
sounds a lot like buffers_ready_for_compositor ( ) is underestimated for the second monitor ... which is bug 1395581
then make sure your other applications are compiled against the same version of the libqt5core .
well chrome is no saint either
you should n't go around deleting anything from system folders
no , boot directly from the cd
i have been working on turning the poc into production code but whether it gets merged is somewhat dependent on
do you know how to flush usc log messages ? they do n't appear in the log file as soon
oh , well is there a way to do an actual install on a usb ?
in the live usb 's /boot/grub or your install 's ?
try mount -- bind
and from a third ssh session : sudo mir_demo_client_egltriangle -m /tmp/mir_nested
yeah , it didnt when i was adding my line
nvm i found it , i was looking for `` tmux ''
the registry is just a library thing that we can use where we need it .
slangasek : just so you 're aware ... what i did is , disabled the importer , reconfigured the 14.09-factory-proposed
14.04 trusty .
hmm . so the tests will be broken between these ? perhaps we should merge ( and review ) into
i can prepare a landing silo and get all the tests done for 4th of january
it was broken already
can you run `juju status -- debug` ?
np !
how can i update it ? i keep system updated
i ca n't see why it would work if i set it as the only screen then .
yes
missed the router part , thought he was looking for host-to-host networking
which manual do you use ?
i restarted my computer . does that not suffice ?
the canonical cve tracker .
latest bios i take it ?
i tried it against the openstack provider and got failures=5 , errors=2 and i do n't believe they 're related
i know
reason is my doings
without libpython that 's just 200k ( the cost of not having it in the platform )
was there ever another build of network-manager-qt against nm 1.0.0 ?
it should be transpart=ent to the user anyway .
it says /media1 ?
the compiler is probably relying on a config file rather than the local environment .
you also need ot remove them from the ci repos now ...
and mixing versions can provoke unexpected / untested issues
it may well have not caused an issue , i have n't checked , but generally , turning off proposed
permissions most likely . `` ls -al '' in the path they 're in
or do n't ask how to paste .
ready for publish : )
display=:0 startkde
`` sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ''
ah !
does your card not drive 3 ?
i did n't check your pastebin yet .
i guess we both love plasma so much that we 're willing to put up with occasional major breakage like
if you login normally do you get a desktop , is this a ssh always ?
take your time
welcome back buddy !
you may try removing them from the gui under system settings - > software & updates - > other software
nope . just verify against the hashsum
hmm , and why not 27 , it looks the same in bileto ?
too late : p
then use apt-get remove
try adding `` drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=edid/1280x1024 '' to your kernel parameters
to answer your question , the fix is there already
then it 's even more worth your time trying this out
yes i dont start
i got a badge and everything !
yup . not very good often .
and the windows vm does get full 1gbit in speedtest ?
yup that 's about it , you can type insmod part_gpt and insmod ext2 and insmod linux before , but
but it asks me for the password , can i automate that as well ?
oh ! i 'm testing on v+ , are you on wily ?
hah ! the cat command i thouth you were talking about a cat animal lol
how can we print the error ? i added gcc -v , but no output on is printed .
then backup everything you need .
yeah it matters depending on which way around you want the install to happen
windows only - and also questionable activity that i do n't think this network can candone or support
you are usign factory charger ?
can i get a full console output of everything from update to failure , rather than snippets from different days
having two files opens the question , which is the correct ( and future proof ) name
ah
yeah , the same way you install it on a disk
yes
you should select ubuntu to boot into ubuntu , then you 'll have to mess with the efi files
ack , let look at doing a hand-off w/ thumper 's team given it is there start of day
even with that , ifconfig shows nothing
seriously ... the mir fix i tested out of the silo ... i just simple add-apt-repository and installed the package
are you still using the download that errors on the live check ?
this discussion is over . move on .
well , then you have no choice : )
do you have upgraded your system ?
ioria : am i good now ?
no no , i 'll do it
can you reach a tty after booting ? or have you been unable to install ?
k well i give up
but we ca n't reverse the logic at this stage
once the kernel hits that kind of issue all sorts of things can happen
did it work ?
so , yes it 's supported , for oem snaps
do my command and you will find your answer
you do not load balance two servers behind a ip , you have one dns-server on one ip and another
open terminal and trype this to read a file ( eg . your syslog ) cat /var/log/syslog
sorry , i 'm not using ubuntu right now . what eric^ said
yes
no afraid not , i 've never used docky . i use mate and just use multiple desktops if i
you know the '* * * * * ' trick right ?
/dev/sda3 looks like your /
did n't know you could do that
mount /data
i should know more in about half an hour
it 's just that the firewaller is n't getting a chance to start
but as soon as we are ready to migrate , you can turn off the alarm-specific eds hacks , and
yes ofc - but different people access information in different ways , i 'm happy to read a 600 page
yes
good to know
so in theory , exact same kvm environment as canonical ci
i usually do n't jump to the dev release for a while . if things happen to break badly ,
yep
the client authenticates just fine in the wizard .
yes .
no worries , just make sure that if you do n't have connectivity today , please poke cyphermox to fill
if only we would know *why* people do n't test : /
so you 've added a comment to the event page too ? ; )
i added a conflict on debian package control file
just while it was installing the cpu went mental as something else exploded lol
tis always morning on the t'interwebs
yep , got it
yes.. intel cpu with intel graphics card.. it 's total s**t.. i had the same problem on 12.04 and i
what particular version of ubuntu ?
what 's the latest testable image for unity 8 desktop ?
which does ?
oh , that looks much nicer than the default installation . can you put that bar at the bottom ?
what is the result from apt-cache policy firefox
tried repos ( 14.6 ) , tried 14.9 and newest 14.12
i 'm asking for the ban to be lifted as i violated it twice , once when you asked and
i 'm saying that providing a new version of an endpoint for one error message format is not worth it
how 's the ignore list ?
do n't know , but it works without issues with 3.19 so evidence still points to a problem with kernel
a few things , i 'm commenting now
do note that this might not work at all .
agreed .
which different command ?
because i forget to type the slash in /70 which is an irssi alias to go to window 70 (
he put out a pastbin . looks like x server got signal 10
ok , i can see where there could be differences . the direct `` dmraid -ay '' works as you
right , well the other firewall change was a cowboy , the rt is to make it permanent .
i also have multiple firefox profiles , which sometimes interferes with that , it seems
should be done
: ) i 'm sorry , i was n't clear . what i want you to post to the channel
well , there 's really no plan . i just wanted to know if it was possible on a linux
i was wondering if i installed 14.04.2 server edition and then tried to put the windowing system on it and
ok , i 'm ready to do that
huh ?
`` ubuntu 16.04 lts will be able to run snappy packages
what parameters are you actually adding now ?
if you are on a 15.04/plasma 5 system now can you see if its available in the repo ?
apps themselves are scattered all over the filesystem , linux has no `` program files '' like windows does .
np - i appreciate it can be unnerving because of the pitfalls , but the approach on that stackoverflow page
but it 's good to pin it down
are you still there ?
sudo cp /mnt/efi/ubuntu/shimx64.efi /mnt/efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi
okay , thats why i asked ; )
i 'll get coreycb to take a look ; i have a few things to sweep up before i have
okay : - )
but isnt correct , still : )
and my doing that wo n't cause the archive to blow up by deleting all the packages in it alrady
can you put the whole traceback in a pastebin ?
no , the file contains references to the renamed widgets ...
maximize a window , then click on minimize .. then click on icon .. then try to hover an icon
like a program you run on the command line , or what ?
yes i 'm slightly outta my eelement on # ubuntu to . is that what you meant ?
how-upgrades-work question
and again : if there are known security patches ubuntu will add them to ( backport them ) to the
ok. all of that is independent of the oss . when you can , you should always avoid software raid
you should check in /var/log/syslog and grep for lircd
ok
what did you install ?
can you also do : juju run -- unit keystone/1 'relation-ids identity-service '
i see the last people to touch that package were pitti and mdeslauries
yeah i know , thats why i said that
they have an entire image for rpi2
odd . oh well , merge-commit from master onto net-cli , then rebase net-cli on master works to clean things
maybe collating is n't the right thing to do though . if it may fail due to user input ,
if you 're referring to echo , then see `` man echo '' for the escape codes it recognises
so what is the correct way to start the de ?
why dont you just install the drivers from repos ?
tonigh , once this ** is fixed
i 'll fix the watch file shortly .
run `` sudo chmod 666 /path/to/file '' also please rename that file properly , don ; t use + sign
`` suggested '' best practice is 2 x ram for /swap
/topic
i will be back soon
there 's also one-liners that can clean it for you , let me see if i can find it
ok. well sounds like nobody is going to fix it for you right now
for the very clueless ( smoser ) explain a bit more ?
yw ! seems that you have an older version of the fsck support btw ( still the progress bar )
tmp.mount disabled , no /tmp mount in fstab
ok , got that one working now too
those packages remain the sam4
when i sent this command `` ubuntu-device-flash touch -- device arale -- channel ubuntu-touch/stable/meizu.en '' , i 've got this
yes , ubiquity ; )
makes you wonder what happened during btrfs development 8- )
this is interesting , since right now the store has only 0.7.46 : |
`` once '' it is stable , it is years old now , it reallly should be there by now
if you write your own debian/changelog the train will not touch it
do you have hints to debug uoa/e-d-s no working in xenial ?
so we 'll be shifting to having layouts available via click instead
so do i just add it if i do n't have one ?
shame on you , you have a week off and no excuse
you have a gpt table so , might you know why or what it is ?
really ? got a link ? non yt for us china users if possible .
any chance you have an email on this topci ?
in short i do n't like some stuff on networkmanager and i 'd like to have that fixed best way
sinzui : i 'll add that
all should be back up
i was hoping someone has recently gotten ubuntu on the x1/carbon/mac
and then build on top of this by introducing a job
right ; not much harm , just in case you wonder
are you typing it into a terminal , or via alt+f2 ?
you have no idea what you are talking about
he is safe , inside a wall climbing facility .
o/ : - (
we 're well aware that the autopkgtest for srus is less than perfect . : /
could you also please paste $ balooctl indexsize
even if i were running vivid as my host , i 'd still need a vm . i do n't
no , not necessarily
i 'll have some cookies and hot chocolate
it will go allright then : p
err , upstart depends : systemd-sysv ? that looks wrong : )
what 's the error ?
/etc/init/ contains all the system servicee config files for upstart
depends on how php-heavy your application is .
if a provider returns true for this then it must support all the new networking methods
is it also a os
ubuntu ships the 0.5 version officially . so if you want another version you will need a nother repo (
for now at least , so no longer blocked
no iot 's read the wiki on this .
themue : just return dependency.errmissing and it wo n't try again until its dependencies channge
right , same here . until it failed because it was copying a path too long .
and gaming on ubuntu gets pretty nice , check shadow of mordor on steam
how long has it been stuck ?
yes
sometimes folks simply merge an earlier branch forward , picking up multiple fixes
i didnt do anything to it i just kept on working with the machine , all of the suddend it
sure , sounds like your machine should be able to handle that
the trello bot
ohh ... i am sorry robru
no , please stay ; - )
sure , but it would be nice to make the default situation more secure
you ca n't , you 'll have to ship the library in your own package , and even when doing
no it should definitely be `` sudo lshw -c video ''
dont be , its enriching , most of my english is otherwise based on techincal words only
have you tried asking the snap publisher ?
gollum wiki ? ( or other wiki in a vcs ) ?

hi . have you seen elementary . it is an os based on ubuntu but not receiving the ubuntu updates
for 1.23 we should fix it properly , as william also suggested we should take advantage of nesting runners to

and i 'd agree with the crowd that having one hook for the source package and installing it to (
check your disk health and run memtest , all this faffing might be unnecessary
thx
well , our versions tracker shows that debian has it in experimental
really bizarre because the cleanup does n't delete that dir , no idea why it would error like that
and , they actually do.. its just empty for most , since , they dont provide *any* linux support
sure you can , experimenting yourself is the best way : p
got everything sorted ? : )

i used ubuntu 14.04 1 year ago on same laptop , and logged in ok

ok top-approved that one
and this ca n't be conditional ?
but the more usual reason for the argument is that packaging drifts over time to accomodate the rest of userspace/toolchain/etc

sennheiser rs175 wireless
yes , i will sure try that one .
locate the entry ( ies ) for the ports repo and correct the url . currently it appears it has

some random facebook person had posted something about running away from home , and a phone number ( which was
so 3 ntfs and 100gig unallocated ?
yeah , i only saw that in the new cloud-init code
this is way too complicated . just add a cron job to rsync prior to shutdown
that would imply we know why vbox is sad .
you mean mir-platform-graphics-mesa-kms6 ?
for newer hardware support
so you ca n't really validate it
it 's the same error msg / behaviour : mo3 file does n't play .
did n't know about that !
you mean the open source drivers . yes ubuntu ships them , if they exist or work for that exact
no they close early
nothing of what you are saying makes sense
as can be seen , you attached the service pack cd , not an install cd .
well , there 's no fixing it now , i guess .
hi man
what all is on the computer and in grub ?
ya , works as well . probably has been fixed

it looks like for the new branch placement of images is a bit off
this is what im wondering really
you have a better nock off ?
that is possible yes .

try making a new usb stick with ubuntu desktop or xubuntu
does it have any effect to have ntp with num_units=0 like in the openstack bundle ?

that might be a fix in there , but more importantly it should fix the useless login screen with 2+

nvm i found the link to the page , my bad
i verified that current vivid and systemd+systemd-logind from 218 are fail
is that notifyosd ?
how did you find an ip address to use for openssh ? did the console have any output , ever
i dunno that sounds odd , cause uefi vs bios is just the method that gets from the bios -
no it 's safe i tried it out first : d
the partition you change is also always at the end - so you should be good in all normal cases
new mp in , should have resolved all the bzr conflicts
i disagree ... qtc is availabe in ubuntu archive for very long time ... pushing the big green triangle with
there r millions of other advantages tho : )
not today , sorry
i find that tone problematic . one might infer from that since you 've made space available , anyone not
johnlea told me just to mimic unity7
is the package from the ubuntu repos
updates , upgrades , packages available .
we will stop the bzr repos at some point ( once the migration is fully done )
that 's possible . if you look at the raw json ( s/ # /v1/ in the url ) it
yeah .
well , we could fudge it for now by giving bugcontrol nomination approval perms , which effectively removes the step
on python3 setup.py install for the config part
i 'll see if i can work it in
i get the main menu from the usb 's grub .
exactly : )
i guess you can try clean the cache ( rm -f ~/.cache/plasma* ; rm -f ~/.cache/ksycoca* ; rm -f ~/.cache/*.kcache
oh . why ? if they 're using the same qml as before..
no stray gpt data ?
checking ... .
i 'll push my setup
and which forwards to a real mail server ?
same here ... very slow
so you ca n't repro ?
what did you ping me about ?
also page up and page down will probably scrollback this window in whatever irc client you are using .
yes
unfortunately i ca n't , last time i looked at it the failure was quite mysterious . like it was
i ca n't understand german but it seems like either source or destination can not be accessed properly .
i genuinely think it 's a big waste of time trying to use this file system .
the repositories dictate which version of a program is available through them .
lsb_release -a
i can confirm that too , i can see at least gedit.po in the export . langpack-o-matic can probably tell
value like colleciting my gps profile and then sending info about it via sms to some secret reciever ?
make sure to change it to other os instead of windows 8
( which should be fixed )
it 's ok , np
run lspci
i have seen that , before.. that half screen type oddness..
it 's merely a convenient abstraction
to paste it for you but i get a `` use netcat '' message
unit193 ^
ah i see . yeah , the screenshot is what i was going to suggest taking a look at
basically , see what the google/twitter/etc plug-ins are doing and roughly copy it , adjusting for whatever service you 're
have you ever seen that ?
looks to be same same .. i do not run ntwork-manager and mine is different , so another means to
i got your request to reroll kwin somehow so i 'll reroll that
now i 'm doing : cp -r /mnt/* /media/ubuntu/42027ae9027ae0f9/lars/lars1/ this should work right ?
alright , let 's try making it essential again and see if that blows up any of our carefully-orchestrated ubuntu/ubuntu-touch
it does n't come in w/ regular updates ? the 5 held back that 's mentioned ?
i 'm pretty busy saturday but should have time to review the outstanding branches on sunday
do more people report that error ?
are there logs ? where ?
can you push another rev please ?
i 'd have to ask jibel about that
e.g . if no constraints are set , set a constraint of instance-type ?
and now ... are you 15.10 ?
ah . ok so i will use the windows tool . ty
well , in that case look in /var/log/xorg.0.log and look for errors or warnings
this idea has legs
s/desktop-guide/user-docs/g , basically .
though you 're right that it 's weirdly inconsistent - compare poppassd and makepasswd
how should i edit that file ?
show us `` /etc/networkmanager/networkmanager.conf '' please
well , i might see what i can do next week . : )
so you planned on reaching out to the flavors teams . are you still ok with doing that ? it
could sru the apcache fixes
i just thought it will be almost stopping those pesky enemies : d
also plasma 5.4 is now available for 15.04 in the launchpad kubuntu backports , which you can add after installing
realised also that you will need an existing account with another phone also .
yup
the thing is , that code exists for over a year or so
your top commit is 1915 ?
?
ok , i take that is i do n't get that option , i should not install linux ?
that said , we should still clean up the old sources of course
i see the problem . : )
so , i add a *error field to params.space so we can return partial results
yep
sure
i 'm busy debugging a work issue , but give me about half an hour and we can chat a

yeah , it 's a whole different animal though , he was following this guide , longer version has more
thats one way of doing it , you do'nt have to use it
how do i review the one in github ?
what type of video card does this machine have ?
reviewed
hmm . not obvious to me , if it 's asking for an existing install .
we 'll want it verified when it goes into the kernel for the next cycle
there 's nothing planned for long press for the button for now
ah ok . i 'll try .
well , kalikiana did that 51 mins ago : d
no nm in vivid has a flaw that a password ca n't be blank
the `` file disk checking '' suggests a file-system integrity check is in operation , and should be allowed to

whats forage mean
that causet the display issues
i use thunar or whathaveyou
last time i tried ( before trying os-prober ) both did boot windows 7 but things might have changed
thats weird . well could it be related with the sound driver ?
everything is working now : ) webdm , xkcd-webserver , my own packages ...

not really outside of maas
are you booted in the live usb right now ?
it 's a slight lie , but it would do the trick without extra string and glue .
so doing that ?
the issue with nginx is that they ship a debian-specific index.html
yes
if only we knew somebody who could ask the launchpad guys what 's up with that
sgtm
yeah , still got a few issues with it
so the actual size information in a resize event is kinda useless
so , it 's hard to say without seeing the exact symptoms , but the bug/misfeature i run into all
may i ask what you 're trying to customize ?
heh
even though on the client there is no user `` pi ''

as you can see , it 's already outdated , which is a pain , but i really do n't

yea , will do something : )

how did you install the nvidia driver ?
are the 2 pcs the same make/model ? do they share common hardware chipsets ?
not off hand
out of interest what do you build armhf things on locally ?
it 's what apple pay and google wallet use , so you can pay from your phone
fair enough , just making sure you do n't expect it 's booting uefi when it 's not -- as
then , for < case1 > , let me think a bit
oh yes . that is probably why i did n't want them to use jenkins-slave : p
/lib/modules shouldnt matter in that case since youur issue is when mounting from the initrd
i log in or start guest and the only functionality is mouse movement
ahah , il est bon ? ; - )
this is ubuntu support . dating/socializing are in other channels .
someone might install a non-deb package , still using update-rc.d to register the init script
i removed all the 'force ' mentions in this new code to reimplement it correctly
exactly , it should use the same thing we 've been using for n years for this already : )

that makes no sense .

i do not get a dbus system file
damn
q is queue .
and xnox also told me the secret how to test it in text mode
ok cool
no , you should need them for this quick test
but you seem to be typing into this chat quite well
see the backlog , but about any test can fail like that ( randomly ) when used with silo 018
yes , so if current init method is system -- i check juju against it , then switch to upstart
what package do we provide for lamp ? or is it just a set of things to install , is
yes , the rest should be solvable bit by bit .
then i have an unrelated question , if you 've got a few seconds for patch review/opiniongiving : )

for checking the bug
anyhow , sorting out if functionality exists should be a non-issue , casper is n't the sort of tool one
did you refresh the reviewboard page ? : )
neat
on machine-0
it has to be related to ubuntu
yeah , no worries
it might be , i have n't paid that much attention .

reinstalling x will not fix your issue .
the command line utility might be too fast for apport
i had lunch with them on thursday last , incidently .
yeah it 's my work laptop .
wich one was your third driver ?
well , let 's see what 'sudo ls /boot ' looks like
but you can find those files while useing livecd and copy them on pendrive or smth
have insight on that ?
yes
what are you doing that generates those warnings ?
check the shadow of mordor trailer : p

love you really : ) hey dude i have a serious question for you , in your work what backend
it feels like there ought to be one link which was a good answer to peter-bittner 's question , and

speaking of which ... is there anyway to test it on the desktop ?
you can install grub to the mbr/etc . and make sure the config is good so ubuntu will boot
no it 's not
yep , thats why i wanted another option

good idea .

yeah , but it 's not there in xenial

actually ... how do passwords for machines work ?
maybe they 'll remove it in future ... but seems like they are committed to the property

i 'll ping you in the morning and let you know if it succeded
hi , i 'm testing silo 11 and i found some issues with apparmor
is there a general sense of what i can do to get dhcp to recognize the isp > ?
the problem is that the rule makes no sense and i would never intentionally try to scroll in a way

will check later than
no internet traffic is 100 % secure . the how is above my pay grade
no i meant the path to the .desktop file , like : dpkg -s /usr/share/xsessions/ubuntu.desktop ;
ah , wait , those are not adt tests !
that is for you to test
if there silo contains only mps , no manual sources , and no packaging changes
but only from the store , not from their phones ?
either the download was corrupted , or else the download was fine but transferring it to the usb corrupted it

i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
what is the exact command you 're running ? please pastebin its complete output . what problem are you having
yes
if you can reproduce that in a vm somehow , i 'd highly appreciate a bug report
raof promised to have a go at fixing mesa ( eventually ) as it also pulls in the x stack
ah ok but in the future , any idea when that 'll be ?
hmmm ? ux did n't work , ux did

underscore is illegal in debian package names because of reasons . so better if the command was `` lsb-release ''
why not ?
i 'm open to learn : )
got anything you need me to look at tonight ?
cool .
webmin is no longer supported in debian and ubuntu . it is not compatible with the way that ubuntu packages
there 's a pulseaudio module that can do loopback ; that might be what you need
i have installed pavucontrol

yeah i 'm just finishing up my lunch , will do in a second
yeah , i know it 's for a trusty sru
well , i 'm documenting a single disk partitioning for now . i 'll add another post if i figure
finally ! ! ! now we can sort things out : )
that happens fairly often to me too
yes , several things ; i put all in the pad
that 's just a case of tuning the oom parameters and limiting memory available to apps though , right ?
no , it 's a common problem - that 's why there is a wiki page
mind pointing me to the tests for the resampling ?
let it install the dependencies
and then a unit endpoint can get an address on any subnet available to the machine
with listspaces we can fetch the spaces and then fail to fetch the subnets for some of the spaces
it 's the driver manager
also his rules are legit , he passes through to the stock dh_auto_clean
ask away with detail on one line
audacious
o/
screw it ... i 'll just do a doc
to use an expert recipe that did the same thing as atomic .
thats a lts version right ?
`` sudo apt-get install openvpn ''

your one failed btw

hmmm , maybe .signed is ! = than the unsigned one
it 's a dell optiplex 760 for the record
i see , well ddebs with apport usually work fine , there is just an index/server issue there
or you simply booted from some live cd or usb ?
will do : )
pad.lv/1248116
and you need `` qtdeclarative5-qtcontacts-plugin ' installed
sorry this is pretty new for me : ) but i have multiple servers , that are using a package
rogpeppe : i presume you 're not still there ? conversations extended ...
ack
yes sure
so a further `` ubuntu-device-flash '' would n't always need net access ?
tnx !
can you give a quick explanation on what 's going on with those xenial branches ?
change the icon image to use image.preserveaspectcrop , rather than image.preserveaspectfit
arm 's nic are usually on the usb bus
no
that 's why
did you do that on the very latest image , or was it possibly out of date ?
'32-bit drivers ' of what ?
i can take a look . currently trying to land some other nm changes into wily . if i can
thats only for uploading _one_ backup : p
no . completely hidden from windows and linux . is an ntfs partition
what is the name of the repo you have set it to in software settings
usually is better purge than a simple remove
that is set , it get 's an ip back it says
i know 2.2 wasnt stable but 2.4 is suppose to work with it
just to be sure - you are on plasma5 ?
btw what you are describing is likely a window manager bug
has ubuntu on them
you can try xrandr -- auto also
i know how to set up bind - the problem is dnsmasq binds to 53/udp - prevents bind from starting
14.04 should be the actual version they should offer
now what ?
rhetorical question : d ...
and they should come rushing back ... soon
ask someone on a different internet connection to confirm it 's unreliable for them , too .
let me double check
: )
i do n't , but you asked me a question to which i do n't have the answer without reviewing
yeah i am pretty sure i was looking yesterday and tehre is a nice parsable output we cna use to
yup
my thinking , when i was considering assisting with the website , is that the kubuntu site really is n't
you have internet . you probably have a wired connection . you have to install linux to use the driver
i started reviewing the other one . i do n't understand why ioutil.tempfile is not used
did you apt update ? that sounds like it 's trying to install the old version
also , should we take a shot at making system-a and system-b smaller ?
you have several versions installed .
ty , should i have to propose it also against 1.21 and 1.22 ?
hmm , would habe been better to just add a system image task to the other bug
have you installed the packages in your emulator ?
dpkg -p libgcrypt11_1.5.0-5+deb7u3
currently working exclusively from the usb as far as i know . `` umount /dev/sda '' returns `` not mounted
we will do that soon
also , even setting static ip does not work ( can not ping *anything* )
my favorite architect ( who happened to repsond to me first )
likely the local address
well , after fixing kwin symbols , nothing exploded . others recompiled without problems .
note that i also need a vpn to access irc ...
start by calling it `` linux-africa '' then ; )
so it 's different from the regular ( old-school ) desktop notify-osd
you can download it but it is beta
and then try again
and then ?
i 'm obviously not a db guy : p
this is the conversation we were just having : )
have you seen the bug report ?
could you pastebin them ?
no that was intentical
i do n't think grub knows anything about nvidia drivers
maybe hplip ? there does n't seem to be an hpliptools in the repo

you might be able to install it when manually compiling , but those packages are not meant for 12.04
do you have hplip-gui ?
is there a nice way i can programatically query for the latest charm revisions ?
^
remove it , relogin and give us info if that was the problem
it 's a bit of a book i 'm afraid , but i tried to make it relevant
it may be that you have to do some of this editing in a terminal , i 'm not real
it 's not on any images , so sure .
it does n't
at least somebody 's trying to help : ) where did you leave off ?
yes
i believe cxdvty wants an even 50/50 split first , size wise
u can but u waste space with that various partitions
that bug is symptomatic of a class of problem that is bad and that juju has had trouble with in

/etc/sysctl.conf you mean ?

what 's the detail of the error ?
when we start the worker we have two dead addresses 0.1.2.4 and 0.1.2.6
we 're gon na have a bunch from utopic though , is that in utopic ?
cross compiling on my laptop : (
cool , now it shows as mobile
i also thing we should be aiming for functional test execution via autopkgtest as well
best ask someone more able with scripting than myself ; but , i am not real happy with this double

yeah , there was a simiilar issue before iirc , but i do n't remember the details right now without

i ca n't know for sure for what ! : - )
that 's exactly my problem . but yeah i 'm actually looking to move to trusty

meh , with the cost of todays hdd 's , who cares ; )
i agree it 's `` bad '' both ways
no worries . bill started the job .
it 's end of life = it 's dead jim = upgrade it
just for mute/unmute

i 'd appreciate if you have a look at bug 1439880 to see if my analysis is correct
same
ok , so i 'll probably start round 1 of bug reporting on it tomorrow .
haha , well , they do n't even use that . apparently it does n't work
restart them all

ok
does it make sense , can you open the link in your browser ?
gvfs should do that automatically
an id10-t error
but basically qmin instead of qmax , right ?
it seems i still need auth plain , because thunderbird uses auth plain and it works fine

the here process sometimes fails too.. dealing with that
yes , it did . kudos to cyphermox for that .
ok well , once you 're happy with the qtmir-gles rebuild , i ca n't promise that publishing will work
means ?
ok , it is doable , we are here when you are ready to proceed .
what was supposed to happen ? is the mac on wifi , then you used the spare ethernet port to
and i get an ssh banner on 22 .
try sudo pastebinit /var/log/lightdm/x-0.log
no such thing exists . you could set it in the overrides key of the xsettings g-s-d plugin
there 's not much to go wrong
what version of ubuntu
did you logout and log back in after adding subsonic ?
it 's possible , i accidentally deleted some silos recently , and then when i was restoring them i potentially
sure , you have to weigh if you want support here at least .
you use your phone number as your id to it
what does the file plasma-localerc in ~./config have ?
possibly , you know he is n't happy without bugs to tackle
this looks awesome
ahh crud , i have to fix some of the comments ... i went from one type to another and
one will normally pop out of our automation whenever there are new packages on the base image .
yes .
well , this is not totally critical
yeah , but people turn things off , or they ignore the `` update virus definitions ? '' dialog boxes
specifically ? `` cat /etc/issue '' or `` lsb_release -d ''
so your point does n't have any relevance then , if you 're using a different kernel to me
what version of ubuntu are you using ?
it is was missing the !
ok , i 've tried now with 3.13.0rc5
ah , yeah ... right ... i had saved a change , let me retry it
steal some free wifi ?
if i write a website i also dont need any chroots : ) i dont use c++
yeah it is correct ... but strange ...
and find a solution for your software ?
i can only assume the php bit was n't on his resume .

whazzup ?
were you able to setup your wpa enterprise already ?
k
the window manager is a client and starting the server is not its responsibility , it expects x server to

okay , just did apt update aand apt upgrade with the main server , no updates at all , i
no .
i have the necessary sim cards and phones here , but am short on time at the moment . should
if you have md5sum , it should be this : 4f783f3917ed4c663c9a983f4ee046fc
depends who you follow
that would be important to know , since it will help diagnosing the issue .
i mean to install grub on the os he uses primarily
can you get to single-user mode with nvidia drivers installed ? if so i have fixed some nvidia issues by
you 'd have to eventually anyway
lol what ?
stupid question but is this ppa going to be the bento group ?
just to be complete on the fsck question : we wo n't implement the question about `` your partition is
yes i do
you installed grub-legacy . do n't ever `` sudo apt-get install grub '' , the `` grub '' package gets

the release-upgrade failed , leaving some key config files in an in-between state
in the printer app is a test .
also note the very professional stock wordpress icon for the page
ahhh , no s. `` man systemd.unit ''
this is a preview widget , does n't know where it is
hm , not clear , is it ? i wonder if there 's still some kind of race with loop0p1
yeah i meant any other than which would grant sudo use really
run `` sudo smbpasswd -a < username > '' to create a password for smb usage , make it the
then , check for the swap device with `` cat /proc/swaps ''
well , super fast is ok , but i have patience , and i 'm cheap : - )

unetbootin is one tool you could try
google make chrome , so its ' issues ca n't be helped if you 're already up to date .
just feeling the ( not totally bad ) effects of jetlag
i believe the tarball does now exist
what distro are you actually talking about
but it did boot ok
have you any third party ppa-s added to software sources ?
yes i saw that
where can we get the `` correct '' kernel config ?
doesnt look like there is any webcam there . what about lspci ?
: )
its not a debate for # ubuntu
we 'll send 224 to the oem to pre-check all those strings . lets get a +1 from them before
did you file a bug for it ?
yeah , i have to do a lot of walking and sitting occasionally , and my laptop does n't have
ask your issue in the channel mate
it 's my mom
why bother to confuse a user when it 's only yourself that does n't follow the query , not them
that sounds rather unlikely .
i 'll add a note to that effect
oh ! emergency == initial ramdisk ?
well , he started to play it when there were only 4 levels
`` losetup /dev/loop1 -- offset $ ( echo 2048*512 | bc ) /dev/sda '' then `` blkid /dev/loop1 ''
right.. how about a 'installing my first silo ' : p
as daftykins says you could also use a set of wily kernel packages
check that it is there

yes .
exactly
yea , we 're sure of that every release but making them pass in your infrastructure is our new goal

if you do n't have access to the router to forward web traffic to the vm or whatever machine you

yep
can you confirm if it 's a recent regression or not ?
yes ! it `` did n't work '' because the process was n't finished
it *is* in the business of knowing when status-set has been called

also , type sudo grub-install -- recheck /dev/sda
context permission ; )
i had n-m in a weird state , see just before
i 'm around , so feel free to ask
there is a per boot option on computers to do this outside the bios
that would be why ; - )
ok , you got a shell ?
er , that header is a bit nasty
ok try a tail -f /var/log/syslog and tail -f /var/log/dmesg
it is sometimes like that ; - )
it does n't make sense , for me the failing test was clearly a tap from autopilot not resulting as
yes , that 's exactly what i have in mind
it 's working .
in your dash ( left upper corner ) you can type terminal
not as far as i 'm aware
1410363
i used to do it with win 7 ca n't ubuntu do it as well ?
right
did you install prime first ?
what ever 's easiest for you
ok i guess from your hostname that means california , so what does opening a terminal and running `` ping
yes , local mp3 in the phone through bluetooth .
vivid
even technical people . pick one.. have everyone install and configure fabric or use a web ui
well , that sort of answer my previons mpt2sas modules question : 4.2 has 20.00.00 module in it
yeah , i 've been thinking about that and have yet to usefully formulate a response , but part of
might be a 14.04.3 thing that corrupts realteks driver
they do open faster on average , but not all of them

type cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
depending on what you 're trying to achieve you could probably do it over the local wifi
where am i loosing you ? do you want that package installed ? and if so , why not from
i 'm saving it .
anyway , now that i get what your branch does , +1 . it looks correct to me .
understood
is it a totally virtual bt
anyway , i 'm merging mine with yours , so we merge both ?
we can do the train thing now if you want
yeah , my new linode is running arch , i 'm trying to migrate at least some things -- i
did you try to just reactivate the unity plugin in compiz ?
ok no problemo
ok that 's great
do we want plainbox tests for all the examples ?
brendand : according to robru in u-ci-eng , bugfixes can land as normal
the first thing i 'd do is on the server you 're pinging , run `` tcpdump -ni eth1 icmp

well , for merging i 'd just push my commits to trunk ( looks cleaner than merge imho )
yep , will do
fyi , it just exploded some more , ci is on it
ah , so if you meant , is chapter 4 done , then `` yes '' but chapter 5 is
no problem
when was the last time i was aleep at 3am ? !
ok you know the drill
that is a web page yes with an image , honestly not really giving the details needed , like the
yup tried toggling all actual mute/unmute buttons i could find
and if not , zsync to the rescue !
then type ls -l /mnt/bootmgr
but what you have there is nothing like what ubuntu installs

.5 worked on i386 ... so that 's good
katco : i generally use stub as a verb , to stub out an interface , which generally means ``
it will just fail the dependency check
the problem with your command is that now my esc is capslocking ...
sqlite is doing a superfluous chown
any idea ? ?
than you gain in btc .
and whats the output of `` sudo dhclient eth0 '' ?
yeah probably , can remember now : )

note that ucs install someone/something will just blithely overwrite any existing version of the component in the project , so
alt+tab ?
ah right
im sure there is , but , you are using xfce , correct ?
depends on how powerful hardware you have i suppose
can i just regenerate the locale in the container ?
oh , i 'm referring to the two bugs in our iteration backlog

output of what program ?
so the scope is already in ci , it 's jut not going through the train ( just autolanding )
yeah , i might get one of those . the other listing you posted were all international items with pretty
yep . since the install process switched to using uuids , this has generally gone without a problem
perhapse . i have disabled it and it works for me . but if you want i can guide you
does n't seem to be a bug for that - i 'll do one now - what to report against
should that list all alternatives ? even if apt deems them `` older '' ?
unity8 , camera_app , and webapp_container in particular - anything changed that might have affected this ?
i though i had in my list updated the bug url : ) mine got marked as duplicate
ahh cool where would i look to see how to use that ?
and you 're ready to publish ? ; - )
yes , i dropped the worker logic for finding the latest image and moved that into the setup script
because to me ! visible & & ! moving is the same as ! exposed
cool i 'll ping them across after dinner : - )
i would try to write you that in chinese but my ibus is not working : p
then it is fixable , and my above still applies .
how did you try to add the repo ?
well its a official ubuntu channel so we provide support for ubuntu stuff not a other distro : )
the whole reason these channels were renamed is because it 's wrong to think of this in terms of ``
if you want you can create one easily and then remove , sudo useradd -m bla , sudo userdel -r
but anyways , this ca n't land like this ... will drop that branch from the silo and rebuild it
there are some outstanding bugs related to ext4 , but mostly they are in the os probing side ( installation
do you have pastebinit ?
im running ubuntu on my pi
hockey fan ?
i meant directory below my /home dir . for example - /etc , /usr
ha , good . i was worried a bit there : - )
but $ juju_cookiefile can place them elsewhere
dumping a working and non working zone and comparing them might be interesting .
at the first tty , ( f1 ) does `` dmesg | tail '' give you anything that looks like
so we use something called `` grid units ''
check read error and seek error values ... .
the usual pattern is to export an alias to the struct in export_test.go
and do you hide yourself behind a vpn ?
no
click yes
it 's 3.13.11-ckt15
what do you propose i do ?
well , the signing will convert whatever you feed it to iso 8601 basic format
refer to my last 2 comments to you
you could force vesa for the installation
my problem is that i do not like cloud-init very much : )
could this happen : plug in external monitor : client gets displayconfigchange with output : *not* used . then after
just lots of things to learn ; before i was on mandriva with rpms , which i did n't use
i explained yesterday to afw that i have four machines , three ubuntu 3.13.0-52 with ext4 and one with centos

did you install guest additions or whatever ? it 's in the virtualbox documentation , i have n't done it

wicked trivial
yeah , no worries , i 'm going to start it now
these errors tend to sort themselves given time .
not yet .
that works - it always resets to the notworking one
how so ?
something from the 90s that collects dust on my shelf
there is no /var/patch

it used to be uk only , but apparently not anymore : )
you need newer unity-api
what is zenoss , where did you get it
there is a different chat room specifically for that ppa
so 223 exists , and is just the device tarball extra
that has fixed my virtualbox machine .
is the wifi channel on your router set to auto ?
do n't bring that attitude here .
i guess : ) ... i should be jumping from utopic - > vivid this week ... but yeah i
let me take a look in a minute

we do n't test the core image *very much*

mmm , get a chipset that 's compatible if you can
matter for what exactly
see how mine has sdb , and then sdb1 , and sdb2 ?
like watching paint dry
because /tmp has the sticky bit set , which then makes ownership of the files count .

if you could check the rdeps and see if anything was built against the broken version , that would be

ack , this does n't sound like that gross of a workaround then
similar scenario : deployed mysql -- bind shared-db @ internal , added a relation between mysql and wordpress ; now
yeah , and upstart expected for foo.conf to still exist when inotify handler fires for removal of foo.override .
we dont have automation for these custom tarballs , so i guess it 's always going to be out of
is it warning or an error ?
done
up to you
right , thats what i mean
no ; setting up classic mode would be eventually driven by snappy
fresh is the last resort then
there is a `` hd '' and an `` fhd '' model of the e5 , the ubuntu edition is
you can google both if them and compare your results
ok
bug # 1527544
what is the make/model of the pc , or the motherboard ?
126 ?
or simply install the full kernel image package and 'poach ' or symlink the modules required into the running kernel
you 're confusing different things
i know . : )
but ext got trim support which is even more important on ssds .
^ sorry
as stated in the patch , now fsck talks directly to systemd-fsckd
default is 24 hours
ok but let me install updates after installation ok ?
yes
ahh , i have to set it up at bios
ok , i suppose the pre-req has been merged so its not as important
21
can we take it in pm so i can keep all information ?
interesting , i will try to find out what happened
there was results , not of repairing , but of autoremoving ... that was it.. no `` healing ''
you can install one of the kubuntu-ci ppas ?
did we mount /boot ?
cool
i 'll do the extra buttons if you give me a headerbar patch
oh , you and your qualifications : d
it 's a preliminary repos for 15.10 ..it usually does n't contain a lot of new packages , just a
ok from a `` function test '' pov thats right
is that required though ? could you try making a connection without once ?
my point is that neither `` registered branches '' nor `` changed branches '' makes sense as a page title
it built for me .
np
in that case your system does n't really have the official support
not far.. i installed ntpd , but do n't know how to configure it to follow idt
i can run terminal with a transparent background if that 's what you mean ?
so i was hoping for some advice on how to further debug this .
did you already did a mass-retry ? i did n't this morning
there 's a complicated process to even get packages from debian upstream , as far as i understand .
then they get the uri handler signal and all is good
in general , ubuntu patches the security issues . it does not mean that the version number is increased
no , i never worked that out
no , before press 'try '
we ca n't really not ship 5.4 either , so there 's a balancing needed to be done at some
i 've built the rootfs minutes ago against devel-proposed ; how do i get the fix ?
so i can just /home/surgy/documents/scripts/huion580.sh ?
probably not ... ..but you could log a bug against it
enjoy ! and happy friday ; - )
and have this usb still bootable as ubuntu ?
still new to this . not on that ml . subscribing now .
what 's wrong with the diff ? i 'm just going to take infinity 's upload and sync it to
in the previous paste
yes
each time you register a mock in qtdbusmock , it registers a binary , and associated dbus stuff to look
when i boot into bios , it said uefi
thnx , just did . np
en effet : )
thats the notify system..
are you going to that bq phone premiere ?
currently i see only 5 proccesses
you should really contact the support and see what happened , its not normal for packages to get uninstalled
then type sudo parted -l | pastebinit
anyways , uos is ubuntu online summit . it 's an online conference and get together for everyone in the
because its a fact
yeah . us-west-1 mirror works
i doubt that fix it
it is reaally buggy .
it works on unity too ... .
ubuntu on arm , probably can be used , but android does n't use dpkg like ubuntu does and such
ok , will have to ask xavi ... it 's not my mr
i see . so the original intention has been to set the address to dead regardless of its life status
forget crystaldiskinfo . you can throw some dice , which will give better results .
yep , check in your log

does the display work properly on an external monitor , or is it just the keyboard/mouse switching on desktop mode
well you can run nautilus with gksu/gksudo to have it with root permissions ; but i suspect based on the

maybe you deleted something crucial ? did you backup windows on usb ?
how is it different from linuxmint or ubuntu distro . i am talking about linux puppy . why some of

no worries .
i 've seen some of these routers retain fragments of config in their nvram saved settings that are n't displayed

can you resolve 'google.com ' ?
thats your choice really mate , im a fan of 14.04 lts
hey ho
settings > session & startup > application autostart
ajust update and upgrade , or is that not an option for you ?
but i guess the better solution will be to just not require a zone for maas subnets ( they 're
no , we want it on every click chroot
before what ?
.pid is appended as well .
if a system is managed by landscape can it still have unattended-upgrades installed and set for security only ?
no - path ( typo of oath )
oh , you mean the standard snippets/rules to build *.mo from *.po and the like ? argh , yes :
type blkid | pastebinit
not obvious from reading the test why it should block
apt-cache policy thunderbird , to check your version
dpkg -s xserver-xorg-video-intel just check if its installed
right
yes , which is why you should use a p2p voip application such as tox that is not run by
xubuntu *is* ubuntu
do you have lxc installed ?
and what is this module ?
you save the bootinfo summary ?
btw i gave up on greybird-thick ( thick borders ) . it looks bad and would be greybird only anyway
done
there 's no snow in the compizconfig settings manager .
anything not going to the 10.10.10.0/24 subnet should be going over the vpn .
works , nice
ok i 've dropped all openstack packages from my branch - ok to go with that ?
we used to build it without and with , but i believe at some point mysql defaulted to it
dunno : )
topic next meeting
ouch !
did you use the windows-ssh-client equivalent of ssh -x ? if that alone does n't work , try it 's
doing
what rteturns ' dpkg -l libsm ' ?
or that .
augh
to sum things up for the review of smb 's upload request - do you want us to add such
is the fact that i 'm using lxde in the hard disk installation of any relevence whatsoever ? i figure

be sure to assign the bug to yourself on launchpad before starting to work on it since otherwise we might
if only it was that simple - when i looked it was really old and would need checking over
i just think they 're beautiful .
can you take care of that pls ? ; - )
it is dangerous , the risk of losing data due to system malfunction is high
however , i would still like to confirm the bug - maas 1.9 seems to work fine for me and
backup and clean install 14.04
right , cool
what ? no i asked what you 've tried ...
what 's 'stevens ' ?
teach live-build about smylinks for build hooks : p

i forgot to ask : do you see a /boot/kdump directory being an issue ?
no worries
whatever you prefer . you can set your client to do either
nah , not if it 's just application configs
do you still have access to the tablet ? i might ask you to test my backport branch once it

you need not troubleshoot this anymore , and cant

the hassle with building a .click is you have to bundle all the needed libraries into the click itself .
did you try changing options for the module as per the link i gave you earlier ?

ah , ... .that would be me
ah , col , i was just concerned you were informed is all .
it always is : d
what desktop environment have you installed ?
yeah , so 10 boots out of 10 without /tmp being mounted as tmpfs without after/conflicts
even with the main archive , i do n't see any linux-image-extra for .18
hopefully you still have them around
dnsmasq and resolvconf since 12.04 , yep
but landing has been happening today : d
done
no problem , i am sure its something simple and silly .
ltsp is like a thin client right ? i want each machine to have it 's own storage .
yeah i tried that , as laney said did n't work
purge any passwords it kept ( it shouldnt but check )
cat /var/log/cups/error_log | nc termbin.com 9999
now things have changed : ) try powering off , too
it could be , yeah , i managed to corrupt my file in a similar way with setenv `` ''
the -d connection is the reason why he wants to do this
it 's a compile-time setting , and /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf shows you the compile-time defaults , commented out
hah , yeah
i do n't get the first and last or your 3 last messages.. anyway , stupid question : you have
can i bug you for another mp review ?
one on each ( because both discrete gpu and integrated only offer one dvi port )
hm , one moment
that doesnt answer my question .
ive been looking to isolate my dns traffic to vpn as well
yeah , i know the udev persistent rules also had that issue , but that was fixed .
i already did it : )
how where you configuring the raid on them ?
ok , seems like some trainguard-sickness has struck us !
done
it says that it 's already mapped or mounted ?
can you access any ttys ?
i have to go out for lunch , if when you look at the pr you are happy with it
lol . will do .
you know it 's created with the paramsstateservinginfotostatestateservinginfofactory and can be simulated by the paramsstateservinginfotostatestateservinginfomock
then the bios settings are suspect . i 'd guess a legacy/uefi issue
i suppose they have a 3g connection in the train of some sort
definitely
that 's the risk when you play with too many toys : )
right , i 'll fix that next
hm , i see it in the logs but there is n't much to go on there
yes
ah , good : - )
this should be a separate , overhead card btw
right : )
hopefully i picked the right base revision : - )
it might be interesting to imgur that distortion to channel
like canonicak.com/alarmid ? =
yeah , also just noticed that i get erroneous text-selection in mousepad-gtk3 with my touchpad . really weird and only
did you install ubuntu with internet enabled and updates during setup ?
type lsblk
i have a slight suspicion that the worker thread is running in the gui thread .
yeah i saw something about that earlier
the cluster configuration has `` static ip range low value '' set to 172.16.0.4
docker create a docker0 bridge network
romania best internet
looks very good
if i remember right at the code i looked at it just calls the hook with the matching filename that
anyway , at the least there are some bugs on that list that may just need forward-porting
if you do n't have a device , i 'd recommend you try to at least get the x86 emulator
thumper : an upgrade from 1.18 to 1.23 blows up
yeah , hoping those will reduce anyway now that newcomers *should* be able to edit it again
no no ... but if there 's two changes back to back
then what `` good stuff '' can you not afford to lose ?
: p
and executing /bin/true will log you out straight away
fwiw i do n't like any of the above suggestions
usb2 or 3 ?
is it a default install , you 've not changed any of the config ?
it seems that the warnings you get during unit tests seem to be causing the ftbfs
yeah , my first thought outside vanilla who knows . ; o )
: p
dell xps13 developer edition : starts at $ 700
replaced ?
does it look good ?
yes , i 've added that , but not release yet . like i say , it `` works ''
ca n't reproduce here : /
i 'm looking at workflows now
the xorg.. one is the default one that you have to activate to use nouveau driver
that worked with no errors , but what is the default mount path ?
chgrp is for files
if the problem was persisting longer it might be due to not actually powering off but maybe hibernate/suspend instead of
might get answers in # ubuntu-offtopic
okay , standby
it is not on ubuntu now
our tests are run separately by buildbot , post-merge
landed that testcase fix now - you can tell the wife : p
put a `` sudo apt update & & sudo apt full-upgrade '' in the pastebin and show the link here
at any rate , pick that one up and maybe you 'll find they 're the same thing
alright .
yah , it 's lee-nucks .
do you have the `` mysql-client '' package installed ?
but have n't verified that yet
only for your official packages , not ppa
what 's the wifi card ?
it 's nice because you feel refreshed after a weekend away : )
i normally pull immediately
i am from sweden originally and do speak a bit french , a bit french
oh : ( i have issues with framebuffer and external monitors as well ! in my case , they are
well it merged
lsb_release -d will tell
do you just pipe it to that ?
saviq : yeah i get the clock+black screen here a lot : ( ( (
have a play with google.co.uk test your knowledge of mozart : )
it 's friggin insane
listning on 516 yes . udp . normal 514 yes . ok let try
just ask if something seems weird
that could work ; do n't know how much it will cost you though : )
well , my browser comes up with only a single tab every now and then , with the whole session
yes , it 's quite powerful , can express various things once the pieces are in place
ultimately we can skip the train altogether and just upload the package to proposed directly
no , its a bios system
id_path looks like pci-0000:00:04.0-virtio-pci-virtio2 and helps you to identify the specific device in udev rule
what are you writing the charm in ? use juju-log or echo or print ( ) to debug this .
yes , if it 's about packaging you should propose them in launchpad
has your external ip changed ?
also , there is a restart for updates every now and then anyway
it was quite a change for sru , so i 'm happy that it got through at all : )
argh , the ssh locale trap again ; updated bug 1423359 , will fix tomorrow
np 's it 's what i 'm here for : )
why not ... ?
ack - will do
yup , that is a race
soon should i wait for it or soon should i get a used mx4 ? : p
i cloned qt5 in my home , and ran make from there
you ca n't see the disks
it sounds like an interesting idea , i guess in a continent like africa that makes sense
yep , arch restrict that -nvidia package too .
on a desktop running vivid . i installed unity8-desktop-session-mir
we 're shipping wpa_supplicant already
most welcome
yeah exactly
hey
excuse me whilst i go and shoot myself ! it *should* be : `` dig +short iam.tj @ 127.0.1.1 ''
do n't expect preferred parking
by the way , mazal on freenode told me `` tell magespawn never mind , i found a typo in
i have not touched the network setting on the system - but i checked if it 's available to all

yeah , this is summary of a ( new ) opinion , some board members had .
try running the client from the command line
okay , whew , i could n't figure out anything else to do to it : - )
preferr beeps ?
the apt on this thing is a bit broken anyway - tends to fail randomly
yeah - really non-obvious
yes cli autocmpleats such command
tried different usb ports ?
running i guess
okay - yes . that 's actually why i chose to install 14.04 , for the stability , but now
that 's fine , we 're trying to identify the reports in the log that only apply to the touchpad
oh\
that 's weird , the .pc pacakge is still called ubuntugestures
grrr ! check if lightdm or the x server are running : `` ps -efly | egrep 'bin/ ( lightdm|x
and it is a map because the bool value has semantic meaning
i 've a branch that improves the fallback list of xcursor names quite a bit
good evening : )
go to your git tree
np
that was last week
what i 'm getting at is : why would anyone care if they previously could n't go `` -- to
i 'll file on lp anyway
ok
echo `` @ reboot root bla '' | sudo tee /etc/cron.d/bla
it 's probably on stderr , so 2 > foo
but the reason it fails is insufficient configuration , so it 's not a juju bug - at least not
logitech k720
i know ...
yeah : )
you 're using the upstream version/
grr . ok , then , officially over my head . sorry . ask again in channel ; someone more
i guess , i always update all the software i have installed
it works without sssd too
i got question : `` are you using the 3.13 kernel and 3.12 btrfs-progs ? '' so obviously ubuntu did
err , now that is a bit weird indeed
was that something you did by accident when we had the chroot ?
yeah indeed , sounds like it
next few hours ?
all good
it 's not theirs , they bought a license to a proprietary product
infinity : it 's apt-cacher intercepting and mangling the request
slick integration of systray panels
i feel like your ping lacks content .
at the end of the day , i am just trying to get my wireless network to connect when the
again : maybe , not tested that version .
have you seen this issue before ? it only happens on vivid .
yep it seems to be more permissive with changes in the source tree
otherwise as long as citrain tool does whatever it needs to do to make stuff work , i 'm fine
does it make sense to opt in ?
what sort of job do you have ?
yeah i was just asking if you guys knew about something similar , as it 's so frustrating
amd64
hopefully you 'll get it sorted : )
i already tried deleting all the configuration files , to no avail .
can you give me an example of another app that will only appear in software center by enabling the repository
i see that timo had two patches but looks like the second one is no longer needed .
interestning ... i will look it up and see .
instead xorg.conf.failsafe is present
right , just thinking about the common tool and how it currently works
that 's what i did to get `` myoutput ''
you mean physically ?
does bzr have a `` blame '' feature ?
abandon it
you should n't have to reinstall ... but it may be faster depending on how customized the system is already
aha and it worked , thats nice , i like that
ah , alright . yeah , if we 're referencing the bootstrap node , we have to use v3-style placement
am i fucked without internet , about the 4g modem
another option , for personal use , look at an application calling checkinstall .
what 's the log say ? it should tell you why the key was not accepted
neat , was n't aware of that .
thanx
that 's the only way right now
i do my homework before i come in here . : p
yes
well , i ca n't believe that -- there must be *something* to tell a process that it can connect
opening
dont you have an usb stick somewhere ?
it 's a default mountpoint
ok , just trying to figure the proper command-line really
it does n't auto connect . i have to go to the dropdown and then tell it to connect .
open a terminal
did you update the cache ?
( out of interest , what are the dependencies of your process workers ? )
there are *many* operating systems that support arm chips
twitter-trending , believe it fixes a crasher in today-scope . very very low-risk as well : d
i just realized that you wanted to see it
pastebin it mate : p

noted
well your password is in the shadow file not the passwd file and it 's a salted hash so good
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
good luck or just buy a cheap wireless usb stick with supported drivers for ubuntu realtek/ralink/atheros
show us what is - > sudo fdisk -lu , sudo parted -l < - in a pastebin . so

so , either the problem is fixed or a dialog is presented to force a reboot

the gnome-shell package was from a while ago , but some of the libs used by gnome-shell might have been
how did you upgrade ?
i can not create new folder .
i 'm wondering if it is simply the case that the monitor you have connected is not on the gpu
there are sftp servers for windows .
i will check this tool next week . i am happy to hear that finally we have something more stable
describe the issue for help
gon na guess someone was probing your machine , or a script went wild
how do you find if one is in progress ? my connection is not reliable so i often miss the

can you file a bug ?
i was trying to boot with own compiled kernel
there was btw a short discussion about compiling oxide in debian and i believe that media-hub and then the libandroid-properties-dev
maybe for now pull it out so that it does n't slow you down and you can try re-landing it
what is `` context permission '' ?
did you install charm-tools from pypi or source ?
i have an app for my new camera - can take a picture remotely from the camera - but it
kilos also driving us to help africa rise again : - )
then only read the developer documentation for the phone ?
yes
sorry sorry , i 'm not that skilled in snappy to help you there
wfm with sudo ( i get a root shell ) , but that 's not helpful to you . ;
what for ?
you still have a migration block , right ?
ok. yeah that was a weird situation where it could have been a sync but had n't yet been uploaded
i do n't either ; but why do you need shlibdeps in the first place ?
will let you get on with it for now . ping me if there is anything you want . i
ah , we have that .
show us a screenshot of what is the issue
we may have a fix coming for gps issues
i would go to # # windows and get their help on that than you will have both boots for
how do we deal with that ?
what type of raid
bumping github.com/juju/schema to version as in juju/juju works
it just broke when i switched to pure xfce session , not xubuntu session
yes , its a bit tricky my description should have been better , its a bit of a corner case
ack
davmor2 , we are not talking about iphones
as andol says this is the general case - there are occasional exceptions
also support spdy-sockets and modern tech like that . - also super easy to make a dual stack frontend ,
magic
yes and it got further by removing libnm-utils but still seems to fail , i '' m investigating
yes , but i prefer to make sure i am in the latest version at least . e.g . ,
you installed ubuntu to a usb ?
ok , seems to work reasonably well here and it has a good test suite too
the quick and wrong answer is that they should n't depend on things that 're going to away
no ; different chipsets/antenna combinations have different performance characteristics . there are some tunables to try to persuade the client
after you publish , check the packagelist artifact , it should have just one line per package in the ppa
actually t he joyent tests are passing there , looks like
i thought you had found something ?
i do n't think it should try blk_update_request on sr0
also , i 've seen you 've some dbus calls around ... two things :

there are a couple of branches that are waiting also , so maybe it 's better to include these as

are you trying to mkae a part fo the library with a .pc file ?

i can reboot and try gparted again . should i reboot now and try again ? evo
i probably will mail in on the discussion first
just to make sure i understand ... you 're working on a phone right ? oneplus one ?
but home users don ; t care about scp
gallery-app has a desktop mode , the current logic they use is
sadly , mac os x .
kvm .
^^
better file that bug like it says , looks like bzr itself is broken
but that 'll add ubuntu to the fuse group if that 's what you needed
you can use something like `` top '' to check what resources are being used and how
i made chroot_local_user=yes
stop pasting malware links !
it keeps on saying no such file or directory
sort of a problem ... the name of the tar file bears no relation to the name of the image
: (
that 's what jgdx is fixing
it tries to create a new database table but the table already exists and they apparently have n't heard of
still purging
that or you just lie : p
upgrade from what looks like a no longer support kernel 3.2.0-29 to a 3.13 . * or 3.16 . *
: ) indeed
if i put that into a .qml how can i launch it ?
hmm , appears to be hanging at the moment , let me check
understand
see bot 's msg
but are you sure the archive that was uploaded is valid , can it be extracted locally to a folder
ok
it is a bit exciting ( i agree ) . i 'm just lazy i guess . i 'd rather
they are useless
has the newest charm-tools been released ?
it needs some gtk patching
i 'm talking about using one of your externals
original chipset - intel based haswell
yeah , i was hoping maybe there 'd be a system log . but you know what ? i just
what happend ?
so it 's actually less of a departure from the current state , mostly adding a feature where clicking that
no problem : )
we only need the module names from the left column
press ctrl+w
tsup ... ..
and you are not listening to what people tell you .
silo should be ready now
there was a ufsutils package in debian ( this box is running debian squeeze , so very out of date
oh your removal fail could be down to not stopping the service beforehand ?
can i see that sudo command
yes i am fine with that .
i take it you 're new to linux and normally use windows ? drivers are n't the answer : )
i am not getting one thing then how linux browser getting my network properly
oh i found
press e over the ubuntu entry and add nomodeset to the line with linux vmlinuz ... quiet splash
how did you try to mount it again and what was the entire output you got ?
ok , gdb unable to figure out the trace
we do have a migration script which is something and in theory it is reversible too
there should n't be a default password .
i agree . we just need ( at minimum ) some stakeholders , if not people to do the work
if you alt tab do the windows move/change
1. not that you know of 2. not yet
still , writing a bunch of zeroes is wasteful
systemd-analyze and 'systemd-analyze blame ' ; )
you 've been suggested what to do without reinstalling .
ok , type ls -l /sys/firmware/efi
cli install , for example
no . i mean , when i get the grub timout counting down , if i press enter to boot
i never see them , and use hosts based blocking on my desktops and phones
nope .
keepalivetimeout is set when you create the socket
nope , i just checked
rootfs build ?
yah , i do n't have anything there right now . : p
guess kodi/xbmc are cool too if you have a media collection though and for other media streaming
you wo n't replace python 2.7 , you 'll just install python 3 alongside it .
waiting to see if other people have problems with the firmware
can you do 30 minutes ? clearly there was some stuff i just had n't encountered before and combining that
yeah.. just look at that 21mb dump
sure . i can do that . i suspect if you try this on the power8 system that you have
indeed , try to convert them . should be easy
so ...
hmmm !
yeah , i get that , but what was the real issue , permissions ?
ideally , all your libs will be parts in the future
best-effort leader-deposed execution once we 're outside the reported grace period seems sufficient
you think i 'll still see the increased performance i 'm seeing now ?
did you follow the npm instructions even if it did n't make sense ? and are you running npm from
ok , could you give the output of `` ls -l < file > '' ?
dget -x on launchpad , one sec , if you want the link
why do n't you ask your real question , this is not a polling channel
i mean like , a tool to help you look through your installed package list
the old version is deactivated , the new version is activated
yay ! no complaints from libgl now : )
check with dholbach , because somebody 's working on automating it
what duplication do you have in mind ? the prefix ?
but that 's fine , i can sync manually i just wanted to be sure of the process
we gon na gpg key signing ? !
sorry , i do n't understand
it queries the metadata service to figure out what todo
no worries
i followed your instructions , everything is mounted , please for the love of god dont leave me hanging now
good luck : ) ( oh - and try launching the editor with strace )
i do like this - nice and polymorphic , but alas..
that 's the debian ? i guess a raw package should be at git or so : )
so , as it 's a complex case , i propose to be more conservative than for others : i
i did what you told me
is it reasonable to expect lang in the juju context ?
yes
ubuntu will not increase the program versions on a lts . so there is no reason to not install the
crontab -l
i have question about multisim 3g selection
actions and the actions watcher do n't know about subordinates , so if you query actions on a unit it
one sec
you are the person working rtl stuff for uitk , right ?
or is this check for `` old binaries that do n't belong to the target 's source version '' ?
we did the first steps already of syncing media-hub and gstreamer versions across vivid and xenial , next comes the
that was i suppoused
so the issue is that charm.v6 exists at all on the ci server ?
i 'm all for updating the wiki . we seem to have a habit of documenting ancient history and underdocumenting
describe the problem .
nothing happens
yep , so it just creates it for you .
virtual machine perhaps
then i guess looking at the existing hooks and adapting them to your need is best
i want for an app to have access to /dev/ttyama0 straight after flashing
pastebin `` dpkg -l | grep virtualbox '' please .
correct
ps , i 'm going to need an ffe for glibc 2.22 , since i probably do n't have the
i do n't think it 's necessarily either ; probably psu related - is it old this machine ?
i would suggest to rm that file
i ca n't remember . the solar panels probably were the biggest expense . ca n't remember the wattage :
did you install an -autopilot package or run from source ?
i do n't see anything
are you in the installation right now or a live usb ?
have dmesg again ?
then you can subscribe to the same bug with `` this affects me too ''
pretty sure we do n't
ok - what is `` tools '' in this nomenclature - what kind of stability can be expected there -
there 's a terminal app why would you need ftp ; )
hm , that 's not what i asked for
second one : )
try another maybe , to see if that influence nvidia-settings
also , i do not think `` unable to get local issuer certificate '' is an error . i get
that guide does n't specify how to configure the sshd on the server to use certificates ; have you done
that 's the request from the one who owns the server
[ cryptodan @ alphacentari ~ ] $ curl 104.131.102.147
i see .
right , but i do n't think that 's how we 're using it ( and it 's executed on
who should be runnin gentoo ?
i 've been doing that for like 2 hours now ... . including after the update to v1.9
boot_image=/vmlinuz-3.16.0-57-generic root=/dev/mapper/kubuntu -- vg-root ro quiet splash vt.handoff=7
this does n't make sense , it 's effecting my work laptop and home desktop
hang on . is your goal to merge your merge before silo 16 gets published ?
it is not yet in master
doooeeeeet
neo31 let 's show our support ; )
it is fix in ubuntu-drivers-common ?
seriously i hate jenkins so much
shhhhh garage ; )
not necessarily . the analogue audio jacks are connected to the audio interface , which is separate from usb
ouch ...
please remove from the pad when the package moves to vivid ; please keep it as long as it 's
ok ; why is it not that simple ? : )
but currently the clear is not called directly in the test code , but by the uitk helper which enters
what was your oem snap name for rpi2 ?
ah , ok
depends on your client
# kde-devel would also be a good channel to ask .
did you have any ppas installed and enabled whilst you upgraded ?
so with adduser and shadow being patched for extrausers support in wily i was wondering if there is any benefit
from my pov , yes
software sources is a sub-component of the software centre , and provides a gui configuration tool for selecting the archive
ok , but what do i use that for ?
i have not used kde since 2.0. was an avid gnome2 user so still figuring stuff out
: )
im sure , you can file a bug for `` mugshot '' in this case.. or , it could also
separate directories could be nicer maintenance-wise
well i 'm not 100 % sure
any reason for it to be arch restricted anymore ? mir builds everywhere now .
are all these machines wireless or lan connected ?
adjust mixer level , is that the setting ?
yes
yes , and yes
if you are rebuilding the silo we 'll need qa approval again
could it be because my pl_pl.utf-8 locale was unavailable in my sid sbuild chroot ?
i put it manually , you can try reconfiguring now
could you paste the gprs file as it ends up ?
put a breackpoint on the place where self.about_page gets instantiated . that will tell you why it 's using pagecomponent
you have to enable the multiverse repos
yeah , leader-settings-changed will be one of the first hooks that executes
we do n't have to , it was asked
sure you do n't want an account ?
this card along with a bunch of others ( some of which already landed ) is our effort to cut
joke aside we do n't have anyone dedicated to xorg , robert_ancell is doing xmir and might know about things
do you want the command
type ls -l /etc/apt/sources.list.d
at our company we also do pair programming ( which some folks like to call extreme programming ) , which
; - )
looks great .
not dpkg-buildpackage
termbin.com/7mcq
: - )
just recently , steve was saying interviews would be soon-ish , but i see your point
indeed , they will be different only visually and yet affect the user 's perspective . i guess that does
+1
that makes sense
yes
where to find them ?
sorry , no i do n't
you can set the default with `` sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup ''
check # phablet
if i were n't inside state i could pass it in via agent config
so ... ides ?
you could remove the stable ppa
you need linux-image-generic* and it 's associated packages
sure
i 'd recommend installing mint
how to fix ?
no big deal as they 're trusty pkg so they would n't go very far
so if you do var assignprivateipaddress = func ( ... ) { .. } , then you can add var
something like that - but do we know what canonical does , besides ubuntu ? : )
cheers - what 's the idea behind this ? i do n't really understand what it 's for - telling
by `` not close to releasing today '' , i mean `` we 'll slip for a week , probably
so there may be more than one jujud running ?
wait a moment i will give you the links
this is a fresh install . no previous os . exclusive ubuntu
sudo lsblk will show no such thing
set it to regular releases , then : sudo do-release-upgrade
done
yeah its disabled in the makefile , seems to build just fine , so i am proposing to do a
yes perfectly
since you successfully installed it before , the installation package is fine .
the one i linked to you is the best option
also can you paste up the lsusb without the -v so we just get the short list

lp : ci-director does some of the emails
the only thing messed up about the situation is that _gtk_ is in the name of the property
all my keys are set to expire either never , or on 2016-02-23
is prolly right
how did you install grub ?
when dnsmasq starts , it starts cache dns forwarding
it 's just a default application selection , not tying anybody to anything
who is chairing the next meeting ? thought something was going to the mailing list , but have n't seen
so yes
after the meeting can we sync super quick on that ?
/usr/bin/mysqldump -u $ username -p $ password $ dbname | gzip > $ backupdir/ $ filename.sql.gz
but that 's probably a bug in my code : - )
ah np
modinfo : error : module pl2303 not found .
yes
what ?
see /names ; )
ok , change the exec=
i mean ifup-wait-all-auto.service has a timeout of 2 mins
ended up tweaking the tabview css , so we wo n't be able to use the bundled yui style .
hplip device status says communication error !
yep , will preserve whatever ownership and perms
and rephrase providerid 's doc comment to clarify it 's the nic id
im trying to copy my current line in irssi
i 'm aware of the icon update thing
open a terminal , run `` file /path/to/file.dvd ''
naturally
bug 1419623
oh , that 's not mediaplayer-app 's fault
oooo
^
did you read through the link somsip had the bot send you ?
so nothing could generate the packagelist while waiting ? maybe prepare + build ?
for my purposes , i 'd very much like it all to standardise on one error format that can return
ta
i have n't decided how bad it would be if i do n't follow the custom . people probably do
no worries , to much time spent debugging disk arrays in the past
um . dark magic , if you ask me . : - )
yes
if it 's not installed , you did n't read the page
try again
any idea
windows 'logical disk ' is nothing to do with linux lvm , its a similar term for something completely unrelated
salam
it 's nothing final , but there will be something that depends on whether a mouse is connected , most
no no , wo n't take that bait
log out - when you see the login screen , go down to the console with : < ctrl >
yes , it asked every time
if you did n't remove it , then it is installed . in your terminal is there a command 'pulseaudio
does the video on ubuntuonair.com show for you ?
i really appreciate the response ! we 're presently using tdbsam as a backend , but i 'd love to
: )
lordievader : cheers
but not via the internet ip , on any system
if radeon driver works good now , use that ?
it is working , no problem with the volume , but if i holt my mouse button while i move
maybe i solved
put the work services in a vm : )
are you on an image which is from rc-proposed ? or stable ?
bump === sync ?
# ubuntu-offtopic for that stuff
so you did replace the network card ? ( as in , you purchased a new one ) ?
waiting for compile ? ohh , the lock on pckg list right ?
let me search for it
way to keep notes..
i use no encrypted , keeps my internet stable : p
not to my knowledge
will the pure-python branch be merged soon ? the ci tests and stuff got cleaned up
`` sudo tcpdump -vvni eth0 '' might give you a clue if there are any ip packets on the link
and manual placement via -- to
so the system has always been 15.04 ?
age old crontab bug
your what turns off ?
easier to get it from the store
not on topic here
post-systemd > entirely ignored ; the debian package turns it into a symlink to /proc/mounts for legacy stuff that parses
it simply removes the applications binaries/libs , so if you reinstall it will pick up your data
there 's one error in the test suite on kvm , but not related to eth0 on first boot ``
enjoy .
any eta on the double cursor issue ?
15.04
good , you will do fine i would bet . ; )
on which component ?
yeah probably best to run sudo update-grub and see if it picks up windows
okay .
hence the suggestion to resolve it 's not a hardware issue before you look for something that is n't there
yes the interface returned !
yeah it has a list of linux os 's and then below that is the normal grub list
did you add the : armhf postfix ?
try a manual purge of vagrant and then reinstall the wily version
lovely
have you used downloadmanager ?
fyi , not that it matters much , but i do n't have access wo wendigo
what 's it supposed to do anyways
we build nightlys from trunk in two ppas
done . i see no changes . also if i go to the monitor resolution window
exploding mercury ?
a review of whether there 's any features in gtk that should be added to the qt side would be
+1
which link ?
stop trying to win this startx battle , you lose , more important , the user loses .
fwiw , if you 're interested : all the queueing actually happens on the unit agent -- when it wakes
no , sorry , was for you ; )
plasma5 , and it would be great if both together
in the command you gave me , what does `` fr '' , and `` -pv '' do ?
and even nexus 5 it says that bluetooth doesnt work and has power issues ... ..
yes back to default settings , with proper gui based interface
no sweat mate
my mom uses scp to copy pictures to me !
i have the merge done but there are ubuntu-specific installer integration bits that need forward-ported ( the skip handling )
half of europe has holidays tomorrow and on mon ..
don
yes . i am struggling to remain family friendly
first i 've heard of it ... want me to dig in ?
wubi is not a real install it installs into the windows system . so when it goes wrong ( and
i have some missing modules it seems
not that i know
sure . alright , so yes it should be xfpm . try ps aux | grep power
i do have backups i assume created with the ubuntu backup manager
ouch that 's not good , you should use some form of encryption if the data is sensitive , likely
i took a picture an di am waiting for dropbox ...
i have the toolkit
sure
it seams that the folder is somehow damaged . was thinking about `` : '' in a file name ,
i sent you the e-mail i got , that shows when the decline was sent
the wiki ?
the installer will grab newer packages if a network connection is present . i believe this is the case ,
see in : recovery mode , what 's in there
yeap
i just have to write something to kickstart wlan module .
nope
i do , but , what is your native language ? you can pm me here anytime..
the mir snap framework is n't on arm yet
yeah , but it only is on left of indicatorsmenu
i see , and how can i see what is broken there ?
so any will do ? just looking for something simple and not overly bloated .
that would be better , yes
let 's see the output of that command so we can be sure the mbr is correct
this is the way most linux distros install software which is quite different to the windows approach
nope
sergiusens : i have two concerns : 1 ) it will be seriously disturbing for app developers that they are
maybe you forgot to commit ?
i installed kubuntu-desktop ontop of ubuntu . my fonts are totally messed up though , anyone know how to fix
dqk_dir is a different dir
and i had a custom one , no worries now
lp : u-s-s
are you using a ppa for steam or did you download it from their website ?
yeah , checkbashisms reports nothing when i remove that
try to ping it from there
there is a timer that starts when new scope opens from temporary scope
they 'd both use a lot
thats what the first guide you showed me said
mount it and move files back and forth
no that was mean . he 's just ignorant of the facts . do n't worry about it . test
one of the kubuntu-automation scripts will put together the packaging from git with the tar from kde.org and put it
so if my bios speaks est is it even possible to make it utc ?
yes thats the current imnage i am running but i have some problems with certain packages like gstreamer
ken knows about this
yes
brub shell is a rescue tool
you can add things to the runlevel commands to run whatever you wish
also ' # ubuntu-gr ' .
well , i doubt /tmp/autopkgtest-reboot will work ?
sure can
just personal preference for me really
you can also check for the return value from start ( )
install samba , and create a share .
use recovery mode
yeah sounds good to me
if there is no software , there is nothing to file a bug against .
you 'd have to have the firewall open to that box , eg : it has to be on your
006
usually the latest installed kernel should be listed first in grubs menu .
that makes sense .
heh , i though i 'd highligth psivaa_ with cihelp : ) he was on the adb case with me
hmm is that where the code for this lives ? well
i hope for you it stops with the error saying there is data on the disk . else it 'll
there is -refactor
ken never liked sleep anyway
might it be that the dependencies got set , because kwin had ifdef qt 5.4 code ?
oh , indeed , it 's not there in the real debian/control . check .
?
so perhaps you should be a bit more specific about your problem , rather than asking hypotheticals
i am forwarding port 80 for my owncloud server
oh , have fun there ! i hope it changes your mind a bit ; - )
btw for the next release we should shrink writable to 10mb or so ... now that it can auto-grow
potentially
install lm-sensors and check temperature . 70 % sure it 's overheating
is it in 1h10m or 2h10m ?
what did you try , what outputs did you get , anything in the relevant logs that may be helpfull
well the df output is clearly wrong , so i will just copy the rest of the data there and
like : rename - > make distclean - > qmake - > mak
its reccomended to install fresh
what are you ultimately trying to accomplish
just great !
me owld mucka did you get the leaving managers job is that why you kept going on about it ?
then sudo apt-get update , sudo apt-get dist-upgrade , then sudo do-release-upgrade
still having the same mobile number ?
i bet qt is n't handling the new repeat then
is the software really bound to run on python 2.5 ? i mean - 2.7 is n't that big a
20mm
hes if you are on daily updates
but i thought you said nxagent had no dt_needed entry for libnx-xdamage ? that would imply that it *doesn't* need
tu pars quand en vacances ? fin de semaine ?
if you think we 're okay and can go on though ...
ah : )
yep
then it 's a lot quicker
yeah true , just confirmed closing is n't emitted on ctrl+c
sie in sectors or ( kmgtp ) ( default=16677727 )
rookie mistake : p
good to know that this part of output is *kind of* done , axw comment pending : d
nope , just name , endpoints , life , relation-count
ok - so i would fix this in windows
set ld_library_path ? nope
was it built with gcc-5 already ?
idk what u mean : d
what format is the drive in ?
did you see that . only three commands to make few changes to grub . do you think i might
weird
not a lp bug at least ; ) i just wanted to know if that is even possible to implement
then apply , that will move the swap partition all the way to the right
ca n't you just use the qtmultimedia audio component ?
ok
latest
i apologise then for my lack of clarity
to fix ? ... nope . as we 've been saying since you 've asked .
ok
oh , nvm , that 's 14 .
$ charm_dir/bin/charms.reactive get_states
that is too low
$ $ merge $ $ requested - i 'll look at your other branches again later if i get a
that ability almost ready to land , but in the mean-time the easiest would be to install the open store
if the tests were just reliable run either in parallel , or under lxc , could already massively speed up
looks fine , go ahead
yes
not a problem at all
that looks interesting
it should collect some additional files and give you the option to post them , and then give you a
works for me : -p
either had i untill i did some google searches and since it worked as i needed it when i type
you did `` sudo dpkg -- configure -a '' ? what happened then ?
but that 's not useful for , say , invoking ls commands
icbw , but i do n't think ubiquity updates and re-execs itself . i 'm not a ubiquity expert ,
ask the question
was it supposed to not be readable on desktop too ?
just tried it , not working , time out .
is there an eta or something ?
also , the vpn option with disconnect.me is 5 $ . just buy a vpn somewhere else and you are
silo just finished building , we 're testing it as we speak
is that it we are done with iso 's ?
dpkg
can you just paste your upstart script ?
no
on a linux box , as long as it is lvm , there should be no risk
^ that 's what snappy does
it did , as jdstrand already explained
ah ok
no , i 'm even more confused now
thats why i said setup a resource monitor
yo , silo stuck on glmark2 now
i remember i showed you the video a few days ago , today i have exact steps .
correct
what should i do ?
the volume levels for music/video and notifications and in call are all separate volume controls , i can only think
pong
the udev rule removal is a backport of a change already in wily ?
how you uninstall it ?
i have submitted `` port ubiquity to qt5 '' proposal for kde sok
yes
it 's not just that i 'm afraid : )
wrt the process , beuno promised me that oem and framework snaps would get auto aliased when getting approved into
you 're not answering questions or following instructions . difficult to help you ... .
so it needs someone to jump on it and confirm the fix
well , i 'm not involved in that silo and i do n't really scan all silos for build failures
yes
you have gnome-session ? ( which gnome-session ) ?
the reason i was trying to install phpmyadmin was to delete the old zoneminder database so i could try a
the source code for unity-scope-snappy ?
apt-get source $ package-name will get the source package you want though
btw , i wonder why we install pexpect by default
yes , wilco ; )
ah right , that also had an ages-old soname packaging fix
what is the output of 'sudo rfkill list ' ?
yeah , we visited most of the museum around it , and did as well a lot of walking in
which one ?
yeah thats what happened last time
ohh.. me stupi , i have forget the -0ubuntu1
is there any way to get a list of trusted ppa ?
ok . it 's much simpler than i thought then . sorry !
and what did you upgrade , 14.10 - > 15.04 ?
1-7 onwards starts to white screen at the end of the level , 1-10 is neigh on impossible to complete
another option could be to change the guest from using that lv as emulated device into virtio disk ( though
no
i said `` yeah probably not worth increasing the complexity then until we actually find out it 's a bottleneck
some users have problems with it , for me they work good
well to me it doesnt make sense to ask how to install an archlinux iso on an ubuntu os
yes , that 's fine but ulimit seems to be blocking me from making more than 1027
the ubuntu image of docker did n't come with python , so i do n't think i broke any system
yep
can you tell us what kind of sound it is ?
but as you wish .
install as usual
so you may be getting a beep now because i am including your nick in my reply
the console log-in prompt in corruptese : d
yeah , it 's lagging several days behind for some reason
ah good ; i intended to do a reportbug on it ( did n't know you were on the debian
fortunately the kernel makefile has a deb target
did you have one more thing you wanted to squeeze in , or just curious when you 'll see new
do you know who i should approach ?
ive seen 346 + nvidia-prime working good on some users
but it tages ages and that cdimage scripting has soooo many features
popey is the de facto interface to the core devs
but now i ca n't use my speakers even if i 'm not plugged to hdmi
okay then
and since a/b does n't work in rpi2 due to the bcm bootloader
how do i know ?
this is on a vps provider ( which supports ipv6 )
what 's the intended purpose of staging-upload ?
many of the unity7 developers are in us timezone although they should see your message later if they have 24/7
the apparmor stuff in upstart scripts was to prevent race conditions
the head property is used to indicate which page head it belongs to . i have had some failures when
png ok ?
it does it now and then . i ca n't tell how fast i scroll .
one more thing if you do n't mind : d since i have a dynamic ip , the only reliable
keep your web content in source control and use a post commit hook to publish to the server for example
these kernel build tests are completely pointless ( and take forever ) for kernel uploads themselves , but very necessary
sorry but that could mean _anything_ - so as i asked , please try ctrl+alt+f1 after boot to log in
20gb is good
this sounds like the `` garbage collect '' feature is broken for some reason
choose to install to /dev/sda
i realized afterwards you mentioned the dark background - which i mistook for the black overlay from the dialog
right before doing ssh -i ?
its lot of effort when im outside . plus i like to save alot of different ips
linux cant fight uefi . its the hardware manufacturer who go the microsoft way .
it 's a python script which implements the mock dbus interface , right ?
i should have explained , you 'll see in the current/ directory the current source `` package '' which is
you should use the man pages
more like stripped down and customize then customized .

are you sure the filesystem is in tact ?
all the way ?
for example this one : bzr : error : requested revision : 'latest ' does not exist in branch :

i had forgotten that notifywatcherc was the original that i used to create the notifyasserterc channel stuff
right , but there 's always the option of other driver interfaces to mir like android
this suggests you may have incompatible package versions installed from different repositories or os versions : [ 685.357 ] (
can i say your 'check for default route ' insight solved all the ugly/iffy problems in the branch ? hence
that is certainly not a `` pocket tool ''
better yet , read the documentation via terminal : man sox
ah my apologies
lol no
the rest of your changes are now in my refactoring
anything in ~/.xsession-errors
'unknown host ' means there is no dns resolution . can you ping it by ip address ? 'ping -c
nvidia 8xxx something
no problem , hope it works for ya
well , i try to know the whole stack ... also , if i dont write the apps i want
i dont know what ppa to remove to solve this broken package problem .
email sent . i 'm out before anyone else pings me . see you in austin .
dude ! i am not able to install anything : / must be some problem with the new kernel
yeah , you kinda dropped silo 35 on us ; )
actually maybe i did n't get your question . you mean how do you know that you have virtualbox installed
yes , the its-not-quite-federated data model is a significant limiter here
or i 'll watch it tomorrow that should be fine too
i have no friends
right now yes , but soon from both
oh , wait
the panel color was explicitly set to red/white , so ... but if you 're setting a dark color ,
you do n't really need one , it is really nice handling i found at least
i know .. but why ca n't i do this in desktop

can you give me some time..i am going for dinner and will be back in 30 mins
good , that is expected . but now check `` cat /proc/mounts '' do you see sda1 ?
yes i 'm aware ... ext4 would be fine , how do i release this ntfs raid array from the
or maybe i will ask
no you are n't ; )
my bike does n't work on water very well : p
it 's enough for me though
however you spell it
10 days work
aha : ) check ls -l in the directory
so you 're proposing a way for ops to see the `` testing health check '' for the release or
for your day job
how long has it been going ?
you mean , *on a pc* ; )
how to do that ?
it 's not a waste of time if you 're prepared for a struggle , but it 's definitely gon
i love you .
it will still be a compile time error if the name is the same but not the interface type
-- 204.45.82.194 ping statistics -- -
so right , no worries on jenkins
or at least i have had the image that we 're only talking about the music/collection player
no as we got talking about other thigns i do n't even remember what it was
do n't delete anything yet , did you run the sudo mv command ?
but on trusty lspci -nn saw the right chipset
feel free to ask and i 'll try to multitask : )
yes , it 's the standard for > 2tb devices
i have short talk about it today on # plasma and devs are aware of it
when the oom killer gets invoked , in numa node 0 , the largest page the kernel has available is
just trying to learn in general , i 'm not a core-dev so this is all new to me
although john said we will probably move to the one in the window title bar
i had a question since i probably did n't read the machine move announcement probably : trying to connect to
you happen to know the interface of /dev/initctl ? : d
can i not use something like -- log file.txt ?
i mean are they doing the exact same things ? i 'd say the one which has failed had an
well , you can always build the revision that is released on your system
elaborate
yes
that is standard behavior
anyway , the last time i checked they did , maybe they 've upgraded since
i am actually not even sure how that is supposed to be solved
+1
heh , just noticed that we pretty much ignore bad credentials
right
hey , no ... we 're using vivid versioning
this effect is not `` fading ''
sudo apt-get install libext6 : i386
i assume it should be against udev
i will do that for a few minutes , but tell me , why is n't hibernation an option while
also you 'll see that i responded to your query on the taskbar intro doc
recoverymode can be little quicker maybe , but sure clean install always reccomended
ok
okay , the syslog shows the mounting .
is n't it essentially the same as what we get with 2 trunks ?
is lxc-clone itself documented , in fact ?
sure , for later
: )
do n't get correct font size when logging in , sometimes
i 'm on utc+1/gmt time currently
right but you said you did n't have that path so nevermind
hm , maybe i 've filtere it out from log
no , touch is really built to be solid alone
almost sounds like you 're getting what i saw a week ago
judging by the error you posted above , that does n't seem a maas ' issue , that seems like
so if it returns 1 , then the script will automatically stop ?
yep , maybe installing that can fix ?
all of them nowadays are quetionable
great to know . details : )
there is your answer then
whereas the old tmpfile was /tmp/snaps/
it 's still seems unlikely to me . that reporter has provided no information on system details .
i might that ... i know 14.04.1 didnt work either during the install or after install
that 's why i 'm confused - there is no link to that ?
aww but i wanted to see the jub : )
well , filing a but report is normally a good way to ensure all the details are together in one
but it gets sent to whatever implements the server end of the debconf protocol ; cdebconf in the case of
so , if you do this , can you add the ports interface to the local interface ?
wily .
so maybe that 's a toplevel `` runqml '' symlink
one thing that comes to mind
do we have a target date/timeline for this as well ?
do you want me to do a draft page with it , i can reproduce it manually
you fortunate
hmmm . so is 25 ready to publish ? the dashboard says so ...
let 's see if it has the toshiba platform driver loaded : `` lsmod | grep toshiba ''
run `` sudo make uninstall ''
sure , will do . : )
ah , sorry . i thought you were .
its the reviewboard service in the juju-ci4 env
we should make sure storage state is passed into operations in the same way the other local state is
right , that 's `` get ''
meh - did that not need new flake8 + pep8 ?
yep
so , installdir = /oem - > type==oem ?
hard to say , first the most essential ones i suppose - so syslog and the output of autopilot (

`` yes ''
one issue you will have with debugging your backend is that you have it do it old style by inserting
or if you really stubborn to use 15.04 file a bug and dig deeper on the issue
the canonistack instance is unreachable and unrecoverable
so do you use network manager or not ?
server has no gui right
what kind of third-party programs do you use on 12.04 ?
nope , checked
shutdown runs through the init process
yes , just marking it as affecting snappy now . you guys can later mark it invalid or duplicate .
ok , fixed . sorry , i had misread your original inline comment . would you mind having another look
auth login is what the client sends , not the server
where do you see that commit ?
beowulf , the doc itself is not from snappy trunk , it 's one of the first doc uploaded with
no , see if its user : user or root : root
yeah
that kind of interactive chat can be achieved with the interactive notification drawer
you can check the owner first 'ls -l /media/ ... /home/eric
hm ?
but this doesnt work on new files created in there
what 's the output of this command ? ( ignore the $ , it just means we 're typing it
well.. ok
cat etc/issue | pastebinit
but what 's weird is that the file header exists multiple times too
cerainly looks as if it is looking in the wrong path
righto . letting apparmor in .
you run in root ever ?
you can use this channel for all ubuntu related questions , for more chitchat try # ubuntu-offtopic
hey , i did n't expect you to be up ... are you in austin ?
so you 'll have to configure that router so that it `` port forwards '' ports on the public ip
and that has a typo . ; )
11k lines
yes , and that 's a waste of money in my opinion .
man ufw
can you file a bug ?
yes
i have no file called `` lists '' in that directory . i have `` cdrom.list '' and `` cdrom.list~
do you know how to use a text editor with root privileges ?
start with webbrowser-app
i thought it was enough to have the dbus_session_address set properly but for some reason it was n't
at what point during boot do the .json files get converted to profiles ? : )
did you try a nomodeset to go fix ?
am getting to that point where i 'm very tempted
they were spamming us yesterday
the default will do . transmission iirc
you should really try one of those registry cleaners
see /names
ah , also , `go fmt` passes
right , but nobody would ever type that .

yep , that 's showen in windows explorer
shutdown -r now
all this is in a virtualbox
but good q : , i 'm just working on resizing the default vg ( shrinking it ) and move
bash or openssl are not unknown binaries
a prenew procedure is getting some archive admin review your silo after it passes qa
heh noted : )
true but you can still get an overall feel , i liked lxde pretty well , and xubuntu is ok
sudo ln -s jdk1.7.0_79/ jdk no error but pointer the same
ethernet
they 're used to transfer data from client to server
yeah , it should . guess what i dont ' have .
yeah , /me overzealous
stop typing your password in irc ; - )
not to run ajenti . ajenti syncs with the system accounts ...
yes
i do n't have a solution . this is why we 're talking about header bars every day ...
run swapon -s to see what 's actually in use
that might work , but will still require the build process to remove systemd-sysv when installing upstart , which it
you press and hold it usually or boot with it held down , can check the guide for specifics but
yeah
15.04 lts server ?
yeah .
yep , ty i did n't know about that flag
money !
ok , good to go
well it 's a 17.3 '' laptop
i 'd suggest more logging
even using sudo doesnt change anything
in the tests , we have 15000 ms as time
man man
what about the standing ffe ?
when you added it again , we can use ppa-purge to properly remove it
ah . no : ) edit your systemd service file
how do i do that ?
so , by the time it hits the print spool directory , it 's been converted into a format specific
it is done now
righto
that is correct , can use that connection , was wondering if sftp : //user @ domain.tld could go automatically
chkoun bech yakrah ?
modinfo : error : module pl2303 not found .
is pcm set to 100 , or lower in alsamixer
i mean when you search for terminal in the store scope on the phone
it will give you a pastebin url to share here
does the tab stay open ? just dead ?
mine goes to sleep in 15 seconds
yeah there 's no actual file conflict . it 'd be nice to clean up the old package though .
kay . i 'll be double-checking anyway , but saves a bunch of pain if it turns out to be
right , seems he 's on vac this week
the region is then trying to say okay from this node , where should we say to get the images
it 's probably a system settings touch issue
i 've been trying to verify `` blocked sim card keeps on asking for puk '' and found some issues
set a resolution on the hdmi port . the ddc is probably broken in the converter .
well , the other autopkgtests do that all the time
i used to be using oyranos for this , but their repos are like totally gone . i 'll poke
ah , heh . i installed a local copy of si 3.0 ; )
yes
when you changed it to 0ubuntu2 , did you change anything else outside debian ? as changes outside debian/ modify
so , as i said perhaps too succinctly , i 'd have to do more work to do this with
from the live boot usb ?
ahh that 's a bummer . : - ( any suggestions on how i can solve my current issue in
that 's what i 'm talking about
i do n't understand your question .
i see the same problem in 14.04
well , for what it 's worth i just tested 329 and it worked fine
i can probably reproduce it ; i have about 30 servers that all have the same issue .
the video will be available afterwards and there is th eetherpad
good morning !
froxlor even .
can i suggest putting it up into a team namespace for the moment ?
that sounds perfectly reasonable .
done
nail its tail to the desk : )
mine does have a micro usb port for power and a real usb port , an sd-cart reader as wel
the gtk theme does n't exactly match the new sdk 's theme though
any idea about when we 'll have a windows release for 1.21 to fix the issues eagles0513875 is having ?
haev you got any ref . guides for this ?
but will double check
it 's my normal work computer . all i did to it recently was remove `` quite splash '' from
thats changing the owner , and not adding your user to the www-data group .
does /home/ubuntu/readlinetest/parts/ginac/install/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ exist ?
cat file
the vivid build was fine and i have no idea what is causing the xenial failure .
this can explain why long running webdm instances can all of the sudden block too , so i 'll need
yes.. there is.. i am already on it and it has 20 users
did you move the device from another pc ?
i 'm using a ppa for intel drivers , should be newer than in trusty . perhaps i 'll have
m working and celebrating ; )
from lts to normal
i 'll just fix the series on the bug , plus i 'll have a review for you real soon
if you bought your device a few months back , there 's a high probability that it 's the imported
yep good job : )
probably . i will have to investigate .
by provisioning you mean installing the snappy image ?
use the 32 bit google earth package instead ?
so obviously the main report reads our page at where ?
alternatively , you could share your snap : )
ah , right . not yet . i 'll flash after lunch and give it a try .
i 'm happy to assist in any way i can . i 've never assisted with an election before this
mind trying to reproduce 1464054 ?
i wonder whether you should n't just use jujutesting.mgoserver.withoutv8
ping
syslog , dmesg
the problem is with the long list of files , right ?
i have 6 cores and 12 threads
under vmware
have you set your bios from ide to ahci ?
but those are newly build by the previous regime . a lot of infrastructure stuff going on here .
i 'm not actually looking for the box at the moment , i 'd like to land a change to
err , no , i ram pvmove . pvremove would fail for some lvm metadata reason .
it seems i was wrong , dst strikes again
okay , cool ; looks like i 've got a new side project then ; )
well , delete that folder ?
`` /etc/environment '' for system-level or alter the /usr/bin/editor
well in theory one day the ci airline will provide images built for every silo , and then you just
it is random too . during the boot down it may happen but also may not !
a sample polo shirt simon has from a vendor who wants to start selling xubuntu polos
are there instructions for enabling that , or is it just an add-apt-repository line ?
well , it indeed depends when we get oxide in , since image builds take a while too ... ok
typo maybe ? so 3 it is : )
ok , so this is where bzr is stupid , i 'll have to pull two mps from the list
^ works
hahahaha . if only mono had any support on server side linux , it might be really nice .
if all you need is to install grub , you can boot to a live media , and install grub
how old is that ?
i 'm going afk for some time , please let me know if you have any ideas what might be
oh , odd . ok then .
its -s for apt-get it looks like , yeh ? simulate
not particularly .
no prob
you should see no real difference
cheers , will have a look in a bit
sounds good
not for me . i do n't understand half of what you just typed .
oh yes encrypted drives for sure
the maas thing yeah
hmmm , i am irssing in a vt atm , lets see if i can browse there on my phone
in the source root ?
go version go1.2.1 linux/amd64
/home/nameofyouruser/.local/share/steam/steamapps/common/starbound/linux64/starbound : )
yes
i 'll ask cihelp to have a look , but i believe that is because otto is broken
i 've not needed to set such things up manually for eons so i 'm not much help
bzoltan : my testing looks promising so far , i had to hack click so that it adds the landing
it did in .2 on the macs with broadcom at least
so when it is released , it is just copied over from the doc
yeah that is not going to help with out the ports open and the usb theathered
the router firewall is disabled and it is set up to allow all traffic to everywhere , it changes nothing
sure , i 'll give it a shot
build is done ; i 'm doing a test build of all the example packages
ok , good that you 're available for my eternal qt pings too !
i 'll gather the juicy parts as usual to the xubuntu-gossip mailing list
its nearly the same way like you do it on windows . so dont just play the dumb one but
valgrind has some errors for it .
true , but im buying it to have large partitions , if i will have problem creating them , it
sweet dreams to her
yes
but you say that it may be empty even when addresses is not ?
eikon81g : no download needed ; rt2800usb is part of the linux kernel
we 're getting kid-in-a-can
to yours
copy that line , but replace the temp name with your new hostname
grrr ! little details like that do matter ! : )
then use apt-cache show < packagename > for info ont he package
sure
for sure there is a way to work on it out of that having steps to reproduce
beisner coreycb or ddellav might be able to help more
i didndt knew..
where can i see the build now ? : )
so you 're stuck at that step ?
dkms node is back
you see in the parted output , for sda its partition # 1 is `` efi system partition '' but
ah , the infamous i915
have you ensured all your sub-scripts return success too ?
for videos he 'd be better off downloading them and watching offline with that hardware
i dont know , i could type both english and persian with it
install and run a ssh demon and connect from the ssh . or use the keyboard on that machine
waves pink fluffy unicorn at zmoylan-pi
heh
to access google repo you cant use tor .
sorry it was not linked , that was in the other mr that mistakenly got landed for this fix
however , apps ca n't connect to it without framework-policy . if the service is to be confined , then
and gnome3 doesnt do compiz so cant use those settings to handle the screen edge
if they are vm 's , how much ram do they have ?
yeah you can
can you write what the 8 button property would look like ?
we strongly advise you to install ubuntu desktop : p
just after installing terminator , lxterminal just disappeared . poof ! !
oh wait weird . i did n't know we were using non-archive gcc
nah - disagree : ) but ah well , off topic here
maybe restart
yes on vivid
that was with -e amazon ?
it 's a local bind9 instance for local ips only on the system ( for the vms on the host
try to find secureboot and fastboot in bios , both should be disabled
python 2 is n't a compiler , why is it on that list ? : -p
and then i rebooted ?
?
i an getting an error in my vivid install but ill recreate the virtualenv just in case
that should n't stop people from testing anyway .
it is n't set in hardware
no chance of getting some usb wifi ?
did you do `sudo apt-get clean` ?
and i have n't seen om26er online since then
the unit agent does n't run a crw
lol ... citrain does things differently when it is doing doal landing : ) single vivid landing messed up the
that thing is far too complex imo
heyo
it 's helpers used but the sanity suite , which qa asked to merge in the upstream projects , for
duped to bug 1032823
yes , sorry , in skype 's audio settings
i dont think we can sort that again back to a clean 12.04 : /
what mobo brand is that ?
could you re-build again ? i suppose it might be something transient - if not , i 'll then dig
i was told that was the case , but confirming would be good
ok , if i ca n't solve it i will ask eleo
generally you were right the first time , trying in # xubuntu , it 's just night time so less
on the flip side , yaboot has never had a cve in the history of ever , so still low
install `` pastebinit '' then repeat with `` netstat -tuln | pastebinit '' if you 'd like some input .
most of the images there are from my run , not his .
but it 's all from the same source , so that does n't help bisection . : p
what you could try to get a proper driver on then , is to run `` sudo apt-get install nvidia-331
hmm , i see it 's generated at upload time
unset xdg_data_dirs make check
\o/
something must have happened to grub . well , now you have a fresh kernel and a fresh grub ;
also , i realise it 's cargo-cult from the previous iteration , but `` if status foo ; then thing
which one ?
while you are rewriting it , might be nice to make it use libclick rather than the click command line
yeah
its basically the same . its just that the `` new '' apt names it full-upgrade to make the users
that one should have come with a warning about not operating heavy machine due to drowsiness
anything else ? : )
but the listitems.header docs are gone : (
enjoy your tea : )
you can add it to run on boot
.deb 's do not need compiling .
no
big mistake i made two years ago .. and i have spent more than 160 hours on trying to fix
there appears to be a plugin for pidgin . google link for linux and you should have enough to at
nginx ok here
yeah there is ubuntu in italian but no one can help ...
your git foo might be better than mine : )
works - and apis are different things - am asking about the python api .
ok , i can see that
spent most of the day off irc dealing w/ an unnecessarily painful ubuntu reinstall
dig out your syslog and dmesg
ok , cool
because i couldnt open file explorer
this is now the third card out of 5 which stopped working since i started working with snappy in march
ah wait , it is
t1mp was waiting on your approval
non the less ... did i apply that setuid flag on the file mount wanted it to be applied correctly
feels like a settings bug no ?
is ubuntu-africa on github ?
i 'm looking at the 14.04 wine1.6 dependencies
do we have a list of things to talk about in our recording today ?
by that i mean , do n't type in the commands one by one , but read the paragraph above
maybe the easiest path is ogra 's
ok , so device tarball enables factory wipe , and custom tarball allows to reboot , wipe ( i suppose
bah
go ahead
you could widen the scope to qml in general and call it qcs ( qml component store )
hmm ok
btw do you have a windows machine around that you can try running juju unit tests on ?
add `` set -x '' to zz-busybox-initramfs
how do i do that
let me try removing it and checking
as i responded in the bug , it 's a different issue . but still an issue nonetheless
id be glad to confirm the behavior , as i am in 15.04 right now
temporary failure in resolving 'urls '
off the top of my head , systemd files are in /etc/systemd/ and then targets below that . that 's
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
apt-get install linux-cloud-tools-common
try the package `` xfwm4-themes ''
yup
yes , as i said , a 'hard link ' is just mutliple names pointing to a file
please do n't repeat yourself , it 's very irritating
anything in the discussion you saw you 'd like to work on now ?
moving the stuff around revealed the real error . my editor converted the tab to spaces in the makefile .
1t ssd ? ? ?
how ? just register a new series ?
where did you extract the tarball to ?
mhall119 , will be 5 min late
i know that seti @ home and folding @ home used client gpus for their projects .
i used ubuntu live usb to do it . i installed boot-repair in live mode . i ran it ,
i tried to be a packager for kubuntu myself
bq aquarius will launch ubuntu phone soon to europe
i 'll try that now
sorry , but deepin aint ' ubuntu and is not supported here . see deepin support
it is on ... i ca n't go look the core iso has no browser ... unit193 's site
i would n't say no
would be helpful to know what exactly so we can sru it asap
stop making new projects with new teams : -p
i 'm not sorry to say that you dont understand what `` free '' and `` unused '' means .
( i uploaded music app to the store earlier as a present ) : d
i wo n't be until the spacing is right
ok , i 'm doing a xubuntu install just to check
alt+f2 maybe be what you 're looking for , give it a shot
i tried it and does n't work
like tupperware parties ?
please change your request to a manual source ( drop the sync request ) and do a watch_only build .
ok , iam done
lsblk will tell you if and where it is mounted
it needs packaging ack
all right , running that command now - have to wait a bit for it to time out
the release candidate that is sitting there now that i thought would be a quick release turns out there is
and linux is gplv2 , so you wo n't get around that
aye , i imagine they use a significant amount of data too and some people may get a little peeved
are you running kubuntu ? either way ... my command did n't finish the job ... let 's try again
right , why i guess is `` without a compositor ''
yes please
ah ok . thought it 's created by the package linux headers
3.13.0-49 is the newest version ?
you just trying to text boot for grub ?
i was getting around to a question
this is my third attempt to install linux on this mac , and it always failed . no , i
sounds more low specs of your machine , what type of cpu and ram do you have ?
not yet .
now you know . the resize did n't work .
fair enough . i 'll file a bug if i gather further info .
it could be also 30s then
thats a description of your intention , but not a description of what you actually did .
oh ! interesting
could n't you just use debconf-get-selections to get the values and edit the netinstall preseed.cfg accordingly ?
no , i do n't think so . this is a modem
i tried subject and in the body in 3 forms !
from the repos
the idea always was to take whatever the store told you instead of what the package says
yeah eventually this will happen enough times we 'll be compelled to do something about it ...
no , we can do it in chroot too
he is hes just not in this channel i pinged him on mir
because you made it a sub-section of 'launchpad ' . : d
then you got lucky . some of them did go pretty fast , but far from all of them .
or compile it yourself .
when i click restart it does just that . no prompt to remove the media .
sudo apt-get install pastebinit & & xrandr | pastebinit
you rock , tyvm
hey ! we talked about extensions to the connectivity-api some months ago , regarding wifi/bluetooth/cellular scanning and stuff like that
i 've commented for liuxg to create a second one , and i 've marked this one as released .
that would n't surprise me if that 's the case , we have n't exactly done extensive testing with it
fosflu apparently
booting to live session from dvd on real hardware and selecting shutdown work correctly . i got the `` press
now it 's `` only '' all that organizational stuff as well as looking/waiting for a new one
thatd be interesting , i will brag to my project manager about the successful passwd injection and will look into
and when i bootstrap i get a bootstrap failure
whereas 0.35.2-1 is the version number of the debian package , comprised of the upstream version and the debian version
yeah but 15.04 and 15.10 have both remarkable more acpi errors then trusty
no , not netboot . it 'll fix bug 1508075 and maybe bug 1436861 if it 's uploaded on time
yeah , actually , you are right ...
i suppose , but i 've always thought of mirbufferpackage as more of the mesa-analogue to anativewindowbuffer
ok the placement directive is
yeah it does indeed .
yw !
# ubuntu+1 might be of more help
pypi , if it 's a bzr maintainer ... .. i would be speechless ; )
it is instance specific , you have to start it by typing : script < filetorecordto >
kadiro just installed pavucontrol ; seems to allow me to adjust volume and maintains audio output only in my headphones
i have rebooted several times
is there a cve ?
lol guess it 's a reminder for both of us then ( x
use that
are you sure that uts_ubuntu_release_abi is available in the lts-vivid kernel ?
depends on resources
its not a game ! it looks like a game cause description is similar that is why
until what ?
try what cfhowlett suggest please
be careful with the instructions ... not all clear
yeah sorry
you been to the uefi wiki ?
i like to look what is possible . i like to install some ubuntu touch if it supports amd64 desktops
the # # networking guys can help also perhaps , or ask your specific issue in this channel
so boot up the live-ubuntu system and provide the info in here so we can have a look on what
i reran cat /proc/net/dev
so in this case i *don't* think that 's possible
he probably is after *something* , it 's just that his tech-abilities confused him ; )
lspci will list your hardware , take a look at the vga line
official is what is in the regular ubuntu repos , not the ppa
crashing ?
something kinda windows chkdsk but it should work under ubuntu :3 could you advise me one please ?
waht is sap ?
what git patches are you thinking of specifically ?
anastasiamac : with the way it 's the feature is structured it would n't be too hard to generate a
lol
even if everything responds super-fast
only manually tested ; i can do some more live testing than more than hello-world
and there 's nothing there
you 'll get the something-is-wrong notifications direct to the dying chan
that link i posted has the information you need . in your charms bar type po bu in the search
ok , try booting without quiet splash in the kernel line
ok , i though it would be , but i was unsure if that was due to the dbus mediation
using automated tools thats perfectly viable , because you can deploy a customized .profile upon installation .
show me your plugin
no polls here please
yes
there 's fsck.msdos there which might show something
ok , then landscape will look for that hardware information from maas , in the `` discovered details ''
e.g . sudo sed -i 's/compiz ; // ' /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/ubuntu.session
also fentimans dandilion and burdock
then ' sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab_backup ' ( being safe )
rebooting , lets see ... .
nah , but i know that snappy has no separate packages and no maintainer scripts ... upgrading package by package
and few other
i noticed that when implementing a workaround for bug # 1480404
that may change in the future , but for now the easiest solution would probably be to upgrade
since last year ? probably november
if you dont have the root password i meant ... i have no possible solution idea so reinstall
yep , lgtm
oh , and happily , it does n't matter , since the abi broke anyway for the c++ transition .
they 're mostly messy from factory installs , doing one yourself will reduce it to a more sane 2 or
what is the denial ?
i am going to take my aui adapter and 10base-5 network and leave this facility..
you can set your own dir in options
you can not change the 32bit to 64 bit any other way
veebers : i 'm disturbed by the deletion of the docstring in that mp
when vivid releases , i 'd like to be able to say `` i can now get an app ready
cool
just the issue on one line would be good
it was a last ditch effort . i 've tried everything i could think of or read on the forums
that 's a good point
there isnt a ap test for it . this is also why the qml test are also run by jenkins
i was just asking because if you were binding qt or glib anyway , it might make more sense to
kay . probably in a couple of hours , depending on lubuntu .
what graphics card is in that desktop ?
what part is n't clear ? the train will only allow uploads from proper uploaders .
shut up
ah !
nope , not on the gui
it is on the same place as used to be
hrmm , so my initial reaction is do n't do that : )
its a fairly complex thing to do - this is why ubuntu should just have the latest package as an
im attempting to use chrubuntu script to boot from usb + seemed my firmware wasnt in dev mode even though
idk , try to purge indicator-cpufreq and linux-tools-common ... if it works , reinstall them
sorry , miss-tabbed
i 'll get back to you once i hear from victor
i get what you 're saying , and your terminology is fine , i 'm just trying to understand precisely
in the web interface there 's also `` progression plans ''
give us a link please
ubuntu touch is just another one in the still-standing boot hoping for a fresh breeeze to push them forward :
?
if you have a patch to fix those bugs and have you got troubles with packaging , let me know
did larsu fix the icons issue as well now ?
had a good w.e ?
could you put the full traceback into a paste , i.e . paste.ubuntu.com ?
a server usually does n't need power save modes , etc .
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
the size of / , /home/ boot etc
i do n't see kubuntu in the khelpcenter at all
no one is proposing doing that : )
no . pstree does n't show celeryd
for some reason it works over root .
but what is the alias for ?
yes ... we hope to improve that in the immediate future : d
please do n't ask to ask a question , simply ask the question ( all on one line and in
yes
it 's easier to not fix it !
mm.. perhaps indeed , but did n't we fix it ? it 's been so spread out over so much
i usually start worrying about adt around a week after the series opened : )
send emails with the updates befpre
lenovo g500
but for demo , just need proof that it works
but you probably are going to need two versions to keep s3 working at the same time as fixing this
cheers
helps prevent ifddling in devel from messing up versioning in the main ckt ppa , which makes bjf 's life
now i 'm getting 'signing key fingerprint does not exist ' errors
i just newed those binaries , should be available after the next publisher run
an ntp upgrade caused havoc last night , and we retried a lot of builds .
ive installed trusty on more then 70 boxes , they all working nicely
if symlinks do not work
i ended up at indicator-keyboard somehow
ok , but can i get some information ( like private-address ) of a loadbalancer in all hooks ? for
which file is it that configures the `` xubuntu '' session ?
no
i did n't touch it !
ah , i did n't realise you 'd already tried there , sorry !
i actually think l10n needs to change
yeah , that 's the impression i got , clearly there are more construct2 games than there are ubuntu games
i have pendrives , enough . just not on this location . do you know of another way to get
not easily or not at all ? ; )
aaaah , the missing puzzle piece
i just asked you to run the commands that someone connected in remotely would , so unless you reboot and
i was looking into a issue that rickspencer3 reported earlier about slow webdm.local resolving
it must 've already been installed then .
depends on what your aim is . but raid5 is a good option
exactly how i said ]
well , it definitely works for me using the ip and ubuntu @
support means ( besides the community support ) you can install programs already made working with ubuntu and you get
type sudo blkid | nc termbin.com
not easily , they all use uboot . so requires a rescue environment
just a few days back , stuart added the community channel where *anyone* can upload their component to the store
or you could try lsyncd ( also based on rsync ) if you want something more dynamic than once-daily
this is in a off-the-shelf wily install ?
i assume your not on 15.04 then ?
aha , it is running
beuno : another matter is the naming , is something which goes that far to provide own rootfs and snap
oh yeah sorry , i have a pounding headache
i ran them yesterday on wily and had 4 or 5 failures
alright
architectures and not 'architecture '
no
good idea
i removed and upgraded grub also
but the bindings definitely need updating as part of changecharmops
i would like to understand . i know my drive does n't unmount by itself .
thats normal
possibly it will be tomorrow to give a treatment..
it does n't even run by default , you have to explicitly enable and configure it
would you mind ? i ca n't make any promises as to priority , but at least then it 's
yep . i 'll let the unity dev review that

6gb , i5
me neither until i searched ; its so popular it would be unusual for there not to be a ppa
see ec2/ebs.go for inspiration if required
i 've added some precision on your bug , i 'm also cleaning the incorrect unity system settings upstream bug
crrep towards the corrext time with ntpd and accept it will take some time before they are both in sync
the output of my /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf has a seatdefaults there
what 's the upgrade story ?
second thing , you said that you filed a bug for the wizard in rtm , right ? could you
otherwise it tries them all until it finds one that works .
afaiu , yes , setup as per mirv instructions ; ) i.e . tq5-proper ppa
actually . i 'm wrong . what repo are the isolinux boot screen/theme in ?
but why ? is there a problem with specifying the fs
his is but with many demands
responded
+ updates , thats important to let ubuntu choose right grafix driver
yeahp , that seems like the safe approach for now . we can abuse wily userspace a bit , cross-referencing
it could be , but there 's not technical reason for it . i envisioned it being the same exe
give it a whirl , but i believe it does n't work
`` planned parenthood '' **
'identify '
devops people use it also , for like api stuff .
interesting , this did n't use to happen
the bootloader should recognize the arch partition
afaik that is the only blocker bug we had , correct ?
so now we have meta metadata : /
perrito666 : ah , there should be a test that checks that the step was run
please show a `` sudo apt-get update & & apt-cache policy ntfsprogs ''
all jenkins does is run pep8/pyflakes and then merge it for us : - ) ... sorry i confused you
nice1
that makes sense
sorry it was supposed to be cat
cheers : )
and behind a home router ? are you saying you ca n't reach websites ?
it 's not in there
it certainly work in our local provider tests .
yes , i would like to . know what day works for you ?
that 's perfect , and all i wanted to hear . in your previous screenshot from the vm ( if
thats odd for a clean install
depends on you chipset
just ask the channel , you may find it better to use a forum if you 're struggling to describe
exactly , trunk , i 'll create a branch and merge it
i dont have webbrowser on the other computer . but i have the pastebin installed what is the command again
: )
and what did you add exactly to get the file ?
we had to postpone everything to wednesday because of some last minute problems
how familiar are you with qt/qml programming ?
yes there is no option `` extract ... '' when i right click on archived file in dolphin
you might try passing -- desktop to pcmanfm when you launch it . ie pcmanfm -- desktop
this with mir-on-x ?
i have most of the changes on my local machine ... have n't run tests which will also need it
yes , that 's my impression , too . is there information about netrunner 's future ?
its horrid
basically more info is needed - logs
we 'll hold that thought for on sec : - )
i can remove that too , if you want
for server use best stay on lts
what ?
i tought it should be possible to force run a cronjob to test if it works correctly
and it stays at that ?
u-m is what processes them , unless there 's a similar kubuntu thing
e.g . running across multiple hosts ; snapshots
so on pcs , we use the cpu provided one , and on embedded systems there 's often one and
i 'll try reverting it now
are there several programs starting up on startup , like skype , steam , etc ?
so i 'd correct the uuid in /boot/grub/grub.cfg and then run update grub and that should fix the grub error
we have a bug for clearer download errors fwiw
you 're on the wrong day .
i 've asked for help to create a local way to test the stack , in a rt
no . it is vm
amd provided the driver that is in the repos
why should n't it be running now ?
`` only one '' , yeah
i wonder if bq noticed any regressions in the translations
do n't worry about it . : )
did you check that pinentry-gnome3 works under unity ? what does it look like ui wise ?
: p so used to it : p
type sudo update-grub
just the double xubuntu-core is n't .
are there any sessions you plan to have ?
sorry for my bad english..
it seems to only happen on vivid on launchpad builders . it does n't happen in my jenkins builds ,
but tbh that seems like it 'd be difficult to me
fine by me , we fixed the issue he raised ; - )
you seem to have messed with your file permissions : / ?
how do you change boot options for a usb ?
if the release-prompt is set to lts a do-release-upgrade is fine . the -d will just cause issues if its
how is unity8 on the desktop comming along ? does it play nice with unity7 ?
_or_ the bugs are well known and explotable
the odds the culprit is cron are very low
it would be best to ask davmor2 that , he 's in charge of silo testing while jibel is on
how long you been using linux ?
yeah but that shit does n't work , and it does n't have the latest drivers
`` sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get install pastebinit '' then `` lspci | pastebinit '' and link us
no you did n't , you just asked .
and it only happens on ci infrastructure ...
yeah , a regression in the promotion candidate
that answers my next question too : - )
i 'm using system-image-cli -- no-reboot on vivid .
yeah
its a amd video driver
ooh , good call
can you ssh into that machine ?
i just told you : hostapd
ok try grep controller.php /var/log/auth.log
will roll back the snapshot and test again becuase xorg-server did crash it seems .
and enable colors
ok.. here i go : )
can you help me identifying bug fixes ?
you can add that to *any* stock , official ubuntu flavor , such as main ubuntu
happy2help !
and yes , it should be the same everywhere
not on topic here
well there 's advanced mount options that seemingly do a bit of union-like options
is gparted installed ?
doing that one on its own , wanting to get the approved ones through first
busy as hell , but all it 's more than good : - ) what about you ?
do you have an ffe ?
i 'm guessing 1.5.13 became 1.6 ?
okay was n't sure , all our custom debs get signed correctly just using debuild so was n't sure about
the easy way out is an empty override_dh_auto_test : [ c
but has it ever produced a lib ?
doh ! possibly your auth . expired ? seems to happen a lot
you can also use newgrp or sg to change to a group in a shell without logging in again ,
well i 've named my virtual desktops accordingly , but selecting them based on text search ? do i have
right
is that with upstart or systemd ? with upstart you might have a /var/log/pm-suspend.log
what is the exact issue ?
sbin doesnt occur under opt/dang/dang
additional security ?
the warning part
still battling to get webkit2gtk into main
the ethernet cable should still work though , right ?
the root cause was a backwards-incompatible api change in juju
any idea what mbr ?
read this documentation !
cool . ty for sticking with this
my bad . i accidentally made it 4 mb , not 4 gb . let 's see if it can
do you know a link to verify ?
rude !
yes thereis given in gb now found it ! : )
it 's cross-site..
if you manually shutdown the virbr0 device in the debug shell , does shutdown resume normally then ?
omw
err well.. it 's just for the site admin of the installation
is the network 'up ' at that point ?
so for once , please provide your smb.conf
interesting . to me seems like and implicit conversion is more logical
yes please : )
if this also affects booting a live iso then that suggests the problem is in the hardware , not in
yeah , but other parts of charm.process are not type-dependent
wait until you hear about what i 'm breaking next ; )
good . i was thinking that the cli conformance tests should be unit tests , leaving just a few functional
not 1.23
yeah , you can delete 5gbs right out of /var/lib/jenkins/silos/ubuntu/landing-005/ubuntu
it 's ubuntu that is choosing to package the latest firefox and put it in main - even if the
the script is about battery state , when battery gets lower than 10 % , it informs me , but
can you test that the bug still exists if you create a new project ?
`` sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates ''
then english please ...
ah , do n't forget about my xfce4-settings patch for the mime editor
also you retried desktop-next on amd64 only ?
did you add the ppa manually to begin with ?
ack
you could embed methods that check known cryptographic hashes of the file ( s ) with live-generated hashes , and
install the package : linux-generic-lts-vivid
e.g . newentitywatcher , dockey , etc
they both sound foreign to me : p
according to that the system has no kernels installed at all
which commit was this ?
so /home/sanjiban/qt5/qtbase/bin/qmake
yes
yeah rounding up sitter emails and the gem script he gave me
sure , i 'm just missing to review the tests . i 'll do that after lunch .
its very unstable and a desaster to support when its gone wrong . and it got issues with recent windows
take your time
yep , x works fine ... full resolution ... but i dont want x : )
or do you know if anyone from kubuntu team is working on getting the gcc5 issues in all the kde
yea , i believe so .

i am sorry not meaning to but i needed to start over so i would not be so confused
you can catch me here if i 'm available to help
have you seen this error before
just joined but that sounds like a compiz or lib unity error .
32768 bytes
let me open a google doc for that
yes , i know what it means , but i also know it did n't go into any queue etc
just let me know when its ready and i will sponsor for you
yes . to that i asked if you were able to get options for all username , password , and
we try to stick to fully supported options by default
also means i ca n't do production rollouts ...
well , sorry it is being problemmatic , but glad to try and assist .
no systemd for phones until they switch to snappy
ah no , f1 is after grub , when ubuntu actually boots up
sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ;
so it 's for an additional ethernet adapter , not the main one ?
ah yes , right at the top : )
no me
right
tbh , i do n't see how that could possibly happen . all_states does n't modify anything at all ,
ah , ok ... and with that they still have an argb visual ?
+1 on that
i suggest *not* doing this casually.. its not trivial and folks actually pull salaries to `` harden '' or maintain
hmm , i have been looking at the generated-date : to confirm proposed-migration is running to completion , that seems
two versions skyoes and the ubuntu repo , which are you using ?
could be , it took a few months for the new pulseaudio to land
i like your proposal actually , but how do you estimate the work ?
no shell , home directory
cloud-image is about 400mb used deployed . 200mb compressed images .
take the lead
i 'm getting sick of explaining this to you
i 'd honestly just wait until it 's released ( in a few days )
excellent ! now the hardest part ( kidding : p )
yup
anything is an improvement over a blank page : )
you are in a area with 4g coverage ?
yep master too

so what can we do for now ?
that 's going to make casual contribution nearly impossible

the more branches the more effort and the more likelihood of getting things wrong between branches , in my experience

i suspect you 're getting offered an smplayer or package deps from some form of ppa that 's ruining things

ok
it will load the stuff needed from the internet after the minimal system is installed .

no , it is enabled , but some functions are disabled . sync , boot are enabled
wtf , now i can
hmm am i supposed to fix missing info in there ?
sure , just ping me later .
will do : )
any chance you automate creation of those histograms ? r is pretty helpful in doing that stuff
it 'll be an ubuntu box by the evd of tomorrow : d
sorry ! it 's in /var/lib/juju/containers
`` /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure : python3 is broken or not fully installed ''
let me try the field in debian/control
i have to have kde installed to use dolphin , cause nautilus breaks a dual-monitor setup
yes , confirming `` x-canonical-activation-url '' is the x-prop to use
upstream release now .
the machine is from 2011 i believe
i did suggest that , but i was advised to send to germany
well , if you 're using lxc/chroot , then it 's easy enough to have stuff already installed
pebkac
im installing arch
hmm , my arale just locked up hard ... doesnt take inout
that rule is actually terribly problematic , but that is another story
so you 're on wily ?
which dd command ?
it 's more straightforward to have the bootloader for each os on the same disk
the messaging menu status
then focus on installing first . come back when you have issues or new questions .
see link
sudo service networking restart
you 've come here long enough to know that language is not appropriate .
if we 're not recording dpkg and apt version in all upgrade reports , that 's a massive bug .
the /media/nas folder is a folder i made myself . my nas exports 4 shares . files , videos ,
sinzui , actually the tests are bad , because with axw 's patch all tests now take the current machine
ack
the device isnt listed there
get 15.04 and test a live session .
snip it off ?
: (
i had it on my laptop already.. jessie + some bits of sid
im tired
hmm , but where is the user selection stored ? like when you log in to a different one ,
yes i see this now . how this became possible ?
when the installer creates the user account it sets the standard system password ( with passwd ) , it also
yea i kinnda know where you were from
ah ok , just knew you were working on `` stuff ''
donkarlo @ mohammad-desktop : ~ $ cat /etc/issue
i doubt it
why ?
i will fix the update to not cause problem with the sync-evolution sources
no , mainly testing
man lvcreate : )
context ?
can you use the images i made so i can see , cuz on my screen they are the old
i would n't know : - )
this all seems a bit sticky
i see . `` too many cooks '' : )
yes , there are a number of things to try that i found online , but none worked .
who knows
ref terminal
ok. can you boot from an ubuntu livecd/usb ?
would this make you feel more comfortable ?
doesnt matter . it hsa a broken disk .
depends on your system ; if you have high-end graphics card that will come issue .
cheers : )
: - ( fair enough , then
seems unity failed after i suggested killing /var/crash/*
ask steam about that . we cant tell you what their plans are
happy new year !
nm found the mp
if it is some slider , than it shoudl have optin to add text on images
i 've updated the bug report
no small thing , ubuntu 's always been about polish . glad to see flavours living up to that .
what ppa ?
how can this come from our patch then ?
do you think bug # 194257 could be a good start ? seems very trivial , but could be a
just do a ld_library_path to where they are built ?
few days back , there was a mail chain for creating test for ubuntu help app
or just lp : mir ?
?
slowly slowly catch yee monkey , and do n't over do it
i guess that is true for a `` system compositor ''
dont waste a thought about 13.04 , its dead already
okay , i 'll tell mazal on freenode
after the team call today work for you ?
whatprogram ?
actualy , paste the output of groups - lets be sure about this . can paste here as only one
this is confused somewhat in your case because the peer relation is *also* handling the follower case , so it
that should complete cleanly ( i.e . no output ) but shout if there was an error
sure , after it 's built ?
yeah . ls-ing the folder shows lots of libcairo files
yes , take a look at the fs type
well tbh i 'm happy you ca n't ... then you 'd probably do less of what you did now
how old is this hdd ?
the irc channel for touch may have interactive people in it
the issue is me . : )
yeah . rather : there is always only one instance running , as running multiple libreoffices isnt too good for
then i have no idea - does not sound good - sorry
on what isp ?
stop
let me look in to it
sorry : )
ah ok
this on a computer on the web ?
have you installed the nvidia drivers ?
can you file a bug against media-hub for that ?
i mean , did it ever work ?
btw i never got it working in chrome
how dis you install mono ?
afraid i dont use suspend so i dont know much about . inspect the usual logs etc with journalctl
the lxc based unit tests and vivid machine test do n't vote because they are n't reliable ...
oh on hols ? then go ahead with the merge
hm , trusty has 2.14 , utopic has 3.6 , vivid 3.9.3 ; so 3.0 is n't actually that easy
'startx ' is n't the way to start the desktop environment though , the display manager packages do that .
the delta update files ?
ty good to know
try sudo apt-get -y install lubuntu-artwork
black screen ?
a whole bunch of /dev/mapper/stuff and /dev/sda
at least , the start of one : )
yes
you 're supposed to use sudo do-release-upgrade to upgrade to a newer release
works in chromium too
'heads up ' this is not a windows channel but ubuntu support .
having a snap is probably easier since it 's no work
oops , sorry , was still a draft .. my fault
nolsen_ , my laptop does n't even see the usb flash . it goes right back to bios when i
it does n't seem like overkill to me
so start on starting rc runlevel= [ 2345 ] and task ?
alrighty . doing the -signed dance , should be ready after that .
i know , that 's because i had to re-propose the branch targetting /staging this time
will ubuntu auto import experimental packages ?
it makes the file always run as the owner
i 'll just cancel , it 's an on-air meeting and we 're already delayed
ok , passed on your email and irc nickname . hope they can help .
on the assumption that that 's true , one can now ucs install curated components . : )
no sweat mate : p
yep , the dutch wiki page is very helpfull
what did you find ?
any ideas how to get the gui back ?
yes , almost all the autopilot tests , i 'd prefer to use the fake sensors .
yes .
i do n't have webm on my phone , i 'm actually testing desktop , hence asking popey
spotted an unrelated issue wrt account-polld and individual message actions , but that 's nothing to do with this :
nothing .
in the audit.rules you need `` -f arch=b32 '' or similar
going it more difficult for very little gain .
does /var/log/dmesg give anything actionable ?
yes , : )
ttys .
yeah i fixed that a couple times already but somehow my fix does n't seem to be sticking . not
when ? ? ? ? ?
lol . sorry for jumping channels
see , tor already running
yes , indeed
thx , will do the mr asap
my pleasure !
yeah , all the api and apiserver stuff landed in a previous branch . this is just to add a
it is checksummed before installation , and installation went fine .
what config must be unseth ?
what about liberasurecode ? i have done work directly on that package to knock it into shape
if i run grub install on that partition , will that handle the mbr and making that drive bootable ?
the upstream bug report ends with `` can not reproduce '' which might suggest a debian/ubuntu problem
not used or referenced in any way by shell plugin
tx
^
@ is mean he is op , you can direct call his nick name .
do n't think i have used aconnect , i always use qjackctl to connect midi to synths
i.e . it was manually changed or via package upload
are you having issues loading it in your browser ?
yes it 's linux-generic and video driver from the repos
no worries at all
melon was asking about wifi ap : )
seems that way . i have rc-proposed downloading in the sdk , but i could n't actually get it to
so how did you add this ppa ?
he never showed up !
there exists nevernote , or , more precisely , nixnote
ok , well that flashed a whole new image , so first boot will take a bit longer than normal
yeah , can ping him again
ty !
oh yeah i do just mean the channel list on the left , tabs are just another way to represent
i have the fix for 1415176 shall i propose that to 1.24 ? or into master already ?
that 's the problem , it does n't .
who else do you know is trying to fix it ?
happy2help ! just for testing purposes , install a package to ensure you can
the autopkgtest state is n't in any way clean enough a baseline to gate migration on , only to inform
then this happened and i assumed it was the cause
ok , so it is just text .
uh ... .do you have one for vivid ?
no
yeah , boot into a usb stick and chroot into the installed partition
has an gnome encfs manager gui tool which is quite handy
i have been scratching my head for the same question , is it an upstream or a downstream one
there 's no *general* statement that particular workers must be bound to particular machines
the real reason i do that is i dislike playing with system files/folders unless i really have to .
please take it to # ubuntu-offtopic
if it boots then it 's ... go ahead , say it
got ascension day and father 's day here in germany today
is this a raspi v2 ?
it 's not . : p
yes , but companies vary
in that in ros1 you need all kinds of access and assumptions about the underlying system to do that .
no
it seems straightforward
sent everything i have
so i also tested the trunk version on rtm , and had a bunch of failures
i understood that launchpad uses bzr , but i may be wrong . if that 's the tool it uses
has the day off today
yes , all 42 partitions
2. something happen during the autoregistration process that prevented it from registering itself in maas , which would require me
^^ there yu got an expert : )
if you can `` pastebinit < ( df -h ) '' it 'd be easier
official repositories , no ppa enabled
maybe thats why you dont see the things that changed , from devel-proposed ?
yeah ... it 's a lot different than what i normally think of when someone says `` rpc '' .
something like that might be a good idea ( i suggested to move it to dh-python , but its maintainer
okay . so , the userspace tool should absolutely be native-endian , while the firmware should n't be . their
sounds good , also if you can , unit tests and / or integration tests
: )
technically no , but it should be , i 'll change that
exactly
enjoy !
hehe , ok
even a default symlink would be a useful interim measure
where does it say it is an oem snap ?
master is `` 00 '' showing full volume , headphone is `` mm ' empty volume
and ?
so people think it was scheduled on wednesday because that 's in the middle of the screen
if you look at the manpage for rmdir ( 2 ) , it states that the path can not end
check audio devices
but anyway , that just wo n't carry over to git world
which ubuntu are you on ? `` cat /etc/issue ''
apparently harald sitter uploaded it an hour ago .
installing linux-image-generic-lts-trusty
sounds right , is there any possibility to debug the profile ? because i would like to keep the profile
open source software
did you check if the bios flash has that known issue on dell ?
done , bug 1471770
for default output testing use `` speaker-test -dfront -l 2 -c 2 -t wav ``
ubuntu operates differently though , so ...
yes , we try to be nice to people : )
so basically because hardware vendors believe netboot is a value add and do n't support it on their low-end machines
are you hosting files from /var/www/html ?
yes , i agree with everything you have said .
1 grub entry for booting into windows boot manager has turned into 4 very weird looking ones , each with
that 's entirely not useful - go somewhere else if that 's your approach to the open source community
yes , but there are also 2/3 ( 2 set to ready ) pending landings of u-s-s
there 's only two now
i could n't exactly tell you why . if he has < winxp , i 'd tell him to gtfo
always best to practice on a disposable disk first of course
overwrite ? dont know what you mean
i'am gon na do a reboot
but if it 's writable , i 'd expect it to also be able to remove you from that group
no , i did n't ... looks interesting : - )
does it boot until the login screen ?
you 're making things complicated
how so ?
yes
that was not in the ppa , was it overlooked previous cycle ?
ah , ok , will give you the permissions then : )
yes , the readme shows what to do in the `` 1 . single-service proxying '' section
normal releases have 9 months of support , lts has 5 years
what ?
sounds reasonable to me .
disable lightdm instead of removing it .
in fact `` gconf-service '' is added
oooh ! ! ! yes makes sense
no
install lts for stable experience then : p
maybe a regression in the kernel
yes i have done .
whoh .. i am surprised .. i do not know what now to advise .. anybody else ?
no that is what the -- replace switch does it takes over for
haha
okay , that 's great to hear.. but will it also get cleaned up ? 15.04 was just unworkable on
really . could be the sim though , going to test to confirm
i was going to make that joke , but could n't figure pout a way to word it .
the only reason i say otherwise is that daviey of the release team suggested it shoudl be elevated to tb
yes , but grub is not a layer inbetween but more of a layer started before
^ ?
i fear you have to program your own desktop then , if everyone is too dumb to make it work
but if i start developing for some kde project say kate do i have to build the kdesc
there 's no way you can repro this locally ?
yes , this is normal when you have new versions , some files no longer exist and new ones exist
i used it in some cibecafes when i was like 13 ( 10 years ago ) lol
no exciting news to report other than wily does n't build mir right now : )
nope
if you 're running the lts-vivid kernel on trusty , you should n't be adding vivid sources to your sources.list
but i 'll leave it up to you
you can always enter grub recoverymode if you get into troubles
tried it
try echo 1 > /dev/wcnss_wlan
i will admit that i have a chocolate addiction so i 'm biased
but at least it builds the .pot files which qmake does n't , right ?
sounds good - we can have a simpler solution for 1.26 and one that works for 1.24 and 1.25 (
a question . should i rephrase it ?
i 'm not asking for a forum post
mostly just so i can have a few different things queued up to try out , in case ram is
.
feel free to ta
you did n't commit your changes locally
mdeslaur : at this point , are you both ok w/ me asking sru-team to push those updates out ?
nothing fancy , mostly alone and hacking , which is fine : p
no duh .
lsb_release -a says what ?
i defer to jdstrand
i may submit a patch or two to python-django
and now ?
well documentation about fixing x then
i chjecked , there does n't seem to be anything that sticks out
i find it very useful
than it is just a dns config issue , most likely .
i actually made a post on insights.ubuntu.com a month or so ago
k , ta
also try using the force option of dpkg
what i would suggest is make sure it 's disabled vi ssh , and then set a crazy hardware password
save the data ... do not copy ubuntu . do a fresh install . your system is already suspect .
thanx , then i 'll just test them all with multiboot . kind regards , c ya
surprisingly , no .
it 's just a catchy tune : )
yes , fastest thing around . tout la rage ...
yeah thats fine it is a pretty easy process
ah , right , the live-cd did n't work .
right , that 's exactly the same problem
i thing a player could plan ahead if she knows the price of upgrades and stuff fro that dialog
noted , i can put it on my todo . my poor pinky finger ...
and the server ( daemon ) mysqld ver 5.6.24-0ubuntu2 for debian-linux-gnu on x86_64 ( ( ubuntu ) )
this is in progress , it 's slowed by the fact that there is no working vivid test environment at
fyi , i 'm eating now , then looking at the mp 's
to enable performance mode of your nvidia card
sounds pretty normal . i 'm kind of stumped . : - (
thats the other problem we discussed earlier , no ?

wich ubuntu are you trying right now ?
and how do you come to that conclusion ?
yup
ah , try removing it

well it 's a bit of a warning sign for an installer not to see 8 , but you could
no problem , i have a much easier way of looking at the trace now
`` let 's punish non-qml apps by sucking system resources because qml sucks ''

it is deprecated .
no zuo no die , you zuo , you die
ah , kali is not supported here ,
he 's not big , and he 's not calm : -p
on upgrade , the data directory is copied
yeah , still sneezing a little bit , but nothing compared to last days
why unofficial ?
well it was 3 in the morning : p
sure , you still have to audit the profiles
got time for a review of goamz ?
on the armhf production machines at least ; this does n't happen with the xenial versions
sent 2 mms from free to orange , 0 received
and i do n't see any other values that do the same thing

can you shutdown -p ?
it must be much smoother
grub2 ?
it will also be really useful for debugging if you can extract the logs for the host and containers -
i know that
did you offer her a free marker pen to colour it in ?
it doesnt matter its not what i need ( or everyone for that matter ) its extremely useful to be
so it 's not important ; tools , yes
not uploaded , but almost done ( one regression left to figure out )
pushed , please make sure the commit log i made makes sense : d
most people use the ubuntu default client
there are n't many situations when you ca n't do that , or the packages from the repositories do not
you need a u1 account to sign the cla , and to push branches and make mps
when will systemd be infused into ubuntu ?
as anything with canonical cache
but i really would prefer not to do so with the first upload of a new major series package .
that said the device plugins occasionally send them , and handle unsolicited replies as well
yes confirmed - snappy rollback does not work for me either - still booted 130 / 129 now marked with
please , nope - there are loco channels for non-english discussions
yes , it 's a race condition ; adding plymouht -- wait after plymouth quit fixes it reliably here
because we should really do something with snappy and the new raspi , there is still time to think about
cool
i got the gpg setup i believe
i 've already created and published a docker image
dont have any data on ubuntu partition
define `` stalls '' please
where exactly ?
use /join
sorry i know nothing about those sort of things
and the way that 's done currently is in a loop watching to see if the worker has died

indeed , i actually have a vm for xenial server
is n't that reliable ?
every time you run autopilot , there are random failures
'ltrace -o output mount -t ntfs /dev/dm-2 /media/raid\ storage '
so what device is this ?
now it works , maybe i got some network hic-cups
yeah , but it 's not writable , mounted as ro : - )
jdstrand that means i shall rebuild and resubmit ? or do i still need for a store update ? i
do we have mir on ppc64el , for example ?
what os are you on ?

what scenario are you trying to cover ?
well , not really i guess - but others might have things to bring up ?

if it does n't find it , then it deduces that the app has been removed , and therefore removes
not seen you ask any question ,
wow , that seems kind of broken
my knowledge on how it runs is several years old , so i could n't comment on how good it
where can i specify the gid/uid mapping ?
is only mir in the silo ?
try sudo apt-get install fglrx
i was instructed to paste it here ok
hah
yeah thats the one we found
these are n't decimals , they 're version numbers : major . minor
but only for apt distros , so it 's not a good upstream solution
indeed
see kservice , it has a source code update . how do you trigger a rebuild on kci ?
so bzr bd works and dpkg-buildpage no : s
rtm or vivid ?
ca n't help with proprietary software in here really .
which host , sorry ?
try ssr
see 'alsamixer ' ; )
just trying to figure out why it wont install with the command you gave me
done
bad news , xdg-screensaver is broken in vivid
no , 15.10 is not beta
os-prober has found windows 7 !
cool , no problem
right , though broken seems more like the right description
which graphics chipset ?
looks good . i noticed there are some _lock file .
larger
can you check additional drivers ?
am i ever not around ?
oh what 's that ?
also does top show any processes consuming way too much cpu ?
i 'm fine with both , whatever you prefer ; )
do n't they use different frequencies though ?
i was already looking at it : )
do you have a desktop system ?
i type `` ping 8.8.8.8 '' and it says network unreachable

that code will be extremely very very very slow on lots of packages

noveau is not nvidia . the nvidia drivers are oem , i.e . from nvidia ...

with user friendly it uses mpathn instead of disk name which fixes the issue

still bold for me . you mean the title of the application , right ?
which ones ? i only see them in the session menu , and those are colored darkly for me

no , it 's a window manager

if you think about some new components etc . they will show up in plasma 5.3

worth a try in your case

updating a kernrel is only needed if you have *specific hardware* that 's not otherwise supported

right now , just for being here , i 'm under attack from half of china and 20 machines in
you can always restore specific files as needed if and when you encounter issues
you can still install the vendor provided package and get its updates , but that is in no way supported
was curious if it was alright under 3.19 and earlier .
what should i do now ? ?
but yeah , in theory that would indeed be enough
ok
that 's why i 've set breeze icons or different icon sets in systemsettings5 open as root , it usually

ubuntu is a debian derivative
ok
install lxde package
so , its the wireless interface , yes ?
why are you doing dist-upgrade
perrito666 fixed ( ? ) something like that recently , i believe
you said that it was harder to get people involved - was that across the board across image/release testing ?
is it just testing for existence or a successful run ?
okay , we did n't know how much experience and pain was involved : - )
it makes it really hard for app developers read their logs , as they are completely spammed by this

you can also try the mini iso , and add xubuntu do it.. after install
i write one latest tomorrow
they have some weird broadcom wifi right ?
nobody is doing your setup so it 's absolutely pointless you sharing this

it seems the prompt stuff didnt go in the backported mir
tnx a lot : )
ctrl-escape ( defualt shortcut ) , set it to 'all processes ' and sort by cpu %

i guess so

see section 4
just add a comment of your own . it does n't seem right to me . i presume you are
why ? seems rather trivial to keep it
**lots** of hardware boots ubuntu .
i have installed it but yet to find shortcute
pastebin your alsamixer settings please
which opengl settings are you using ?
what happened with yesterday 's landing ?
without defaultdependencies i 'd get a cycle
that is a separate discussion i have no horse in
you said you have no shackwave in ff plugins page ...
is ok , we take this back up later tomorrow evening after i get in from working .
and that causes enomem ?
on it now
try a reboot then opengl
awesome , i wanted qa to approve it ( but om26er found a couple of bugs ) and then i
yes , it 's still a pain for abi transitions
: d
juju-mongodb needs attention too
you can push the apparmor patch to a fork of the kernel and i can build it with the ci
the big kde releases , frameworks , plasma and applications we package in branches debian 's git
it appears to me people actually respond to requests for information on debian bugs
no windows is not important for me . i just gave that error cause i thought it might help with
no cause it has a || true
yes , that is good

ah - so when i re-test should i just add to debian.master/changelog or do i add to debian.master/changelog as well
hm acl . how to do that ?
done
i guess there is one thing how to do it for now but maybe another thing how to properly do
the package maintainer seems to always encounter some problem , so it usually takes some time until the latest stable

yes
err , when ? first i see a `` select boot device '' menu , then i select my usb
the secone ?
i do n't care how loudly you shouted at it , the snakefruit script wo n't copy if the packagelist
the only thing the intel closed driver sometimes does is hardwaredecoding of videos
apw : gotcha . my question is how exactly to do that . i tried using something like : scripts/sign-file
ok , ubuntu is first in the boot order , if you do n't have the hdd plugged in it
then why do you care ? : )
squid-forwardproxy
since vivid ?
yeah , it 's just a ci thing . because you do n't know the version that will be released
ok , type cat /mnt/etc/fstab | nc termbin.com 9999
esp . the persistent net rules
will do
i 'm not happy about reverting this ( since it 's correct ) , but less happy about spending the
you know how to insert nomodeset ?
yo\u have a msdos ubuntu and a ubuntu efi in sda
that will ignore errors and pad the blocks that have errors so the image is in sync
i 've made a blunder .
i should just do the same thing for ld_library_path
: d
oh , i suppose in that case we really will need a split .
to make them stop you need like 3 or 4 of the electro towers
or before you do that , ensure that the database is the problem : see if the files locate lists
ok then , here it goes .
64bit software would perform a bit better and in most cases there is nothing against using 64 bit
yeah reverting yesterdays commit from your side fixes the test
uncheck the `` fast boot '' thing . ask the windows support how to do that on windows 10 .
linux dominates the server and handheld markets . the only place it does n't win 100 % of the time

read the manual ?
happyaron
it was fine , heck i installed it in fine , though i have yet to boot it ( it
it 's a bit weird.. what i explained to you is correct , but indeed it does n't match what
on the phone ?
maybe some hard drive issue or whatever
so when will uitk get the landing in vivid ?
so you mean you 're no longer booted into the live session ?
on desktop , android , ios , when i try to pair it asks me 6 numbers to type on
to inform the user that he can start dragging now
no worries . yw . its unfortunate the kernel on the iso has that flaw ... and people tend to
should n't really matter that much
the error above is after removing it
i 'll have to try that once i get home
that 's the exact one , yeah
wwitzel3 reviewed that branch : )
by default you 'll have libreoffice which covers the office basics ( word prorcessing etc. ) , you have ff
yes , i can
3
so you are not running ubuntu : -d
the controls seems to be deactivated
the po they have are outdated as just written
do you even know who you are talking too ?
yeah same was here
how are you ?
it is possible to change the template container , but why do you need that ? juju also changes it
iirc , no
there 's no ssh command though and i ca n't see how to select a specific key
the next 3.16 backport will come with 14.04.2 pointrelease
weird
phone has mir .
works under windows
yeah , you say primary , i believe all partitions in uefi are logical , any one correct this if
begging wont help in any way ... what you want is not possible
the package has always been there you know : )
regular full flavor ubuntu ?
i am not having a problem installing it , my problem is with how it boots
i have the n4 as well
stop it .
sure : )
ok , these things are a process of ellimination .
eth0
both actually ...
you think its the internal gpu ?
that 's one possibility
yes
hu ?
you cant downgrade the whole ubuntu release
uhhh ok this does not look good . when i do that cat command i get : `` error :
i hope you find the same benefit
btw , when i was on 12.04 , i remind now that i used exactly go-mtpfs to connect android ,
yes , but usually not for the operating system itself .
scanned it , will check again
thus it is broken and does n't laucnh ubuntu.desktop xsession correctly .
popularity is irrelevant , lu and xu are for lower spec systems , kubuntu and ubuntu for higher spec -
dunno sgclark 's been doing that
hey , that 's me : - ) i 'd recommend doing the setup first . the task you are
you just asked me if it always skips
yw , i had to look for it too , so decided to save you the trouble heh
ci has started testing your revision
applying the firmware on an existing install may cause data loss , thats why fresh install
so something like a private lib
well `` sudo apt-get upgrade '' or dist-upgrade show which are to go on , you want more than that
how did you try to install it ?
i did see a deprecation warning for zone europe-west1-a
apparently we 've lost write access to the db
it should be a file
yes
it did n't know what to do with it .
anyhow for that 'postfix ' stuff a satellite config or 'ssmtp ' is good as < shauno > said .
new debdiff on the bug then
you have to ask a more specific question to get any form of response
that and rgba headerbar windows
we got a new casper , you might watn to wait for that
nope
killed and requeued . i do n't think anyone needs to twiddle the mp that was stalled
if this fails after reboot , you could try xubuntu/lubuntu
i have a process question / comment for you
sure .
we tend to prefer the latter , but if packaging changes are equally important in this case , the former
i believe this is correct
`` sudo cat /proc/1493/ { exe , cmdline } '' might help determine what that process is
indeed , that 's why i try and avoid using them at all costs : )
same url ?
wait
well telnet fails so wget does too
i thought you meant it was easy to break into peoples houses or something
then i would likely say something else is going on if its multiple issues
does the minimal installer offer full-disk encryption ?
try rebooting
lets all get back on topic then
well , i have n't had issues with installing 14.10 on systems personally , so it 's not *universal* at

you are of course right and this works
in standup now , will reply in ~20m
so third token was correct . because you ca n't have push notifications without a u1 account : )
use the bios mode
looking
.cache/upstart/dbus.log says : /proc/self/fd/9/ : 3 : /proc/self/fd/9 : initctl : not found
yea , aks for password
it 's not a module , apparently it just needs a new enough kernel due to ioctl request id helper
you need mp urls not lp : branch shortnames
no , we do n't screenshot text ... we pastebin it
what 's the issue with the full sync ? data download ? cpu use ? did we quantify that somewhere
yeah , so , my vague recollection is that we actually intended to make it essential as part of the
( lp : # xxxx ) added to mate-menu and mate-tweak .
should we use network.id or string in mongo ?
the issue is that the api uses oauth
wee !
also , elopio could have another look if you 'd like
livecd
you might run into some poorly written software that does n't follow the rules , but i ca n't name

i was thinking the driver might not show unless xorg is running
if you see in a script or at the terminal `` . /path/to/some/file '' that `` . '' is short
is that the sudoers thing ?
ok ... .. hmmm did you just did ? for that takes effect only on newly opened apps : )
will status stuff dump out to logs ?
what are you talking about ? are you saying you ca n't use this system right now ?
what zetheroos actual problem was
no , i 'm about to start debugging it again
assuming you can log in to a terminal you can show grub by editing a file

can you ping any other site except your homedomain ?
ok , i will double check again
i did check it , it works just fine if the machine boot from the dvd .
maybe the # ubuntu-server guys might know the newest tricks in the house : p
what branch is that and what does it do ?
ahhh , is this a monitor with it 's own screen , or a desktop machine ?

yes , it is 1 year old

yep
turn csm legacy to disabled and uefi on and it should boot
what i want ( in a virtualbox so it is ok to do ) : boot , sutologin as user
still looks clear , just no subtitles
ok. you wan na publish it or should i ?
before nm and /etc/init.d/networking , but we can make that stronger ( make network-pre.target come after apparmor )
include the full path in the name of the tarball .
o/
is there some documentation / instructions about how to write a provider ? ( is this something i could contribute
sent
but there is a commitment to have a release before the expected date of ota9 ?

whats with the ! , guessing that means you agree
i did try fixing it , but gave up because it was n't easy without refactoring the way the filter

it appears to be a wm . so what is your real question here ?
oh sure , did n't realize i had overlapped
i assume so , i mean i followed the fish instructions

yes
out-of-memory killer , segmentation faults , kernel panics , block io errors , etc etc..

i guess not , anyhow , i 'll get a bug filed and someone to fix 'er up
i still think the subnetinfo as single lines would be too long and harder to read
are you using iptables or ufw or similar firewall on this system ?
are you trying to overcome a crowded frequency band , or some interference you 've identified ?
i thought adding it to the bashrc would be the same as adding more locations , yes ?
in case you did n't notice yet , i needed to do a small change to autopkgtest for the upstart-sysv
if it runs while root is still r/o , we know even less about the state of the system
how do i build each one of those ? the element14 one does not have a readme

you missed a chance for silly naming here . i 'm disappointed .
so you got ta figure out which one you 're going to keep
this is easy to explain . a tool is a phone , that cost 130 euro
well , it 's not conceptually wrong as long as you do n't take /sbin/init changes into account , but
desktop themes ?
why ? i though we have those versions so the code would be compatible and not break existing apps ?
why ?
no problem
did you have a ffe for that update ?
doing that now
yeah , libgtk-3-0 deps on libmirclient8 ( > = 0.12.1+15.04.20150324 )

yes

willcooke , do we expect the scrollbar changes to land for wily ? we probably need ffe/uife for that
which other flags does it need
fyi : with trunk , if you have 2 maximized and 1 normal window , the maximized ones will disappear
you wan na time the transfer of the data from usb to pc ?
lets recap your config
then , it 's pretty easy to try it out - juju environment set-constraints mem=8g tags=foo , bar ; then
owncloud but that 's just me
the ubuntushape we use all over does pretty much the same
it 's lunch break now : d
maybe i 'm just assumign something wrong . but what i 'm saying is 'udevadm settle ' should have completlye
it 'll change a bit over the next couple of days
but sfdisk no longer supports megabytes as units , so i 'm switching to using sectors as the units .
ok
how did you uninstall the default drivers ? what apt command did you use ?
kfilemetadata and baloo pushed
imho it 's much simpler ( and much more parallel ) to just call ifup after you created the definition
it 's mine , yes . there are no kernels
awesome - so i 'll keep ur shipit : )
maybe yours is , but i was addressing someone else : )
is the instance running in the ec2 ui ?
right click on the titlebar choose more actions , then special applications settings , postion and size set to remember
create a reservation for a specific mac address .
what chipset is your graphics card ?
it used to be 10.04 before 12.04.01 was around : )
what is the guest account ?
i installed samba but do n't know how to do this .
apt-get install haskell-platform ?
best of luck : )
once it is build like the others it shoudl show up in the official download space
so could i populate a linux spreadsheet using the .txt file that was provided to me ?
there was some drafting for it in the whiteboard for that blueprint
*and a lot of ram .
btw you might be able to still access it and fix the mbr from there , it 's a long
was getting a cuppa : )
thnx
hmpf ... clicking the +es does something
as much as i enjoy , we do n't use lmgtfy in this channel .
you could say that
and it should probaly go in the install section , so they actually read it when installing !
hg532s , huawei
when i try to populate the products it returns a failure
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf is what you want
great ! let 's prepare it for chroot then . `` for n in proc sys dev dev/pts run etc/resolv.conf
monkeydust has knowledge on this than i do . i 'm on xubuntu so things are a bit different
it goes nicely hand in hand with the non-working nearby scope ... all fine : )
yes . but both are equally stable ?
yeah , it 's easy to do the juju/names pr first
yes so that would be only possible when we sru that toolchain back
i would like help
then sudo mount /dev/sdxy /mnt , and sudo mount /dev/sdxy /mnt/boot/efi ( for the efi partition )
first sentences from the article given , regarding ufw : `` the default firewall configuration tool for ubuntu is ufw
you should ask clurr , not me : -p
have you rebooted after you removed it ?
sounds like you 're in the tall grass
ca n't seem to figure the name for my screen though , tried lvds ( zero ) and ( letter
aha , that 's actually something i checked too , but the makefile in the project i 've got open
you came in cloaked
it 's always exciting time in some ways ; - )
will the new upstream stuff make it easier ?
you can try if the network/interfaces approach and if that is running prior to the nm
im searching for gui app for device manager
ok
ecm was outdated
do you think that 's sufficient documentation ?
then boot into previous kernel..
just out of curiousity , what permissions should i be doing if this server is online ?
i made the mistake of upgrading my laptop to vivid . how do i ( 1 ) do the equivalient
virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11
so it is simply a matter of modifying the /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf file ?
its an internal hdd , could the mbr or those boot related things do anything fishy ?
sure , though valorie did more . : )
you 'd better double check though : )
ya , what is the current version ?
cat /proc/cmdline
state/backups/backups_linux.go
check dmesg
product : gk106 [ geforce gtx 660 ]
yeah , through a ppa basically
best to ask the channel with your actual question to get a reply
why do you want ntfs ?
ok , so the drive is still good : )
i was looking at it to find out if the netinst image had any wifi drivers . it does ,
but i was surprised that one or both of cluster- { broken , departed } were n't called on other
but instead of width : parent.width binding , i 'd suggest you to switch to anchoring
kde
no from 13.04
so far so good , altho x crashed a few mins ago i recovered from the vt
`` nautilus . '' might work
you ca n't , i can
if that 's doable now via the newer onlineaccountsclient api in a single call , that 's fine ; but
yeah , just wanted to confirm the 14.x kernel raid drivers are backward compatible with 12.x
i got - click link - ff opens new instance at 'home ' iirc
ok . i am unsure how to make a combo with xmodmap . i would like alt+up/down arrow to be
i 'm 95.989 % of the way to solving it
cut+paste ( and edit ) would be fine ?
details matter . so show it in a pastebin please
can you browse into that .img file with it ?
ok , cool
give me a moment , spinning the computer up ; just took updates
let me try my google-foo to see if we have a fix for this
also , i 'd like to removev the 4.14 kernel , is it alright to uninstall the 4.14 packages while
did n't know , lol
you have .4 , the issue is fixed in .5
ok , sorry for bugging you
are you typing from that live session now ? ( boot to 'try ' mode )
yw
yes . we should be able to run these on the device itself now . i assume that will fix
advanced prog for bash
xubuntu 12.04 is available as well and comes with xfce4
ca n't think of anything funny to reply with : (
did you run sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get upgrade earlier ?
for some reason i expected a peace man \/m
should i create a directory beginning with `` . '' ?
yup , understand
( i.e . it is used , you just ca n't see it )
it 's fixed in vivid and on the vivid images , but not on the rtm image apparently
open software center . the search for vlc . click install button
snprintf ( ) is so much safer and avoids these gotchaas
this is for desktop .
imagine remembering a 128 bit long password ?
i did try it with __jfdi__ but i fluked a test
whats your exact desire ?
most machines perform well on ubuntu
i am scheduled to propose it tomorrow
click at the '' technical detal '
tried the accepted solution there and it is still using ipv6
i 'm thinking of chucking out the diskformatter , and creating a new filesystem provider . the storage provisioner will
i really do n't know yet : ) i 've never used those ipmi cards on linux
that got superceeded by the next neutron upload ( which contained this fix as well )
you will also have to remove some default shortcuts
the team did some work in our sprint a couple of weeks ago but got held up that i 'd
i remember i explained to you the other day
could you point me to the files having those qs ?
ok , let me try
did you run my last command ?
every step i 've tried so far from ubuntu help pages made the problem a step worse
that 's pointless . all manufacturers have good and bad batches/models
reverted to stock wily unity , rebooted , logged in ( had a separate issue i will mention in a
you came to ubuntu to ask about alternatives to ubuntu ? strange . suggest you seek alternatives in # #
if you 're comfortable with what 's in the ppa , i can quickly do a release of 0.8.1 and
ok , you guys can just ping me then
i forgot my laptop charger for the night and i wan na know how much time i have left :
ah fair enough i thought there were
ip is for release
what do you need your os to do ?
good night !
that 's the current version for 12.04 . if you want something more up to date , you 'd have
remember to reboot after change /etc/hostname
open the file manager and drag and drop
sure , np . it 'll be a while before i can lay my hands on it
hein ?
anywhere you want . this is not upload to spi , this is upload to any storage . what we
yes . in gparted i am looking them at the moment ...
its something i look at every few updates on rc to see if something new there : p
yes , apart from ui to change binding
you should git push origin kubuntu_wily_archive
note that if your ppa is virtualized ( the default ) , we 've seen trouble with that sometimes ,
could you suggest a bootable system with recovery tools ?
ok first step would be this : get the debug log for music-app when playing a file with a #
wait
just wasnt sure if he had it mounted or not
that 's good to know . should be easy enough to track down then .
^
you can use sed and regular expressions
i have n't ever tried that with lowercase filenames either , but i guess it could work if you create
do you still have the install media you used to install the system ?
eds will create source for his service , buteo will create source for it service , and both will download
lspci | pastebinit
yeah , i 'll create a bug for that as well as the `` n connected clients '' bit .
i have a question , how do i burn a windows.iso to a disk using ubuntu 15.04 ?
sturmflut has a wishlist
possible ?
both of these are for spaces
trying out -- build to see if taht will update me to 3
aye . wouldnt want that .
are you on vivid maybe ?
no . you have to select a project to post a bug against . not a team .
a lot of effort just to root some phones and play dos games . heh .
you have 2 surplus kernels ( its good to keep the one before the active kernel ) .
yeah makes sense . good excuse to learn the code a bit : )
actually , i do n't think that fixing this in cloud-init is going to fix it
simply run the patcher with all architectures ?
sure , we can remove also the builddebs function
btw , did you find in the end somebody that could help me with testing sosh operator ?
ubuntu support here , chat in # ubuntu-offtopic
reboot . come back and attempt the bcmwl-kernel-source* dpkg again
wazzup ?
they should block out 15 minutes of every hour to update the social feeds . : )
yes
yeah it should n't be the port issue since rabbitmq-server is exposed
ok , so something else is applying the rules then , if that file is empty
you can ? just disable secure boot , if it is even enabled
should 've been $ ( ls /var/ ...
no kill with -usr1 prints progress
yeah can do
so is it a common message while installing all antivirus or
yeah , it does n't work like it should . see bug 1434591
if the mouse just failed , grab the logs as per the bug report - they may reveal why it
from the bundle ?
this id should be truly unique
atum , yes i 'm using it for reverse proxy
hehe , and opening the parking lot show 's already some cards
i mean , i asked it here as an ubuntu user and in kubuntu as a kde user ... i
does precise got your card by default ?
which phone are you using ?
will keep it vivid only for now . that silo more a demo silo atm
yep
but it 's best to build in a clean environment so i have a local chroot that recreates a clean
any other os installed ? like windows dualboot etc ?
rejected , and bug updated ( you can re-use the same version number )
webchat . i have irssi open too
no . but we consume an old diverged fork , and would like to switch to consuming a converged ,
is it those dmesg entries from above ?
grab the dmesg and lspci -nn
on your pc you dont use unity8 or mir .
no : ) . otp right now . i 'll get back to you in a sec .
but that 's really hard
so look at the startup programs for that then
the one patch for the mysqld seems like it 's pointing at a super old version .
i 'm running proprietary drivers , though . will they work ?
you never used the teamspeak client on windows ?
done
there is n't oe
ok so right now results wo n't be succesfully uploaded to pt without a system-image resource job
it 's the sync from vivid
i ca n't compare ? is't the kernel compatible to both operation systems ?
the thing that will break it is a change from qt 5.4 to 5.5
see the channel topic
ask aptana support . looks like you 're using a version of aptana meant for a different distro , or
ok
ok thx , trying now
and systemctl status p910nd_p910nd_0.97 after the start ? still nothing ?
flash drives are n't 'powered off ' - can you be more clear ?
ok
really ?
reading .
oh i thought they were still
no : )
is the vga connection listed though ?
a personal package archive ( ppa ) can provide alternate software not normally available in the offical ubuntu repositories -
might be easier to just use canonistack ?
i can try with non-secure connections enabled
to do what
i ca n't decide between chaos/madness on one side and the artiodactyl on the other
right , filed ticket and found the correct owner of qa.reqorts who fixed the issue ; if it happens again
right ? as it 's semantically `` add a space that already exists with the provider ''
whats not working
nope
can i do that on upload , or will that disrupt some git ?
yes apparently picasa is back with a revenge ; )
i have a general understanding of what curl is ... i 'm not going to run rm -rf * or
so all canada is just quebec ? thought so !
wmv
sudo apt install firefox
i know
hum , did you really generate it like that ? some upstream patches like the fsck one are n't in
can they ping each other ?
i do n't recall
just seed the torrent . seeding always starts slow until you get peers
yup . while we are ready with our throwable instances .
approved : d
does mumble count ?
you should be able to add `` nouveau.blacklist=1 '' to your kernel line in grub .
^
since we 're talking team updates , how 's it going with the wallpaper ? any eta on that ?
best to ask your specific issue with it , to this channel so others can help
indeed it looks like changelog got borked - the last entry is replaced with the new one
that 's bug 1430280 ; it has instructions how to fix it locally
i 've got to do some upgrade testing anyway - so i 'll autologin test while doing the update-manager test
fwereade is thinking about it : - )
ca n't really promise that it will work perfectly.. but the stuff in your home folder will probably work
you have a pr : )
why ?
indeed . but if our council is anything to go by , they want big-name `` beacon brands '' to
yeah nas appliances with two bays can run raid 1 too .
hum , that 's certainly odd .
from local unity8
still relevant you want the lightest anything you net install . ; )
but , now we need it to do more ...
when you get around let me know if your on telegram
thoughts ? do you agree ?
nope , not here ... . driver issue perhaps ? nvidia ?
^^
i 'm using puppet @ that part ... so i 'm kinda bound to it for 300 servers
do you happen to know ...
you definitely have all the listeners up ?
i 'll keep the tab open , but i may not get to it until tomorrow ; )
that sounds like windows bootloader menu with those choices , as opposed to grub 's
no prob
yeah i will ask jhodap when he comes online
and in any case , we need some sort of ui feedback ( i 'm shutting down because of inactivity-like
i thought about using the attempt code , but it did n't really fit with the pattern i wanted ,
mtk-tools is designed for the board and flashing images mostly it is not how you would backup android you would
what i 'm saying is it might be broken or suboptimal , but it mostly works , minus some warts
why specifically that one ?
you can just type it all into a pastebin and paste that link .
i did not ask it right . i mean the unity left panel . the line with the launcher
: )
is the only change that it 's wily- > dual ? or did you change other stuff too ? i
ok , cool : )
ubuntu version ?
creating an image for your device is probably a matter of several months of work for an experienced programmer
it should be there , look for torbrowser
once i looked in the correct area of the mobo it all became clear : ) i 've been focused
maybe the theme already adds such styles to slider images
the command i just gave you
no , we 've not made any actual changes for external tarballs yet , just emailed people to tell them
will try - this server is in moscow and i 'm in london so coordinating is hard - i have
what does `sudo lxc-ls -- fancy` show on the remote server ?
that ca n't be
vga ? dvi ? hdmi ?
maybe it will get you less lag on openssh-server and openssh-client ?
but i have confirmed the new qtmir does not reproduce the bug anymore
although we have started changes things here and there to have more generic telepathy support , that 's not fully
we might kick a new image in ~1 hour if you 're ok with that , as i 'm investigating
i can probably find out which ones are the important ones
it 's probably best if you link us to the tutorial you 're following so we have some context and
i 'm going to direct you to mvo_ for how to contribute processes , but essentially , check out a
definitely *without* dates : )
apticron or something , you can tell it to either install , or mail about them etc .
the error you posted was nothing about that
i already did few days ago they say beter ask in # ubuntu but im gon na give it a
what ubuntu version are you running ?
try esc , or right shift might work
the issue is whether the machines are busy making a build
that 's correct
ok , then let 's just make it nodisplay=true
or mterry may also know
likely , you are not pressing the keys necessary to actually initiate the function keys.. on my keyboard , i
no worries . just growing pains for the new dual landing feature
i am not that expert but you can clean by using apt-get purge
prove it please ?
you `` tell '' what you need by seeing what kernel you are using , and keeping that one
and ... change it quickly
gunnar : this is a ubuntu support channel , let 's keep this specifically related to support questions
yes , debian forwards would be ok , but you probably ca n't reproduce on these architectures
lol
and how did windows handle it ?
parent.parent.focused = score1 ... or change it to type button and do this
a test in our security panel starts a session bus
we have images for 15.04
ah
that 's always been for switching environments ...
i should n't be able to push anyway as mere devs do n't have push rights to core repo
yes as soon as the android hal container has initialized the hardware
get somebody in ~ci-train-ppa-service to use the retry function directly in the ppa
you can edit the nm connections with `` nmcli ''
set a main shortcut
i ca n't see anything about that said in the release notes . that said kubuntu does n't have some
what 's busybox ?
uhuu !
i was just looking at the maas test results for 1.22 revision 79e5ea8a and still see the failure mentioned in
i agree that changing version everytime you change a pkg is right , but since this pkg never existed ,
`` eventos para hoy : 0 ''
and so 16 becomes 11 , as i guess oxide is the priority item
no
nope , all clear .
is n't the original bug about getting disconnected vs upgrading ?
let me give that a shot
it 's a console
oh , ok. well something goofed up during the merge then . i manually merged it myself , so it
that is not the resposibility of the charm
sooooo
ok so really it 's just format support , you do n't need codecs from some windows installer at all
you 're right , it would be a string . but it 's not the doc 's id i 'm
insserv : fopen ( .depend.stop ) permission denied
ok
and ubuntu didnt boot when i removed my efiboot
grub can install an optional alias file `` /boot/grub/device.map '' that maps physical system device names ( /dev/sdx ) to
if i made it right
honestly i do not know i am having trouble locating it hence the issues
lol ... . just a figure of speech , really
ack , makes sense . so i would propose to just add it to the cli , with the cli
that 's what rbasak linked to : )
yw
: p
well just for the sake of reply ... ok i wont log in as a root.. : p
) this is not useful , though , because no bug reports are sent to anyone when it crashes like
can you explain - since im a fedora/opensuse user - i have to use kubuntu a work
well , if it works , sounds good to me
why would it mean that ?
yup
yeah
right ; we do n't have token expiration times in u1
if you 're removing the whole project , you need me to delete the ppa package . otherwise you 're
in the same way do n't install bad ppa packages
daftykins as i said earlier ; we 've seen similar systems where the ssd is actually on a special intel
we 've already added several new features
and how can i be involved ?
i would mention how to run them using the sdk if you do n't mind
( one specific test )
can you get in through the command line client ?
do we need any other ports also to be forwarded
i would , but unfortunately , mac os x still does n't have that , i use it on my
ah , obfuscated drive . probably '0 ' in place of 'n ' ?
qa = testing : d
what guest os are you trying to use ? are you confident the guest ought to work with the selected
and ?
i 've at least sorted out how to force it to boot to the sd when i hold the boot
whats too complicated ? : )
i know of it , i have used it back in 07/08
can you take a look at the blueman merge , i 'm not 100 % sure about the python patch
use inkscape
same with el7 ( eg rhel 7.x )
ok , i 'm here if you need help
how about recoverymode failsafex ?
i 'm pretty convinced it did . as i said , i certainly did n't ( and it 's branded
open synaptic or software center , search for `` linux image generic '' see what comes up . remove older
wich ubuntu version is this ?
lucky we have telegram now
i ca n't tell you for sure , i have n't really touched that bit of the charm .
i like it i just dont like not being able to choose the temperature
silos assigned : )

you need it for skype and wine
`` man shutdown '' , find the -h option .
well it appears that poll # 1 has slowed right down now numbers wise
the default is allow all traffic
do any of your other media keys work ?
do you have dual gpus ( switchable grapichs ) in your laptop ?
yes
cool , was this all part of the reason for your trip ?
only in ispconfig.vhost , will do the apps now
why then worse openjdk such worse performance compared to the original ?
dunno , try to google it using name of driver and `` transmit power '' or maybe `` tx power
timeframe ?
what exactly is not working as you expect
you could try using the guest account to see if it 's your user or a system-wide setting or something
odd question , what do you think of fxos
explain a bit more ?
i get 0
nah , that was a false positive . literally just whitespace in the diff . i waived it through
there is a trick from windows to boot into your uefi
that and your default language is english ; )
mir creates a socket file
and no , dpkg is built with keeping user changes in mind
do the permissions look like they shuold allow the minecraft user and group the ability to read and write what
heh , yeah . i was looking at that too : )
no car ?
looks fine ?
perhaps that 's what you need ?
try the following : $ sudo chown -r < user > : < user > /home/ < user >
push notifications ? go via the server
or ensure that my change does n't break them
really nice and cool
i guess i 've got that then : d
try different usb ports
you need a builddep on libpeas-dev to get the .pc files
simple as drinking water .
but nothing delivered to it
what i was thinking on doing was upgrading to windows 10 when it comes out , as in my case
dd ?
so remove this one : linux-lts-vivid-cloud-tools-common
just wiping ~/.cache/qml before the ap-test-run is n't enough , because the shell-rotation ap-test is using scenarios now - upon
and pastebin the results.txt that it produces .
seriously , yes . i do n't have much choice .
define `` old ubuntu '' .
why not a tablet ?
secureboot is wonky , if its enabled it could be the reason it is not booting
that does not allow me to mount the encrypted directory , does it ?
if im using usc
i agree
silo 16 is good from my perspective - at least it fixes the trust prompt issue it was supposed to
ok , so you need single source
his changelog is a diff between the manifests of the rootfs , it should be rather reliable
i did file a but a while ago that it wo n't ever pass if the timeout is not increased
i386 also fails
same here , it 's cause the laptop is still plugged in
i 'll remember that
how do i unset it in xubuntu 14.04 ?
the worst thing that can happen is that you 're til
there is an issue with service .
it 's not that it allows you to write to /var/log/blah.log
might be
we could just make our own repository for it that does n't have upstream branch . or we could just
so if you have the original ubuntu version installed and run the regular updates your system is fixed
so you are compiling something on a trusty system with vivid binaries ? i now understand why your compiler is
i dont know what his app does .
i can understand why it works that way . otherwise the bot would have to keep state about each pr
you could also build your own binary : )
i had the bq device for a weekend . it was really nice .
looks like tree is not necessarily installed , but it 's very handy
2gb ? ? no wonder..
maybe reinstall fresh , before the update ?
i do not understand your question ? , i do not use kde , what kde error ? , you
so again , that 's autopilot guys : )
# 1 looks weird there
i thought you are from russia wanted to explain to you in their native language : )
go ask rhonda @ # ubuntu-motu
studio_ wants to use desktop functions and does not understand the concept of a phone , despite many many people
sorry wrong channel : - (
good morning !
boost1.55 fixed build failures , for reverse-deps , that compile with gcc5 & 98abi .
oh your saying stuff that has been *added* can not be seen ?
cool !
ok , i 've assigned it to me
depends .
before you dualboot on uefi machine its best to read the help pages
well i know it is correct .
found it.. logging in
kk . anyone else know what do to ?
which version of ubuntu are you using ?
nods
tell me if this returns a path : `` which pastebinit ''
did it not dim ?
did you set defaultdependencies=no ?
note , this will need a manual security ack from jdstrand or someone on the security team as it has
could you elaborate on what the action is ?
yeah , weird
i 'm not certain that i agree
pkill gnome-screensaver
mac link
it would make sense plus we move snappy into a snap
if i can revive my phone : p
please start another ssh connection and `` systemctl status lightdm '' again , while keeping the `` systemctl start lightdm
oh , from torsten franz ! yes , i saw that one , too . : )
i promise to fall on the grenade if it blows up after merging .
ack
i appear to already have those changes in my test branch from merging it earlier
i 've checked out the plugin and googled ; it seems that puppet works with profiles imported or created .
`` sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists ''
infinity waves back
i generally use apt/dpkg myself , but i am thinking of the gui people
i assume we have other code that will ask for charm.v4 that wants the actual v4 branch
you using mako or krillin ?
more than one hd per chance ?
right now frameworks can export binaries , but not libs
now we try to start unity and monitor the messages you get in the terminal you just logged into
oh
so they require nbs removal in sid before something can migrate , which gives them a wholistic view , we
would this be the problem ?
ohh right.. that 's in autopilot
so now you can just type `` im '' and it 'll autocorrect to `` i 'm ''
h , did nobody land that yet
there are several differences in *how* they do it , but maybe they look the same for you . as
sed . its a editor which edits without showing you . it works with regular expressions
you have mail : )
do n't be a jerk
i just find it strange i get 1 frame ( which would be a poor security authenticator )
fix your driver : )
danke
saucy
is it possible you *also* have chromium-browser installed ?
perfectly ok , i though everything was approved , jhodapp went through both branches
i retract my statement that it 's nasty
i used putty to log into `` foreignip '' 's machine .
adding a mockreleaser wo n't make it less complicated
what makes you think that ?

at least here on linux ...
those are pretty

but expect the hole to be closed `` soon ''
they ca n't coexist , it 's still right for the newer ones to c/r the older ones .

ah cool
well essentially , if you 're saying you 're installing software ... you 're going to run out of space
oh good question , i ca n't remember asking for that to be setup , so probably not
my commiserations ...
i personally think this would be quite an interesting project
sorry , you seem to be on top of it

no idea what 's up , then . sorry , i ca n't be more helpful .
is there someone who can help us clean these up ?
can you spend an hour and co-ordinate with jfunk if a whole story is needed
no over the internet .
sudo dpkg -i -- force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/kde-config-telepathy-accounts_4 % 3a15.08.2-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb

how old is the battery ?
they added a moot autopkgtest to just go through building the package , which runs the usual unit tests

great ! : ) mine is stuck updating
maybe ... certainly not a reasonable amount of time : )
: d we discuss everything in here : d
does your app contain compiled code ? i did n't think it did , but that 's when i 've
hey
before then , enable developer mode , download and install phablet-tools , make the device writable
the live session wo n't be affected , it would only be the ubiquity installer session that would use feh

why bother ? ubuntu ca n't be installed to windows ntfs formatted drives
sounds good . ssweeny might take that one once he finishes the async provider stuff
what does the host system have ?
try booting the usb alone in uefi mode
why is vsync disabled by default ? does it not causing tearing for everyone else too ? or is it
lol
davidcalle , dpm , mhall119 , popey : team call ?
the above bot 's message shows you why dist-upgrade installs new kernels but upgrade does n't
so not like in here then ; )
can you point me to how it is ? all i can see are a bunch of unprotected fields in
krillin/vivid
err , wat ?
i just updated it to the latest .
right
mocking out the actual running of the upgrade steps and just confirming that they would be run is probably enopugh
only kvm .
where do you see this issue ?
i have a bad news , so i hope you feel well : )
it 's in 17 , bfiller said `` no because gallery-app click package does not need ui-extras0.2 yet and we
right
no , i rebased , so it wo n't merge against our feature branch
can you switch the card to amd from bios ?
since they depend on udm
ogra_ : i actually did propose tp use the same timerd as used in meego , but the idea was
that 's fine then
2d is deprecated since ubuntu 12.10 though
k
i did not . is it causing problems ?
did that
do you have grub installed ?
maybe we should subscribe strikov and rbasak
we 're probably going to go with option 2 for the case where jesse ran into this today ( not
that wo n't work atm
hm , that 's a question for the core apps developers . rpadovani might know .
let 's move this to # ubuntu-iap-pilot , because i ca n't see the relevant people around here
do we know when background audio in oxide will happen ?
i would guess that if apn info is required to identify the network then indeed it might not show up
ok added
i really do n't know , i know next to nothing about this whole plugin
lol your such an out-of-the-box thinker : p
you will find lots of documentation and tutorials to get you going
that would be great !
no , the `` rotation : 90 '' actually does the trick
and if the answer is `` i started now , so now plus 8 hours '' , do you have
`` sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall `` will do all drivers and microcode available
aha , so i remembered right ...
this if for things like ubuntu-device-flash i guess ?
on nexus 5 , mir-demos can be installed . however , program can not work well .
yes . we start the sprint on monday .
what do you program in ?
daemon returned nothing ? is that normal ?
just wanted to prove it 's on the way ...
i had that in one of my apps from before the release
pastebin lsblk output
should be in the journal , or systemctl status -l networking
rdeps grass and qgis will also take long to build
and/or sshd is n't running .
just using a bunch of signal watchers and properties to wait until ofono is done initializing
can you review the one for indicator-display ?
and with that alternate command you just did you 've potentially corrupted the check-new-release exectuable !
the fast way to get around it is find the deb files in /var/cache/apt/archives for the ones it does n't
i tried to find it en gconf-edit but no luck
it can sometimes happen that the first publication of a new ppa occurs before the signing key is generated .
or is yours fresh completely ?
you having it shipped to someone in the uk ?
if you 're serious , talk to me sometime about it .
i was saying , if you wanted to update the py3 changes , i 'll land that now as well
i 'm surprised you have a phone booting with a current wily image on it : )
it only ever parses `` foo.desktop '' if user asked for `` foo '' but how would a user know
argh . i had to restore that vm node from a back yesterday and the backup must have been missing
i have a couple of review needing to be done also when you are fee : - ) since you
i used unity tweak tool to get the legacy scrollbars ( disables the stupid overlay scrollbars )
how much memory / cpu / disk ?
in # juju on canonical , roaksox is saying that it does n't matter and we should use the unreserved
all tests pass though , and it seems like a *wise* change
i do n't remember what 's the file extension abbv . for that
26 i tested against
yeah , it does
i ask again , friend . are you using ubuntu 14.04 or 14.10 ?
we start off from a pre-built image , and can put snaps on top . ci wo n't care how
that is 2 commands to start networking and 1 to verify .
but automatic updates via the icon are handy , to know when new updates are available
you rock !
indeed
lspci fisrt to see it it is recognized
you changed something with backgrounds in some cards recently , right ?
no
presumably that would fix this
when : but i didt do this yet gnome-screensaver-preferences
what daftykins said
we may have a better idea in an hour or so 's time
chrome from ppa for me . just avoids getting caught by flash when i 'm using ff for normal browsing
we ca n't pull in non-trunk charms . it requires code/changes to charmstore and means every dev branch would be
did you hear belgium gon na make special pedestrian lines to walk with smartphones , for 'safety '
both done
not really what i want ... my problem is that a directory ( mime type inode/directory ) gets opened with
well , cool
looks like it 's due to tagging
( temporary )
i understand . so there is no some special name for this standard flavor ?
the known apps are a dictionary that has app name and desktop file .
no problem : )
on that now
right , and if we had atomic/isolated txns we could do that , but we do n't
i did that last week actually
if i made a windows repair disc would i be able to bring my system back to when i made
ah , so this pr only adds support into the dummy provider
so , is the dialler a `` normal '' qt app with a qml frontend ?
how much ram do you have ?
that 's still not built into the official tool set
ur thoughtfulness is highly appreciated !
i did , and now i can execute commands from the terminal again !
yeah its what i thought the script is trying to execute too early
yah i saw the chroot method
ok
can we use the gui for ui design yet ?
labeling ubuntu a trash distro , not the best way to get support in future
i 'll do some searching online fore the drivers : p
it is pretty slow , fswebcam takes a long time to fetch the picture each time
yeah , hopefully i am . : )
alright , look for it in /etc/init.d/*subsonic* , that seems likely
check what it taking the space , then we can help what you can delete
that can be assumed safely , yes : )
technically , yes , find can do that , but i 'd like to do it manually for the reason
well , whatever , how do i fix it ?
turn on the system how ?
you are trying to mount it as nfsv4 , while the server provides a share for nfsv3 only .
give it a user does n't matter which one
i 'm sure mjt will have opinions . he tends to have those .
when testing the screenshot feature , please not how does long-vol-press behave
you have to boot legacy and install as legacy for the ssd to boot as legacy \o/
iiuc , the tab should stall on a short swipe , showing all tabs open
sudo parted -l | nc termbin.com 9999
it 's not renamed because the sover changed ?
the pause and such that is
you got to get up the speed
that one is sharing with trunk too , confirmed
community donations , i guess .
yes you re correct
oh ? bug with upgrade log appreciated
it is definitely open source , just like xchat
apport is the crash capture and reporting too . it is worth letting it post a bug report ... and
yea
i do n't really have the imte to investigate binaries
depending on which order that happens in make , you get 3.4 or 3.5
false alarm - as you were , the command is ok
daily ? stable enough for work use/
yep
not at all . just all the applications have to use jack as their output .
yup works fine here
ok , you still have a boot cd/usb , right ?
ah , i appear to have wasted most of the day : )
i dont see anything in my file manager now . how can i make them visible so that i can
dunno
well , my php had a tendancy to look like my perl ... .so what does that tell you ?
some people are using the vivid vervet currently , what 's happening ?
it does n't look like you reconfigured ...
they are api additions , dropping them would mean abi break
the cursor moves - but it doesnt zoom in on the one desktop
have you tried other ubuntu versions on the pad ?
is your power supply beefy enough to support all of your hardware ?
you should describe your problem ...
good pickups on the other issues ; i 've explained one point , hopefully it makes sense
and you can then start ubiquity from there ?
could you review this please
ic
the vg is already plenty large enough . it 's the lv that 's our problem .
do n't worry , you do n't use it : )
just check apt-cache search cinnamon first as well
would be good as well
ifconfig eth0 mtu xxx ? i tried that
why only now ?
happy2help !
i 'm not using uefi at all . i did n't understand what you mean about boot/sleep is not used
qml-cache issue can be avoided by unsetting qv4_enable_jit_cache ... this is n't really an issue that branch is meant to
ok cool . i 'll probably have to look at those tomorrow .
kylin was always kind of weird
install a new distro
if the failure to remove the oem user also happens under upstart
no
right , the bug is still open
heh , ok. with the crazy silo crunch we have right now i do n't think i can justify assigning
what 's the purpose of this ? use clonezilla , it 's a bootable iso in itself as well as
why , i 'll just stay with debian or kubuntu 14.10
i mean 200 , not 208 , there
cat -n /etc/apt/sources.list | pastebinit
and modprobe would be ?
yes , know , plymouth is a red-herring , it was me breaking the initramfs in an unfortunate way
what is the output of uname -a
nope . picture time
here it links to a list of releases
cool
does the guest account work ?
but it 's done through firefox awesome bar
nops , let me try to find it
heh : p
nothing after what i stated i installed earlier
so i 'd think it would show them all
you can not open the files in /dev/ directly . its holding the devices and partitions and these needs to
try dpkg -l | grep gparted
are you running 4.0 rc with trusty as a base or vivid ?
how ?
you can even watch a movie from the desktop session i 'd think while installing , but on an ssd
also , i note that bug mentions that touch uses en_us.utf-8 as a default . why ?
can you please do the same for utopic and vivid ?
why do you think that ?
no worries
have you met antonio ? he 'll be there
yes
it 's not a unity8 branch is it ? i just added a silo with your fix
if you open up a terminal and type telnet -- - you get an error about the command not being
studio monitors
if we gathered enough information , despite some errors - > ok , otherwise ... hmmm possibly wrap and return
i 'm really surprised the steam installation package does n't simple declare dependencies so the packages can be installed automatically
did you insert username and password ?
so i would really go with this : )
i bet there 's people that upload things that take eons to build in arm , and that 's why
yes
there , i fixed it for you
i entered the command exactly as you requested adn double-checked
sil2100 : also downforeveryoneorjustme.com shows it as up
oh right : )
i never had to run 'apt-get -f install ' for libc6
what is the output of 'lspci -k|grep -a3 vga ' ?
you can qyery it from the shell making calls to the sqlite api libs
true , that will be all different for sure . but it does not mean that it is worse .
i 've no idea , the log does n't say much
think so . might just be my code is buggy but does n't seem to work . lots of denied
in help i pressed enter held shift
yeah , esp with such low swap space
i assume it is the issue that seb128 just pointed you at so i 'll add some logs there for
no i was n't i said # ubuntu-arm earlier - that message was for another user
are you logged in as the usernow ?
it 's just a pair of wire springs that touch if you step on it
go ahead and merge your payloads branch into master
whats more important ot me is haveing a stable system vs security issues from being behind 2 nats ... ..
i just finally traced it down after about 5 days of debugging , what was happening was i have a
so maybe look at the shifts on the list for those 2-3 packages ? that would make dholbach even happier
ah , the silo is for wily ?
reinstall the flashplugin-installer package , indeed .
includes : [ 'layer : basic ' , 'layer : nodejs ' , 'layer : nginx ' , 'interface :
because it 's erroring when it finishs writing , sais the disk is too small
no problem .
that could be a lot of waste of money
i ran into some other issues though
and that might be the reason it did n't offer me the chance to whitelist your email id
i will ... just puzzled by the side-effect one definition in a supporting class has
alternative would be to run snapcraft in pbuilder environment and have it produce a snap instead of deb
mm i 'm not able to install the package from the ppa , it seems that there was a problem
spinning up a vm takes a few minutes .
... . ...
i 'll try to do that ! tanks in advance ! it 's great that there are guys like you
yeah make sure the pgp key is n't expired ( that 's a good start point xd )
what should i be looking for
not too bad
so why would -ppc be the default instead of -ppc64 ?
please pastebin it .
not as far as i know
oh yeah . you were a little late for that ? now we 're just adding more lines talking about
been a couple of years since i ran unity , but i remember from ccsm with all it 's extras
everytime your use raid without prior planning , a penguin dies . instead of a new cpu , might i
it might be a bamf issue , maybe notshownin onlyshowin would be better to differenciate
^^
the server 's not on any rbls , that 's the first one i checked
can you copy existing qt* packages from s390x into bootstrap archive from xenial-release please ?
there are a few tutorial that i found
i want everything erased and i want kubuntu to have the drive to itself
machine_test.go:1102 :
and that much information is not informative and overloads your ability to get 'security information '
pastebinit /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-unity-greeter.conf
dunno , i do n't live in the us so do n't know about the whacky frequencies used there
maybe i should start looking for another vps hoster , then .
done
ok ... i have some updated libosinfo and virt-manager packages ... but libvirt needs your edk2 packages to detect the
or you can updatw and upgrade in thew konsole/terminal , with : sudo apt update & & sudo apt upgrade
this is about silo 018 that has a fix for the blocker bug of unity8 hanging on boot sometimes ,
fyi , i just did the work for bug # 1440549 . however , i 'm unsure doko got a
speed of writing random data . great tip
did lightdm changed anything on pam ?
very wise choice
i would be more comfortable with the former
generally , auth.log is ( as the name of it says ) for authorizations , as well as usages of
you and i are in agreement
if your resolv.conf is set up correctly , yes ( afair )
also try with ath10k_core and ath10k_pci
no !
for the other one , i do n't really know what 's going on , you should check with doko
if you look at /var/log/apt/history.log , can you see what was removed this morning ?
discovery of other oses is done by os-prober , which is called by grub 's /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober script .
i said , remove mp3 support from your equation by not using an mp3 to test if you audio is
rather hal than skynet though right : )
well whilst your word i do n't disbelieve , they 're different kernels - so there 's no point trying
second question , use / in less . search not supported in more afaik
what connection are you on
the package in there is one of the ones that are hard to install though
and that did n't work either ( look at the $ secret snap in $ secret project )
some channels require you to do something to be able to speak .
great ... i hope you solved it !
it should n't be an app thing , it should be a content hub thing .
if photorec cant recover , data is really gone
is there an assertnotraises ?
i sent the email
i got this error , so i tried removing the .juju/environments/amazon.jenv
why ?
no tty2 , or no consoles at all ?
but all my faul , once the fixes above land we should be good again
morn o/
so like a driver enclosure ?
there are a lot of patches in the drivers/acpi/ sub-tree , over 300 between v3.19..v4.2 for example
yup , it 's gross , but we know we do n't pulse more than every 5m ( realistically ,
that 's not a support question
`` ldd /path/to/binary '' will tell you the paths to all the linked libraries
whats the replacement for it ?
and , in principle , i 'm okay with removing ppc go binaries to get past this , *but* the
as it stands , my pr can be relocated easily
why are you telling me that ?
hmm interesting , the proxies were resolved and were working during bootstrapping - update was able to resolve the ubuntu
it 's still running i can see my other connection in irc
ok
ack , ty
do you have more details about this ? ( e.g . is it already confirmed that it will come but
what is the output of `` sudo service uplink start '' ?
i was close to breaking my laptop this morning
it might still be the router.. hehe . lots of fun places for a firewall to live . ; )
sudo /usr/share/apport/whoopsie-upload-all
yeah , transitioned rdeps do n't *need* to happen before vivid releases , but it would be nice .
.canonical
remember , anyway , that you can use the binary from its folder ... you do n't nedd always the
i 'm assuming the ext4 one has to be set to primary and not logical
yeah , that 's one of the howtos i read . i 've done this more than once in the
silo 12 passed verification but did n't land
would you have time for a call , say , in 10-15 mins ?
yeah , the bane of my life .
^
get off my lawn with your deckchair
yep , there 's a couple of places that use that conversion code that would need changing
no
ericsnow : i know what date to put as well , i just do n't get the last charas ?
ok , confirmed after restart the modules are loaded
well , i did n't know that
it 's dual boot with windows yea
i 'm working on getting a couple more people on the team , then we might get to go back
it seems seeded ?
i use a few lenovo
shrug , ignore me
it looks like the launcher is unconditionally applying the devices cgroup
short answer is you should use the client api
and , yes , naming something `` smart '' is basically cursing it with an eternal suck magnet
enough trolling now , you have been pointed towards solutions already
needs a core dev to publish
try the guest account and see if it works first
no , i 've heard nobody else experience that
xfce can run on more than just ubuntu
did you add that ?
enjoy !
plus async calls and threads == lots of crap
correct , you 've got me there
did you use ppapurge ?
cya then
we 've got a todo to add a default layout algo to the svg generator
which version of ubuntu are you using ?
just synced mirrors now , so going to give in some time to settle . maybe a couple of hours
this works fine for me : e.g . `` find /usr/share/doc/ -type f -name '*.html ' -execdir grep -l 'dtd
ok , can you follow up with them on irc outside of the meeting ?
maybe the # kubuntu guys can assist better ?
check if other processes are also eating up memory , forcing mysqld out possibly
what did i do ? : )
i 'm listening : )
no , sata is type of connection , raid is how to disttibute the content ( stripe/mirror )
okay , what 's going on ?
might be some weird interaction with overlayfs ?
possibly . but i have tried to use the existing flavours as a guide .
so what you 're saying is `` the internet '' forgot what that file was and it does not exist
so do i , and it gets hotter on apps that use the gps radio than games
i have booted to the bios by pressing the correct buttons and turned off secure boot but it still is
indeed . and it 's on windows and os x too . so why not on gnu/linux or the likes
i actually logged one last night that ended up being a dup of it ... .basically , if i went
hmm , i havent gotten that working with out normal container yet ... is it suppoed to work ?
anything jack seems to block all audio so ...
is what you posted something you just made , or did you paste it from one of your working projects
ok , nvm that , that was a chroot issue
wow nice list
not `` in firefox ''
which upstart is running there ?
no look it up online
i found what i was looking for , i looking for the command to add another channel using webchat client
credit to you , if that 's the one .
have a nice day : )
i looked to the bottom of multiple listts ... and books and magazines and found nothing
so whats tehe actual problem ?
sure . reading through your comments now
ok , press ctrl+shift+v now
at the bottom
no i mean does it have a potential to crash
so him disabling ondemand will cause it to use full power consumption ? but reduce his heat ?
does that give you some feedback
can other users in the same group edit the same file ?
this computer is mint , but my disks issue is using ubuntu server .
: ) i love the idea of snappy console / repl / cli /shell and being able to interact with
ask mintsupport
look behind you , a three-headed monkey !
qa passed it but your mr is not approved
well , it does work , but we also hear alot about a variety of bugs that come and go
a cronjob ...
well , it 's up & ready to-go !
pointless .
keep ubuntu-ing !
did that problem survive reboot ?
we still celebrate columbus day because we like mattress sales
um dunno depends where it installed to
from the client-side api proxy ?
ah , ack : - ) second , prob dumb q , landing for the devices ( i.e . overlay
might give it a try , dont like to install additional software just for one time use
can you tell me a little bit more about exactly what was failing and for how long , and how
marked your branch as approved , and rejected mardy 's
and i 'd say we want a dmesg and lsusb at a minimum from the broken state
on it
i have n't tried either , i just copied what you told aquarius to use
ok
great ! you like it ?
yes , but it is not a replacement for chkdsk ( and in fact will schedule a chkdsk on the
about currywurst ? ; - )
the only reliable mapping is the packages file .
just rebuilt
at least it is doing something : )
beheading close to lyon
i do n't think they would , unless either is buggy enough to crash
not that i know of , but would be a good idea to create one
is /dev/sdb the disk you 're trying to rescue ?
qdebug : components : : alarmmodelstresstest : : cleanuptestcase ( ) ( ucalarmmodel.cpp:217 , ucalarmmodel : : get ) -
looks good to me
did you install kernel 3.19 on ubuntu 14.04 ?
what happens when you try to use sysrq magic to cleanly unount and reboot ?
video disk recorder
from a changes perspective , 1.10.x is cut from 1.9.x
that 's coming in via lttng headers that qtmir includes . looking to see where that symbol might have gone
when using kmix with alsa it exposes all the channels
you tried to mount a vfat disk on your ubuntu with all permissions like windows do ?
no
those are more acurate instructions
1. run `` crontab -e ''
if we do n't read from stdin and pass it in with the req , and instead set up the
top of the window , if you are on 15.04 top bar if you are on anything older , if
but there 's been noise about shrinking p8 and p9 for more specialised uses , so never say never .
yeah just old
you ca n't identify because of the proxy ?
should strip out all the formatting
you got grub and booted into ubuntu , and it was running the 3.19 kernel ?
which web design tools do you currently use on windows ?
do n't worry about it *until* you need that break : )
but the mouse pointer stays the same when changing the mouse icons
is htere something wrong with ppc64el/armhf testing atm ? i seem to have no results for dkms packages for wily
on wily o xenial ?
possibly , but you do n't know what i 'm going to ask next : )
no
who and when released this 1.126.1 ubuntu-sdk in trusty ?
i guess we can get mirv to do it in the morning , since he 's the qt person ?
it seems unresponsive
or do a test run first
all righty . and logical v. primary partitiions are n't too important right ?
it just is n't 'intelligent ' enough to do it correctly all the time
ah i see , primary is fine for both swap and /
how big is that file ?
what do those settings i mentioned report ?
yeah , software patents make everything painful : (
the libjson errors as i said before aree not errors that would give the kernel panic
try going back to the homepage and logging in again .
tnx
this is a support channel , please do n't use it as a test channel for your bot
what version of ubuntu are you running currently ?
then why on earth are you using old raring ppa ?
thx
turnaround is much worse for the first time ever signing the thing too .
ok let me try again
no , use it selectively to make the common tasks easier
no we do n't have to
before that the login-manager did n't even start
ooi , why reassign in this case ?
it doesnt i 've tried every port
why do n't you use filezilla ?
yes .
what tedg demo 'd was a c++ app
\o/
yes , and then we 'll change the uri
so that is a bug with file manager actually
what did you type exactly ?
ok it 's using the graphics driver
wow that 's pretty cool . do n't have an account but will create one now : )
that was sentences though , because some of us actually care enough to type in full sentences : )
you 'll find that ( and other packages conf files ) with `` ll /var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-php5 . * ''
i updated the ticket , can you publish again ?
look at `` aplay -l '' results now ; you 'll probably find that 's due to a new device
i 'll have a look at it
did you do bzr up ?
generic-amd64/stable should work
i used your formatting and it still working
please do n't post multiple times : )
yes , and ?
it 's showing you that it got an empty slice of *syslog.writer but it expected a length of 2
this is why it 's broken - you can ask them to fix their distro .
yes in console
ok ... that tells us the system bios is likely calling the adapter 's pnp ( plug and play )
for example to enable hw virtualization
both ugly , but i can do some sort of sync and wait
the errors you 're getting seem to be connectivity issues . are you sure the machine you 're on has
be sure to add sudo -u /bin/bash if you want it to start up as another user .
please run the the following command , which should give you a pastebin link : ( set -x ; for
no such libcgid found on any linux
so follow their removal instructions , in future use the ubuntu partner repos for that
you saw the list of shortcuts , right ?
but it is command line based right ?
we will soon be driven by google automatic cars
how ?
no , i have applied acl for the directories and files inside that depends on the user previliges
also , do you have a miezu too ?
ril ?
i 'm using os x on my laptop , so less hassle to just run it from the server
yw ! indeed , i guess those kind of crashs are the only way to motivate changing things that basically
hm , weird . i wanted to update that patch a bit anyway . i 'll have a look later
it uses xapian and a helper python service exposed by u-s-c to get some extra data
well , it 's not a `` uri '' per se , it 's a hack : - )
that assumes you 're using gstreamer , btw
hi
ready for wednesday ?
but i thought you said xfce ? : o
mind you , i still hold onto a 12mb harddrive .
not a bad idea
yeah it 's not default
i suppose # kubuntu-devel could give dpme guidance about your request
i installed the system . i help them to get away from windows . thats terrible . i am so
so do you have a constructive to add or is it just ranting and flaming ?
there are bandwith monitors out there for ubuntu , but as ben64 sugested wireshark is pretty effective
can you log in as any other user ?
and maybe 30_uefi-firmware 40_custom
you can set the block size
yes , as someone could hack its .desktop files ... or chromium web-apps does that
track what ? codesearch.debian.org is useful
how do i change those ?
do you have a recipe to trigger the fatwrite issue ?
is the new volume applet available in 15.10 via update ?
in the manual -b specifies the block size , where -c changes the parrallel reads . by default it 's
any time we execute user code we do it in a hook context , do n't we ?
do you know how to apply text diffs ( patches ) using the 'patch ' tool ?
windows install what not connected when i installed , it is on different drive
phone must have developer mode enabled too
any errors on crash ?
`` sudo adduser $ user vboxusers ``
ok , complete questions in future please
it broke at 0.2
done
nm , compiz
option 2 is to get a sixxs ipv6 tunnel , then only allow ipv6 connections
i 've back ported lightdm-gtk-greeter to the ubuntu mate 14.04 ppa . hence the reference to 14.04 .
can you read the files stored on the raid ?
interesting i have it passing in xenial and failing in vivid+o : d
if you are interested in receiving notifications of that card just drag your avatar in there
it is , and it isnt
unity 's app-switcher was also affected ... being very slow and sluggish to respond to a first invocation
i didnt try live session from usb
windows and android only can show one desktop , also no multible windows at the same time . i thought
it would need some folks to step up and organize it
we usually only do such a meeting once shortly after release to talk about the next one
turn on developer mode if you have n't
hidden like 'cant ls and cant read ' ? just make it chown -r gentool2 : gentool2 ( or whatever
i see the pid
please , find another method of support .
ping
is each app going to be a seperate test suite in checkbox ?
mini.iso
but npm feels rather fragile from my little xp with it
nope .
`` darthdeus ''
ok , cause vivid has some qtorganizer5-eds changes that rtm does not , but does n't sound like it fixes
i click on it but when i go again there nothing happens
my thought exactly
yes , debdiff is fine for gdm
they kinda forced it upon us , but i switched to german 'cause i found it way easier : p
btw you said something about not calling alarm.reset ( ) and alarm.cancel ( ) on the same alarm object ?
i , uhm , completely missed this c & d ...
so i guess you do n't really have a nouveau driver
after the telnet , send get .
i installed alien , but what is this : sudo apt-get install alien
yeah , and runlevels 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 are mapped to the same result .
it 's automatic , there is a bot for that : )
tl ; dr : that silo got deleted so i had to rebuild it
it wo n't be in usa stores
if you get a web accessible system with the same release of ubuntu then install wine as usual . you
checked it is there trying to enable but getting disabled
better yet , drop apple and get nexus/android .
ok and for the third time now - do you have an ip ? : )
not good
ubuntu 15.04 n\ l\ , no actionparsnip
*.desktop ! = .desktop ?
which email ? ? ?
after all , if it had n't been an error , we would n't have discovered this potential test cross-talk
larsu , willcooke : good morning , btw : )
it 's really `` friday 13th '' it seems for some of you : )
expecting design , that 's crazy talk ; - )
deploying to a space with no subnets will raise an error ( needs adding to the doc )
hmm kde is kde , mint or else , a few things differ a little , usually on the settings
with an updated version
can you show me the code for the oxide api ?
sent you the updated patch via mail
ok lets immigrate to africa and play ubuntu circle : p
is 404 unless i log in
he just likes to confuse people
2019
single booting lts 14.04
yeah its pretty swish now : )
yeah that 's a common scenario i believe . i 've set up a dual boot myself just this week
( uploaded to debian now , can be synced later )
can you ssh into it ?
sil2100 : i guess i have fixed it ...
why give someone a cli solution , if they do n't know how to find packages it hints at their
it always depend if the sponsor is already identified ( as it is in the current case )
i 'll remember to grep through / whenever i drop a dependency next time : p
15.04
i do have an existing patch for 0.9.8 that should apply just fine .
do you know of any contact in terms of negotiating getting the latest broadcom driver compiled ? apparently the trusty
yep
cat /var/log/xorg.0.log | nc termbin.com 9999
do n't use wubi for starters
because openvpn will only route my ipv4 address and my ipv6 is still public . i ca n't find a
even if you do n't ( and i had already said ship it : ) )
i do n't really understand the current situation . it seems quite complicated .
you could just as well call it typehandleroptions
did you get everything sorted out ?
ah yeah
it is a linux tool to help computers boot off of usb and other devices even when the computer does
done
i wanted to migrate it to a properly maintained channel but then slangasek recommended to do it more properly ,
oh tnx !
yeah figured he was eod since he 's not in the channel
you still have the install media ? would be worth checksumming it and verifying the hash from wherever you downloaded
dep ?
what process are you trying to use as user subsonic ?
nope
what video card ?
right !
nah , the dir actually has a space in it
and , thats what im asking.. *is* that what you set it to ?
it 'll take awhile to build . should be done when you start tomorrow
you could n't get it to boot from the device ?
you mean hotspot ?
system-wide or for a user ?
np
look at them , probably all a different mac-address fields
i am not user . but looking at the fail : in the tests , these are very different from
works on mine .
what 's the command to join # windows ? im not familiar with irc
introduce yourself , and paste lp & wiki link please : )
what i mean
dpkg -p libgcrypt11
sniper ghost warrior
obviously in chrome
depends on your gfx card and driver used
so what will fn key do for me ?
i alreayd just complained in irc , what more can i do ?
yeah , the only thing is that none of these functions actually show up in the kernel trace . but
sarnold : oh yeah , there 's some utf-8 too
you have *no* scrollbars ?
lspci to list devices and ifconfig to list network configuration
graphics card and driver ?
consider tweaking the # of workers to cut the memory footprint
using cloud resources ?
but i 'm not crazy , am i ? that was gone inbetween ...
also map-ordering milestone is 1.24 which is currnt trunk so no backporting is required : d
rai.it ?
okay yeah i spelled that wrong anyhow
ok
lol
i was just connecting the numbers from the backlog in here : )
you 're late , i did that fo
oh sorry i see i nee to do update , upgrade , dist-upgrade
: )
it works ... i have full screen on the 1900 monitor ( lappy is 1440 ) it 's all good
great !
oh , my bad .
photorec from testdisk yes
try this , universal diff format is a little easier to read . ( that said , i do n't
you mean runsupernotsupported ? it only has been a convenience helper for run
^^^
scroll up with pageup and check if it finished or gave an error or ..
yes , i just unpacked it and looked at imported/invoke-rc.d
that suggests your entire system has problems of some sort ... possibly corrupted shared libraries
well aptcache download packagename makes a .deb to your /home right
nice idea . the door would n't close on the cabinet though
all good , no ( major ) complaints
give me 5 mins and i 'll connect my laptop to my tv via hdmi to see what happens
the other thing , is of course to make sure you do adb wait-for-device after installing , before using phablet-config
linux used to have this too , but the age of the `` modern '' window manager has eliminated those
why i do n't think there 's anything else . a shorter route to the same thing would be somemachine.tag
well , they worked on the second try , so `` yes '' .
wan na hangout ?
file a bug , and maybe ask attente if you can catch him in one of the ubuntu channels
i see that we also have 'click_scope_item ' in genericscopeview too : - )
what does n't work ? making the link , or running it ?
right , any interesting logging ?
this card runs my acer uhd monitor at 4k 60hz without problem ... only this lg tv results in problems
i havent checked on another system . i have changed my internal hdd to an ssd , installed ubuntu ,
it uses wget if i recall , so it should continue where it leaves off ?
it 's okay : )
hey
ok
not that i 'm aware of
right , execstart { pre , post } must not start anything long-running
ok , cool , running it now
depends on the license
in a chroot update-grub yes
first , i thought we 'd want rpi upstream to maintain , then i thought pes would maintain
sorry , i thought it was still running ops
so i see
files on the usb disk are ok ( i 've checked the md5sum.txt )
that should work , does the file exist after reboot
you can send out your e-mail to kubuntu devel if you like so it 's not wasted effort : )
so i would n't focus too much on things beyond january at this point , but i 'd also note
yes ; )
last time i checked it could not build stuff on centos and sles : - )
do you get : panic : osversion reported an error
^
i mean , the 'main menu ' ?
laney : i know what 's going on with the failed package install under pinning ; i have a fix
does the desktop file still support x-canonical-sidestage key ? that 's what i remember seeing in the old clock app
out of curiosity , do you know if this is a uefi machine ...
yes it takes in the password goes black and am back to login screen again
kubuntu and ubuntu studio should be pretty much be the same when it comes to audio . though jackd might
ok , i doubt its happening for 3.16
as i said i do n't need networking at all c :
so still unable to boot ?
saviq : qt 5.4.1 silo would be ready to go ( to qa testing ) aside from this unity8 issue
some iptables scripts
so eg bullet has red xs on all arches but when i click through to the log it 's all
if i only knew how to do that on the livefs builder : )
do you have virbr0 on your machine ?
too true
if you did n't have a : at the end no
yep
( ./indicator-keyboard-tests:17755 ) : glib-critical ** : g_variant_get_type : assertion 'value ! = null ' failed
where ?
true . i ignored the change apt sources step as it may be risky to dist-upgrade there but indeed it
lgtm , if you mark the last issue resolved , then you have the shipit from axw
they have to define the exec statement
nice : )
that sohuld alreayd happen via debconf
mount your /boot somewhere and run 'sudo grub-install -- boot-directory= < point where you mounted /boot > /dev/hdb
it seems like the drivers are loaded appropriately on install
i meant database as a generic term for a named database - the point was the _dev was appended to
i would need a screenshot . i ca n't read your mind where you are at and what you are
that looks good . have you tested it on unity8 itself to see how it looks in the app scope
i am being obtuse again ... i do not know how to do that
well , a better readme would be my guess
no
yes looks like , i will try to find a solution
honestly i wanted to do some work on the core apps to get a feel as to what would be
so i must be missing something
exactly , or else peergrouper will just keep updating the agent.cof
none of those appear to be usb . is this an older laptop ?
but it does make us use less python2 -- not every ubuntu install is a deja-dup desktop
so i dont need any extra packages in order to start developing for kde on kubuntu ?
i have n't tested with an android .
is there any debug output for media-hub that would help you make sure this code is truly in there ?
: )
so wont take long before an rip reaches underground : p
: )
when you get to the live session after selecting french should it be in french ?
np
so i mean the former
haha 15.04 , which is actually what i recommend , easiest way to fix problem with compatibility is to try
you do n't change directory
ssh in , run screen ( look at the docs for how to use it ) and win !
that 'd explain it not working then : ) install it , then check it runs with `` service ssh
both the wireless button and the network manager insist that wireless is disabled . it 's still doing it .
opensuse and suse enterprise use it as default now .
you can also stick on lts for more stable enviroment

what version of maas are you using , incidentally ?
what do you need ? i can check jolla store
keyboard pairing is not yet supported in rtm

you can have up to 4 primary partitions , and up to 16 logical partitions in an extended partition ,
you can just copy the entry and change deb to deb-src , apt-get update and then do the build-dep
what error ?
that 's 53 characters ; i 'd expect it to have an even number
added you
do you use light-locker ?
i ca n't remember the exact item it should be , but it should not be unity8
no , it does n't work directly in system-settings either
when the temp scope closes , the scope that opened the temp scope closes the temp scope

once we have qtbase in , i 'll spend some time binnmu the lots until -proposed is happy .
that one i can handle ... i almost made the sdk testing with that

did you find out about migrate -- list already ?
i 'm uploading my crash now .
ok
take it anyway you want . please stop now
i can do it then - no changes needed ?
thx
yeah should be fine a sis ; i 'll take the patch as is now unless you are dying to
i use aliases and all no password in the sudoer file , however i do n't recommend it to anyone
yes
i 'd be memtesting or checking smart disk health personally
looks ?
on the one hand , `` it 's just a debugging tool '' makes a good argument for updating it

but ca n't search now , working at a client atm

( i 'm failing to find a link now but ) i understand this is best practice where __init__ only
can you show me a screenshot of the add window ?
right , that 's wily
and extractsnap for the gadget as that has all the information on how to setup partitions , which snaps to
ahhh , nice
can you execute the busybox that was extracted under /tmp/ ... by my script ?
type ifconfig | nc termbin.com 9999 on that pc
that is expected behavior
is 5.2 branched yet ?
/media is tricky sometimes . ive had permission issues in the past . is there anyway you can move the
apt-get update -- fix-missing
about my patch ... yeah , it only clears the colors under the scorllbar
i 've compared our package with debian 's and it 's ok to sync , assuming the version issue is
it 's just openjdk atm
or , you can try get the meta json file , get the image files with stable downloader and move
or pastebin what i asked ... the output of `` dpkg -l | grep nvidia ''
why not test it out in a vm first before committing ?
so when it was built qt 5.5 was still in -proposed and the oxide did not get built against it
you might need the eol-update trick with 'old-releases
this seems to be a userspace crash , but it is shown with old and new userpace , and only
not on my machine , so installing with apt-get install ubiquity
that is very cold ...
well ! : ) .
depends on your needs
why did n't you snatch the one from the xubuntu page while you were at it ? : p
type update-grub
cron runs on a schedule , not at startup
other file-systems may not have that online resize support
i dont understand what that has to do with the tuner
alright , a mess of node-* building in ppa : adconrad/ppa , we 'll see how that looks .
sure , what for
the lack of proper gui tools for some tasks
only if it works
alright , i suspect the repo i suggested does not have drivers supporting prime then : ( did you purge
no
like this basically w8 install , did not know uefi install scenario , advised to do a reinstall using same
but remixes are normally more about remixing the user applications/desktop environments/languages rather than hardware support
why this is an bad idea ?
you missing the repo key ?
how are you ?
there is , but deployment is a few steps becuase you have to run the dev version of the charm
is it a known problem ?
i do not know how should i do that . : (
what happens if you run top ? i see unity8 using ~90 % and ms2 using ~90 %
yes out of stock it says now
it happened on the kvm long time ago .
reaver ? let us know the issues for help .
ah , ty

the horizon height is imho critical .
i am well and as usual still causing trouble for arosales

sugarcrm 7.5 requires it
hey , welcome back . when you 're caught up , ping me
please do n't swear
so , i am wondering if i go to ext4 and supported qemu is ok , or if you want
indeed . but imo it 'd be far cooler than the current set-up where we 're just stalking our own
ppa 's are on own risk mate
it 's approved now
let me have a look - probably
now do `` udisksctl info /dev/sdb ''
the requested width/height ? am guess the qsize is the returned
that 's the edge4k campaign , hush !
ok then , can you please let me know the mp links , i 'll add to the silo and

do you use vlans , `` strange '' protocols or ipv6 ?
for what ati card ?
yes you can !

as it might still be a str or bytes ( if there 's some garbage in the log )
i do n't think there is need for graphics drivers for the integrated intel ones .
ok , i did n't know if you had permissions for that or not
or if you can just get the screenshot of that timeout or machine check
unity tweak tool can be used for window animations etc .
how have you been ?
i was thinking we could use the same mode
yeah , i wish snappy would n't change the entire fhs , but right now we ca n't have /opt
could n't hurt . i 'd personally only go to 14.04
usaully 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.0
the manual way is not really a solution . we just mentioned this since you were annoying in asking that
ok this is not my situation i just wan na know , but why should i distribute its source too
it 's not bad apart from that
how is your installation going ?
yes and no
i did that one string and then noticed you were on it , so i stopped again ; )
but it 's not on the personnal desktop image ?
oh totallly different then , see above
hey , on your mp , i ca n't see any usage of the classes in ofono_helper , are they

everything that went wrong for me happened on my first install after i tried to install some beta drivers from

this nvidia issue you 've got - does the machine use that optimus ?
yeah , install frameworks packages from vivid-proposed
abeato , jgdx : i 'll start working on a fix right now

maybe use a hexeditor ?
oh ... are you 12.04 ?
please keep the chatter at # xubuntu-offtopic

you have lots of 3rd party software in there and you have some precise repos in there
did you see my ping yesterday about some tasks we might have
either the var is not protected or we got nothing with md5sum
i assume we do not have the ability to publish though , right ?
could n't find a matching case there . i 'd like to try some more before i file a bug

that 's the weird thing there is n't much showing up anywhere

ok. than dont ask again if you dont even read the answers
no , make /boot a 1g
and use qscopedpointer < ucstyleditembaseprivate > d_ptr
it gives me a >
i see . how can i find which program start these process
hi ! i do n't quite follow . the lte check is unchecked and can not be checked ?
comes handy on headshots : p
which current state ?
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
maas provider ?
it hit the race where releases is downloaded before the dists switch and packages after .
local is 15.10 , remote 14.04
bon apetit : p
^ [ 22:51 ] < frecel > valorie : i have some experience developing with qt qml , i 'm
so you think if i install kvm everything should work fine ?
yeah windows first is preferable . do you have anything you need from ubuntu backed up already ? and you
that 's the one of last week yes ?
, once that 's finished , sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
# ubuntu-phone should redirect here
and they let you out of the dealership without a new one ?
if you type samba in the dash nothing shows up ?
if you run `` dmesg | grep -i ata '' and see if there are lots of errors mentioned ,
thats what you were told in # bash
yes , but can you try f1 at the boot of your usb to enter more options
so , how about just returning self.signals ? then let the calling code check how many records there are etc
welcome
pitty may know a better way though
thats gon na take some time i have to download and flash the iso
time too short ( my aprox should have been < 5s )
how would i go about that ? dmesg ?
no , i am not fully sure about the steps . did you update the wiki ?
no
this is why i have two drives .
ok , ty , bbiab and i will ping you
i meant , i 've heard good things about midori , but i never tried it
it 's not working , and i do n't have control over frequencies with indicator-cpufreq
i 've tried that repeatedly . but i 'll do so again if it helps
if you flash with an image that has here maps enabled it runs
is this a charm/bundle you have written yourself
well , but the root directory is in an encrypted luks volume , and when the default boot has failed
uh sorry , i do n't remember ; is there a bug report for this ? ( always better to
how do i remove that ppa ?
on that subject ; are you aware of the very recent patches for btfrs shadow volume corruption ?
lol nope i do n't think so x :
yes , 16.04 ( next lts release ) is schedled for april 2016 .
is there some reason we ca n't just make it a list of arguments ? that seems like the most
nope that does n't have a `` ? '' : )
does your router have internet access ?
im aware
got it - nw
i 'll check
looking
yes . protocol violation here
yes i 'll add 2 more disks
do we have a newer distro-info and debootstrap already ?
suffice to say mir already has code that replaces what freon does . and that drm platform in mir we
sometimes it 's fine and sometimes it screws me . i never really now which it 'll end up being
type lsmod | grep dm-mod
rvm help install ?
from windows to windows ?
if we can go through the manual testing and it passes , then sure .
i 've not used lmms enough to advise . suggest you consult # opensourcemusicians
it 's due to some new stuff that ian added
ok , that 's good to know
ok , so the idea is that the dir exists via the `` click '' package ?
yes . gfile is only a url
there is only two files in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled ?
so the idea is to force a drive out after x amount of time and replace with a new drive
dbarth : sure , on it now
that 's an independent decision ; but i hear snappy/server team etc . are looking at networkd
you do remember the wild west that was srus before we made the process slow , right ?
explains why i wouldnt boot then : p
open them and look at the content
i blame that nov 13 was a friday , hence the world broke = )
lvm supports snapshots . you can create a snapshot using that .
on my end that 's the auto-import and the gadget snap list plugin
i guess pressing the power button turns the screen off , right ?
i dont see how a poll will safe you from that .
the first time it works . but from the second time onwards it does not
xvfbtestnotifications
i 'll give you a moment to recover ; p
haha , /fingers crossed i did n't break anything
please stop that attitude .
get to bed ! it 's 4:15 ! ; d
spoiler- you 're already using old code .
yeh , i 've noticed : /
11pm
oh really ? that is a bummer .
that 's good . use that and i would recommend the wheezy to jessie upgrade path , that image is

on reboot i got ** ( process:2128 ) : critical ** : bluez.vala:104 : error calling startservicebyname for org.bluez :
its not a matter of data size , its the matter of downloading from a known source
so on /r/ubuntu , your `` future roadmap for ubuntu '' was said to clearly show that the merge of
exactly
ok
what is the output of lspci | grep vga
is your system uefi ?
ok , i 'll review whatever data we can get
how do i check that ? the phone did say stuff like `` transfering '' and stuff like that after
got it . easy to bump . but also ... let 's just land no-touch-no-lifecycle ...
it 's an issue i created while trying to add a usr/bin directory - in order to run an irssi
what specifically ? i 've already has dslstats running , and the hacked webui shows most of this info i
any interface you configure manually , network manager will stay away from to avoid doing something you do n't want
i install openssh-server it is going broken
ack
i see what you did there . ; )
yeah , my experience with the github world has been pretty rough .
oooh , that 's a nice idea
sorry.. i do n't exactly follow what you mean . i 'm a novice user.. can you tell me what
ah ok , if the bios option does n't seem obvious - i 'd try pulling the graphics card out
in ubuntu 14.10 i can alt+tab .. and wait 3 sec to show all windows
hey there ! i was working with lazypower on the mariadb charm
and the fact that it 's never built in the past makes it a bit of a `` who cares
i have time on my hands today .
awesome ?
he said that on the mr
yeah , sorry ... i did n't see the packages coming to the ppa and i was worried : -d.
yeah , it 's kind of cool to see people still rocking the amiga / beos
2 minutes - my rice is ready !
and the translations are probably already in your trunk . so you really just need the changelog and that one
yeah , best to grab their own bootable image , it 's great .
i am a windows tech by trade , trying to learn me some linux ... i 've learned the hard
krillin . shall i also check mako ?
this is a discussion for elsewhere , imo
type additional drivers
if hardware is the issue , we can organize funding from the canonical community fund , or our fund if
just a greeting ... or would you prefer good $ daytime ?
good stuff
that all sounds sane to me , but let 's add it to the bug and ask dosaboy how does
did you try other browser ?
hard disk or filesystem corruption ?
it would be 111 to 121 , right ?
what directory are you in ?
undo all that .
10.04 is eol . so dont expect people or ubuntu to support it .
/boot/config- < kernel name > is where the config is in ubuntu
well , that is another bug i found perviously
so that 's full alright . where did that 32gb come from ?
okay so you can try nomodeset boot parameter for the kernel to have it use the default graphics drivers instead
another silly ... have you left a dvd/cd on the dvd drive ?
i do n't think so
jam , but is still somehow useful
different adresses than the traditional ones for update security etc
network related question if you have a moment
right but that 's not *registration* thats *extraction*
i ca n't remember which side you were on about states being specific to each resolver ( who is on
that 's not what 's happening here
grub_terminal=console is commented ?
$ $ anything-between-two-dollar-signs $ $
sourcery . nothing good will come of it , i assure you .
uefi is the windows install model , as of w8 .
hrm . no blinking lights : )
sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get dist-upgrade & & sudo do-release-upgrade
you created a snap by following the tutorial and doing `` snappy build . ''
intel graphics should be configured with the correct driver by default , do you have issues with other video playing
ok i 'll set it up . there 's some magic
i do n't
i am using static ip
so run dist-upgrade then sit back and relax ? i do n't see what the problem is .
if you want a `` stable '' os , use the supported packages , until you find you need something
yes , which , now that i know where this error originates from , i know why it 's not
yes
let me try publishing
that is unity-system-compositor 's socket , set in its upstart job
are you using qemu to run docker/owncloud as well ?

not with a path that probably wo n't exist for most people

its a script that starts vncserver

spanish occurs to me a bit badly maintained anyway
does that sound like a reasonable change - unitservice not panicing - but returning an error if the unit name
ok , you can chroot from there and install grub
just sayin : d
firefox 36.0.1+build2-0ubuntu1
your just posted a bug about kde .
cam , music , videos ... nothing more atm until there is better framework integration for sds
right , that 's more or less been my conclusion when looking at this in the past . : -/
apart from the fact , as you say , the scripts should not run
with my respect the hurdles that you 've been tripping up on so far show that this is a great
kgunn , ok , it appears to be in the overlay ppa now
and you still have the ubuntu installation usb ? ?
it 's not exactly plug and play : )

is that the list posted in scottk 's blog ?
or should i switch to a hybrid approach ( which i like but is admittedly slightly janky ) ?
: d
did you try all recommended syntaxes in the replies ?
ah , you see a crash gui , have you looked at it ?
i would n't be massively surprised by that , depending on your resources/i-o
please go back and draft the full picture before asking funny questions out of context
ok , try `` pastebinit /var/log/xorg.0.log ''
nothing , if it does what you want , and all that information , that is specific to your scenario
no , x64 is 64 bit
i ve installed the executable file via wine
will do so
rsalveti : should be in next image , just apt-get install it
you can do most of the things without the ide , it is just a bit more difficult . but
unless there 's a way i can add files ?
hopefully : ) the 3.19 kernel makes the surface pro 2 freeze . the solution seems to be to downgrade

about having .fetch_archives tell me what it downloaded
i was thinking i wanted to say `` not to unconfined and not to a profile that starts with '/
sudo systemctl restart network
i have kubuntu installed in french . in the tty 's the french accents do not appear
no but you can make any user you make an admin , the account made at install is admin .
cause then all of us have to field bug reports from people `` trying dracut '' and booting slightly differently
in that case , you would have made life a little easier if you resized windows from inside windows already
i provided answers and assigned it back to you .
ok just one min
what channel is your router transmitting on within the 2.4 , and 5ghz ?
and it *could* be done without destabilising the lts , with a careful backported compiler with a different name and
you feel like trying to fix the ubiquity bug ? i can make a task for it ; )
locate and remove
do you have an /etc/urfkill - and if so what is it 's contents ?

ahhh , you mean , redo the manual alteration for kernel updates ? yes ... until i can get a

so the issue is probably that we are thinking 10.0.6 . * is the right address , when really the
you mean it should rotate so that it 's facing towards the enemy it shoots ?
yeah true
ok , so not worth investigating
i got the same message : )
was there anything else that obviously needed addressing ?
if you could put the example in a branch that is easy to run , it should make for a

i 'll bookmark that
i tried it but the paquet is not found
what is werid is that only one is failing ?
now it is , aborting your 025 build and rerunning
you could have a pure ubuntu up and running in 30 minutes , the longest part would just be moving
ah sorry that was n't clear . let me know if there 's any information that you ca n't get
but ... that antenna works with the tv i mentioned , right ? and then i get many channels for

type sudo blkid /dev/sda1
there is # midori : )
great ! cheers : )
yes , update the packages in the silo with a fix , and i 'll continue testing when it 's
its not a hardware thing , i was able to do so when i was using windows
maybe they can help you on your issues and its easier to communicate with them
how very divisive !
i target lts codebases typically
ouch .
nothing fancy , no .
vg then lets get it
let 's try easy first .
: d
you 'll need someone to have done a `` port '' of ubuntu touch for the device
yea but anticipation : )
i broke your code and defintely could use a bit of guidance fixing it
no problem , i can re-rebase onto the old known good version of charm.v6 for now
any output ?
it needed permissions to access the folders
it 's shipping in all latest images
but they are needed for your enlightenment program
do you have a log ?
same message
checkbox , i fixed checkbox to not be crazy .
make your push helper use the networking policy , and have it manually reviewed
yeah that just pushed in
i 'm using vim on the script , but with whatever text editor you are comfortable with , edit the

let me check .
right but the goal is to enable them in the indicator
any pointers as to what sites/repositories/lists to follow to keep in the loop on these developments ?
how do you handle the `` cross '' part in that ?
run it as the user , type */5 * * * * < user > sh blabla/script.sh
k , so i added that persistent option , was n't very hard ...
so your doing , fastboot flash recovery recovery.img - fastboot reboot recovery.img . ?
or you store all the mail inside /var/vmail/ and do sorting there
you were backporting 5.3.2 right ?
should i reboot ?
well , no offense , but i 'm sure once we have a hundred million users , a page on
yeah , there was that update yesterday ^
32-bit
aw , that 's the `` i 'll give you a machine on a random network '' type of joyent
oh , didrocks said that . : p
no
those are needed during provisioning
let 's enable and run them
but it 's still weird that a impacts b , is n't it ?
ubuntu 14.04 ssd kingstone
alternatively , you can use a mock watcher of course
ideally if you do n't know what you 're doing , though , you should n't be messing with mounting
ahh , you mean when you have embedded c++ code ?
now , open another shell and use `` lpstat -h localhost:8080 -a '' ... then return to the pipe shell
and possibly gather info on what maintainers ' thoughts was on this . afaik this is also ubuntu related .
u should have apost-earthquake party , considering it 's friday
so you do n't see a login screen or you login and then you get a black screen ? ?
yes i am in ubuntu . i had divorced windows sometimes back .
if you have another power adapter that outputs the same voltage and at least as much current , and has
i 'm in china
try : sudo chmod -r 777 /media/de9d-7998 . so that anybody and everybody has complete access to that device .
time invested .. and i am alreayd behind scheduely on alot of things .. a switch might cost me about
to be honest ; i did not find out about the list view until just a little bit ago .
cool : )
let me share my wip

just auto email them every month that it did n't arrive ?
then it 's nothing to do with drivers on the host running the program
seb is looking at it right now , should be real soon now
because people have personal preferences , same thing with food , cars and various other things . happens .
you 've just said random words
yes i did . therefore i have a black background and kannt set it back.. strange thing
sudoer
sure , what 's up ?
hnn ?
i.e . a way to return something ! = nil from new ( ) that tells the runner not to
it can say `` hey tell me about the addresses for this container id '' as well
if you like that sort of thing
no.. testing for me means running . different game
wilko
try echo `` mt7610u_sta '' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
ack
is there any thing else that i must implement ?
what makes you think it has 15gb free ?
details ?
im also wondering , does the dmesg get cleared if the system get 's rebooted a second time
this is an ubuntu support channel , not an anti-chrome rant channel
what kind of changes ?
my components are laid out in a column on a page , but the page is n't scrollable by default
there should be a setting somewhere in your /etc/apt/apt.conf or a file with the word `` proxy '' in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
loops back to the bios screen
can not reliably say , the story varies
ok now that i 'm looking at the actual ppa , yeah i see gstreamer build successful but everything else
until you explain yourself , nobody can help you . good luck
he has no internet on that system
ah , let me take a look at your -gles merges
so we can still do a retrospective
start some other ( web ) app
cool , we should really expose that
yeah that 's nice
i 'll see if i can get it to do it not on the lock screen ... .tried only a

can you screenshot the results of lshw and link here ? or copy the results into pastebin ?
k sorry
do n't do that ! : )
i 'm not aware of one , sorry .
i wo n't , because those strings are n't translatable ( yet ) - but sure , we 'll take
not all there , but your help is good : )
this is what i would do : copy what you have into a backup file
this channel
bad api request , invalid api_dev_key
well that 's not good ... : ( someone suggested using kali
yo
well shashlik is kde project which can run android apps natively on linux
well , wait , no
or just : /etc/init.d/networking stop
hmm
# ubuntu-server would make more sense for you then
suse or ubuntu
well , those are not the same
ok
use pastebin
whereas in the situation we were in ( with cycles in exported apis ) we literally could n't make forward
no , i guess i 'll just keep the old behaviour
ta
what brand is your hd ?
maybe # snappy can help you building something you need ?
yes , you do n't download nvidia drivers ideally with ubuntu . they can be installed from packages with a
yeah you should be on 3.13.0-73 or 74 by now
i do n't care about anything in /home , but i 'd like to keep /boot and just add the
brand new
you mean you see the usb stick in the bootup of your pc ?
we can also work around it ourselves by not using button in that test
dell witg intel + nvidia
use subprocess.check_call
odd , then .. do you have any care for what is on the hard drive presently ? such that
i see
i do n't think there is a graphical configuration tool for hotkeys . and for the panel thing . i
news for me ... i even wrote it qtmir 's readme file that mir_socket points to a directory
yes shift+insert work to paste
: )
not desktop , but wily phone is quite ignored
doc comments on api helpers ...
thansk !
well , i gather there is qt documentation on it
sure
alsa needs to store the volume and restore it on boot , that is how it should work , i
as far as i know i have never bricked any computer besides my own , i worry about that always
just to be clear , you never deleted that option , is not an option from `` setup '' screens
and install dkms too now
then second , looking at the code - why it 's not iterating over tports if it cares to setdefault
and hitting both wo n't hurt
can not create directory , no such file or directory
well , good luck with that , i wo n't be able to help with that mess
full ack .
i kind of trust others more than me
this is not the place to talk about that .
so reboot ; enter bios ; set to csm , reboot , load xubuntu , mount windows , write command
i mean in css : )
ima try a reboot
i 'll have to go and fix those on 1.23 as well
well ok then , you 're looking for anything talking about video in your dmesg type logs -- honestly the
the dash is just the search thing when you hit windows key
well , that 's kinda good news
i am hoping to see them fixed before our v1.0 milestone
with arrows and spacebar ?
indeed
they appear broken
i would suggest doing an apt-get remove on the package
no , unity-greeter calls those if remote-login-service tells it to . if there 's no one to tell it to
dd if of bs ... i tryed too . show boot error ... did i miss some boot flag on
which version of ubuntu are you on .
it 's also possible that our provides is a bit overzealous there , and we should be providing virtuals like
can we do that ?
try it for yourself : )
libxext bug ?
hence my reqs for the systemd command , and my more recently discovered command of the journalctl to find nginx
that sounds very strange indeed , does both sticks show up correctly with lsusb ?
there is an ubuntu mate iso , yes
but just ping either me or ogra_ and should be fine
vivid rtm mako was fine
sure
when you made that command , what was the output ?
yeah that is what it is looking like . will probably use duplicity due to the ease of rotation
i 'm using dfeet and if i call resetcontexts , i get `` not allowed ''
but ssh starts before openvpn
i see , that makes sense .
when ?
this was published by laney
command line is ... ( remove sensitive info ) ? is the server sshd_config set to allow root login ?
sure , go ahead : )
bug 1466290
well two of us replied to you earlier on how to proceed but you did n't reply ...
ok , once the bug gets approved we can proceed further .
at this phase all new uitk festures address long pending bugs
the bluetooth issues definitely look to be kernel modules not loading , but having reinstalled the kernel images those files
yeah , that fixes the lockup . but the set width is not enforced .
also passes
ahh okay . i just finished work . thought i 'd give this nvidia driver issue another bash : )
so you are creating /home on the ssd ?
ah , indeed the germinate manpage has some stuff to it
locally
is what it showed up the menu says postfix configuration
yes i did ; )
mariadb is better . its like libreoffice vs openoffice .
i guess if i break something i will fix it with apt-get install asterisk
i am just a but dissapointed about the gossips and terminology confusion
i 'm not ranting and this is the first time i have mentioned it here so reel your neck in
grrrr ... citrain tool did n't install the packages
that should be all said in the porting guide . an iirc ubuntu switched to aosp some time ago
`` lsb_release -d ''
in what world is that done *after* multi-series services though ?
ah , last retry actually succeeded , so next britney run should get it
nope , that sounds sane to me
i really think it 'd be easier if they had a fork to make sure we do n't step on
also try replacing 'vim ' with 'nano
how can a floppy drive trip me up if i am not using it ?
oh , i was about to land it for you , but blahdeblah has added you to the keyring .
you would n't happen to have any scripts lying around that would take in a list of releases and sequentially
i 'm not talking about packaging
there is something with dhcp client or similar settings in ubuntu
i never asked you to rebuild u-d-f ; - )
`` boot my backup partition from windows '' sadly does not make any sense
i gave you another
i thought that , but it 's server

run the following command and paste the output . grep `` nouveau '' /etc/modprobe.d/*
it 's not proposed by me

fine , ping me when you need the final review ...
if it is a core ubuntu channel , you can go to # ubuntu-irc-council and discuss your issue
sadly , they put industrial and organizational psychology exam on that day . if it was another subject , i
another piece of info , it takes an age to shit down as well . just has the _ marker
hdstrand had this yesterday evening , but it was related to a bad docker-daemon.apparmor .
yes . it shows s/pdif at 00 . no other devices listed .
the point is : some hosters have custom selfmade recoveries , so it differs what you can do or what
ubuntu mate has a rpi2 edition : )
if you 're doing that , you could blat it using netcat : )
it 's pastebinit in ubuntu ; and needs installing .
clean install after
so it is more likely to be relevant for early models like usb 1.0 and maybe 2.0 ?
pong
since the dash is a single column , just stretching the contents to fit is just fine imo ( the

i did build it on 14.10 chroot and then installed on rtm..but did hit that issue..i created a custom hacky
but , like i said , the target audience for alternate isos and hwe stacks are almost at polar opposites
that video part of your testing routine ?
i already installed the final from the backports ppa : )
windows and mac are as well , you just do n't see it .
you tried 15.04 ?
o
no file-system in there then ... did you encrypt it with something ?
so on my nexus 4 , i should use the aquarius one ?
adb shell system-image-cli -i
anastasiamac_ , hey there , i 've commented on that bug above ^^ ( 1437296 ) - it seems to

please drop it
i just poked him for his view , depends on frquency , does that happen all the time-ish ?
do you have kubuntu-driver-manager installed ?
done
you 'll see it by the swap usage on the host
ca n't access anything man lol
badbodh , tyvm . i did n't know about apt-cache
well i 'm not particularly skilled , more of a generalist.. most bugs are very straightforward to test.. we simply
already ran : (
that 's an odd splash screen o.o
sorry the details about that are n't very clear to me . the build log should say what version of

you can , yes
damnsmalllinux or knoppix ?
and i found the official nodejs is quite out of date , though that was a while ago . there
what image # ?
yeah ... i know i wasted at least that much time on this
so there could be people using deployed environments with addressable containers
sync-monitor and eds , yes .
then what happens the next time ?
but why is it so low ?
hang on , let me start a totally fresh instance and see if i can verify
is there any pattern to which application is being used , or run , when it happens ?
it 's on owncloud
the test port button
ping when you 're free
do you know if anyone is shipping with it enabled yet ?
in snappy , run-checks locally passes fine , every time , with go 1.5 and 1.3 , starting from a
no , just the grub > prompt .
should n't have . firewall has always blocked debian/watch as far as i know . the only loophole is the
tvm
can play the random pick a city and i 'll tell you if there is a confernece there
yeah it 's fine for the moment
so is ap setup for ci now ?
you 're running an i7 or something along those lines ?
do you run minix ?
focus more effort on testing lts dailies
ola
that was n't meant for you . just unfortuate timing
this is tied to a test case so that one can easily get data that is per-test-case
or the fact the dialer is running fullscreen mode ?
looks like you are missing the unit id
i added your paste to that bug ,
fun ; that sounds like an initramfs-tools bug then
yes but that 's lts , good until 2019
is that a question ?
that 's correct , the underlying multi-env layer will add it
no , it 's still there , you can download it if needed but it 's not super trivial -
tech support at my registrar just said to get port 53 unblocked as when they try ping it they can
but why disable the update available message ( /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-updates-available ) . that comes handy unless of course you update regularly
hopefully there is a grub/ubuntu entry in there to select
ok
lsb_release -a
yea man , it 's tomorrow go to bed : )
vlc has a libavplugin that uses libav ( ffmpeg ) codecs to decode x264 , as far as i can
both were installed , will check the image in a few
broken how ?
so it shouldnt be complaining about save location since you havent even chosen one yet
there are quite a few users of the charm package
irt rvgate ; attempting to dual boot on a ssd , unknown on space constraints - . is not ahci
oh ? /topic
sorry , was distracted in another channel
ah yes
that was basically the tl ; dr of the call
yes
i can work those changes in there now . it just depends on how critical this is vis-a-vis getting it
you have to configure grub to boot the .iso
no i 'm just an ubuntu user
that is easy
ok ... try this cd ~/.config/dconf
then have a custom grub + menu in the efi system part . that configfile 's the appropriate grubs
built in a ppa , should n't matter i thought
ok , but what is the way , mir or wayland ?
\o/
i uploaded a potential fix , it worked locally , but lets see if it works once uploaded : )
seems ok here ; i tried updates , app installs and attempt to buy an app
nope
do you have a working recovery which you can use adb shell ?
uh , what was the question ? about apt update files ? sorry , i forgot again , could you
yes
cool , i was thinking it would be more complicated
check out the feature tour
try changing the ap 's channel to 1 , let 's find out if that is caused by using channel
i mean , the creators of the hardware didnt say `` have a great time with this hardware in linux/alsa
5900 i believe
i rather would have constant connection ( :
i barely upgraded to willy i got some errors
one of the fm radio app threads if i see correctly
tell me when i can re-publish the silo
( perhaps there are n't any ... )
the luks header at the start of a raw device is the only way to recognise an encrypted device .
the new grub menu for 14.04 seems to be lacking anywhere to add in a command to the live load
it 's the same iso for dvd and usb . do you need the url again ?
let 's see if it does the kernels
ah , so the problem is that the gnome-bluetooth build is running autoreconf , but is n't re-running intltoolize i
and scp is like sftp
what was the old card ? so we know the command to purge that old driver .
whats the package , bluez ?
in order to avoid regressions on the desktop
i do n't think they are on the ota4 list
fyi the bug seems to be a bug in go 1.3 's c-stack garbage collector . still digging some more
and yeah , it just dies on start 50 % of the time or so
did you open the ssh port on the vps iptables ?
culinary designs by jackson pollock
but your assumption is correct , support for ubuntu at the linux core functions is pretty much the same as
thinking about it , a test at this layer doensnt make sense since it 's actually the responsibility of a
that is probably true : )
sounds like your bash vars got messed up .
could you give the output of 'lspci -k|grep -a 3 vga ' ?
except - i 'll add a comment
yes
and will export support that or do we need a card for that to get updated as well ?
is that the version of firefox you are using ?
on 15.10
the partition table shows 6 partitions while the linux kernel only shows 1 .
ok so would it be possible to add something like ( report a testcase issue here ) instead of calling
is there any easy way to compare two hashes from the command line ?
because ghostscript ( gs ) ca n't read raw-pcl-text files
no , not yet , sorry
that 's made difficult by this being a docker image .
dpkg -l | grep policykit-1
so be patient
why the ppa ?
can i do this in the user logged on ? im having problems..
if you would n't mind explaining what to do , my linux knowledge is limited and i do n't always
glad you got it running : ) gtg bye
`` no access module ''
once i found the directory where the files are by using grep and the content ..but i forgot
i can run snapcraft again and it `` works '' but i suspect it just did n't notice the problem
just have to make sure i can actually reproduce it , so will try it a few more times with
beginning of the big list , which is based on updated_date of snaps
hey there
much appreciated
yeah , alot of us just use the default american english , altho we sometimes find it odd to see
i know , i booted into an older kernel to see if it was a kernel problem ...
it 's n calls instead of one
i have no idea how mate theme are working , you can talk to the ubuntu mate guys maybe
you can obviously even create your own wrapper around exo if you wish ... but since you only seem to
the same .lnk works from my desktop , since the icon is placed there as well . im just curios
: )
there 's a bunch of domains it resolves for , you might be missing stuff if you do by hand
here whats up : the screen switch off , then sound off , then appear a screen locker
which probably needs a rewrite to make it not a separate locale .
you might just request a big box of dvds , pens and stickers , especially if you plan on doing
pastebin your /boot/grub/grub.cfg and the output of sudo lsblk -f
if you have the time and expertise to fix it , try digging around in the logs to see why
got ta ask someone else . i 'm not familiar enough with nomodeset to know such details .
i am 100 % we do not get logs in .cache/upstart
i ran the inxi -fx to create hardware list , its not listed in the printout..
bear in mind you can also install openssh-server on both ; then connect by browsing to sftp : //hostname/ in
yeah , and that seed change from mirv was aimed at wily
rejected :
i just added logical replication for bottledwater , which ended up working fine .
they did n't pull p2
good point
your cat now learned the 'r ' key ?
of course . wordpress as running on apache : )
go talk to wallyworld first
sure , i 'll enter a bug and ping him . and you 're quite welcome : )
i just apt-got it from the 15.04 archive
you work in it branch ?
sorry , brain fart . 'cd ~/downloads '
oh ! i saw some screenshot in `` unixporn '' about i3wm and bspwm , those wm looks awesomes ,
yeah that was my point from the beginning : ) were you trying shift with the live session ? perhaps
i understood anpok tried testing it already ( or well , at least he did test the silo that landed
adding all of this to the list right now
`` installed system '' ?
so you can ssh in now ?
hello mate
it contains hints for moving /boot as well , or some aspects are similar ?
yup , very likely
no , it should work fine , but usually its not used at that level
oops - lxterm is for my setup the same like xterm
i dont know
its wierd cause it was working yesterday
! apt-get
just visit the webui and go to the images page
it 's worth starting again . shutdown . disconnect failed drive . boot the live env again , try reading
also , until it is implemented we ca n't say `` fix resleased ''
is there a way to force this anyway ?
yeah , that should work fine
kolab
well , that 's the api definition
take this somewhere else
i.e . browse to elmundo.es , wait for it to load , if you can scroll open a new tab
which is why i 'm uring you to be cautious
it 's a bit unfortunate in this case as the migration script has one log for all silos , so
in case on the other side ( person using pc i consider remote ) does not know how to open
well that would be greater than the version that copied into utopic , so no
checked their website for firmware updates too ?
p2p patch is still there
that 's exactly what i 'm doing
i want files created by the user to be rwxrwx-x
or the program that checks the signature could be compromised
^
i 'd like to see evidence of that first hand . if you 're going by the image , that
so it 'd have a one in two+ chance of working on every query ? not very good
i guess so . perhaps the set of default installed packages too , and some other minor configuration pieces .
there is an unofficial web store to but i can never remember the link for it popey can possibly point
is that an apparmor denial ?
np
to be clear , an sru for *this particular issue* is appropriate here . `` several other issues '' is
\o
give me a loop hole and i 'll exploit it : )
ok !
ok , this was previously modified in the setup.py file itself , iirc there was a debian bug ?
i generally do sounds lika plan .
this is not the place for os war discussions , as it happens .
it 's on our backlog now .
ah , i though all renames were in the ppa already
ok so i unistall mir components .
going to run to pt appt , but yea please run with this if we have a major ff issue
< tin_man > voyage , i agree with petrvs , unless you just want the experience , a wireless usb
correct
i have no idea
clean installs are reccomended just for that reason
is that required for keystoneclient ?
ack
defaults are only used if it 's being created , it wo n't update those fields if the record already
.config/supertuxkart/challenges.xml change all solved=false to true
out of interest , how was the deepcopy function failing ?
irc is work : p
vivid latest yes , on n4
is it ? : )
that tends to be the way we do it . i currently have cpi and pkgme running on my host
are you the backup glib hacker ? ; - )
adb itself runs well on the command line
what does the branch equivalent do ? it has pretty much the same rules , but we do n't need
spreadsheet line 57 , then
i installed it from source , and i know i made sure libzmq-dev and libzmq3 were removed
++
has this ubuntu pc been used in other locations with different network settings , or , does it have a
have the qa tests been successful ?
/home/ < user > /sambafiles ?
what was the issue exactly ?
i tried 'xinput -- disable `` virtual core xtest keyboard '' '
what errors ?
i mean , it did seem to download the driver
i could probably do some in dogfood for you
tamed how ?
so there is a .xhcat folder in your users home 100 %
yeah , type getfacl /media/zac
ping
ah hmm , so maybe it 's just a case that this is a not-mapped key_code
a blank screen appears and after a while it boots the newest kernel
but there was no space , why the hell did it display it here ?
going to have to hand off to you so i can work with axw tonight on some storage stuff
yes , i 've seen and already thought that it is a little risky race with now better chances for
it 's worth a try , due to the now happening bulk requests .
try # facebook
i 'll add you
pastebin lspci please
so you 're not using flash drives ?
i 'll check , it 's in the /var/lib/mpd so i assumed it had it already .
or take 20 minutes and expect any reply , people tend to give up when you do n't respond
it can be a dependecy

i tried to install rawhide two weeks ago , it was impossible
the bonjour account ?
and attach debdiffs to the bug
ran into something similar this morning that sil fixed with maliit
system-image , although , all-snaps should have one too ; - )
mint is offtopic here and not supported . see ubottu 's last statement on mint
the link i showed you earlier said 173 seems to work , but it has issues with coming back from
never did anything in that area
i 'm on holiday tomorrow , its a 5 character string change and is n't a huge bug anyway
just to avoid any confusion , my system is working fine : )
just interested as to why the aberrant blending clears when you swipe the app away
no , voidrealms
you may check for a setting in your bios then as well .
that 's my same question , just better phrased : )
yes , fresh install
no
can you kick 15.04 edge to pull this version ?
do you know where that tabing windows feature is ?
that worked !
yeah
im running linux quite a bit longer .. i maintain huge clusters as an op
trying it now .
yeah , i noticed that is why i mentioned to copy them ; )
from what you pasted , i see missing slashes for /home/user and /home/luser
it is packing 512mb ram on only one slot . ca n't upgrade it if i wanted to
stop it .
have fun !
thats fine , did it exit the fdisk shell ?
? ?
the symbol retraction in kwin ?
could i kill that and start it again ?
tried that of course , but the player does n't resize with columns , so it 's either a fixed
how do you install that version ?
does it matter that i 'm currently on the intel ?
awesome . you can ask him to merge your changes into his branch
oh right , we do n't really need that on the touch images
you seem to have created new kubuntu_xenial_archive branches already ?
dimitern and the open stack guys are here
kubuntu has different things installed ?
no , i am looking for something commandline/pythonic
oh , i was fairly sure it starts some juju service on boot
i 'm using the devices api , via gomaasapi , to create a device and then allocate an address for
if you can still run apt yeah , if it complains you can remove the initrd of the old kernels
note , i am getting non-apparmor/seccomp error when doing 'docker pull ubuntu : trusty '
ah , currently i see a large light grey scrollbar , is it the equivalent ? or there is a
yeah , but i 'm being dumb or something and failing to get it to build at all there
original was only open source , and my mouse acted crazy , started blinking and hiding
this issue really sounds like fastboot is still enabled
yikes . that `` last successful artifacts '' bit scared me for a sec -- made me think i accidentally
or sudo apt install libflac-dev
is timezone in one of the module lists in cloud.cfg ?
does n't work
i get response from it
one of the things i wanted to check here was that there is nothing special about the default vh ,
the build-deps i 'm still working out , it 's educated guesswork based on knowing that it will build with
this is a bit on the advanced side ; )
using the gui is a little more complicated -_-
you need a ppa then contact the ppa maintainer to support your release
the phone remains with black screen with backlight turn on
yep
you say , audio isnt working , and i say , your mp3 's are not workling , so ,
something like that ?
err , not intentionally ?
`` nova absolute-limits '' fyi
on my local powerpc sbuild , it can not seem to find gcc5
xubuntu/lubuntu are light
i do n't understand what you want
oh ... .
ok ?
what plugin ? curious
ok.. i 'll see
yeah , seems so : p

not keep hidden exactly . just to prevent anyway to go root directory or any other folder than own home
how did you distinguish that from a general outage ?
i ca n't try to replicate it
and look at lines 10 and 11 in your paste ...
it does n't dictate what commands the users can run
could you tell me how to find this backlist ?
no that 's fine i did n't look at the bug too busy looking at the other machine for the
having the install dvd/usb is your best tool in your kit however .
make sure you send me the code , and show me how to run it
error synchronizing after initial wipe : timed out waiting for object ( udisks-error-quark , 0 )
reminds me of a friend who visited svalbard telling me that it 's completely normal there to walk into a
ap test for bug 1438049 and anything else ?
oh , crap . wait . that timestamp windowing you and pitti worked out for only grabbing builds from x
ok - cheers
which silo number is it ?
heh . so one problem is that finding the relation-id means it is a 2 round trip process
have n't verified the bug myself , it 's common to blame the ui toolkit on this kind of bugs
this is so we do n't try to remove the kernel version that is running !
thats very strange . i 'll look at the test , the fact the text is entered ok suggests this
i do n't think we 'll be able to fully gate on autopkgtest for srus like we do for devel
sure that card works oke ?
i'mstill on vivid , maybe it 's fixed in wily
then it keeps changing here , ive asked so many times
yeah nothing seems wrong ... i just have this feeling that maybe i 'm not using the right combination of
haha
baizon already answered you
could be , just could figure out how to open qbzr
but it should not do so by exploding the space of surprising deployment possibilities and hoping they are n't too
but if we want ci tests run then we *have* to do it as a merge
flo/vivid worked after all , needed some time it seems ...
try to shutdown
getting it to pass locally in the sandbox is a good start
there 's no real sacrifice running 15.04 vs 15.10 , there 's not much difference except your optimus gpu syatem
i have set up a proxy in the preseed file ( which works after installation is finished ) , but
hmm , juju now complains it can not reach the maas controller *hmpf* but i already have an idea
yes , i just tried again and it returns `` 404 page not found ''
yes
acpi is fundamental to everything advanced configuration and power interface
i was just catching up on the channel backlog to make sure i was n't asking a question with an
are you saying it 's urgent then ? i thought ota5 was just delayed
you dont need that file mate , thats your actual driver module
test_logging_config= ' < root > =trace ' go test ...
out of curiosity , what info were you looking for ?
whats the actual issue behind all that ?
got it . thanls
no idea , havent worked out their timezones as yet !
i still get the stacktrace . i may have installed bzr via pip ( i ca n't remember at this
did that as well..
will do .
it was on lwn recently
it will take less time than pgp .
see the scrollback for our question
dialog
i do n't care if i can not acces to w7 's folders from xubuntu , i only want share
only because mgedmin just pinged me about it , about to test in a vm
xorg -- configure will generate a template
dunno . although i suspect the basic list of coordinates required and then repeated 3/6 times would be hilariously simple
that article is old . things have changed
they way i would do this , is make a list of your packages with aptoncd and clean install 15.10
feel free to comment on that bug with a detailed explanation of the right way to do things so i
well small impact in the sense that i have no clue what it would require besides 1 function : )
if a2ensite were available , it would create links under /etc/apache . a2 being apache 2 .
so much pain in your early go days
what ?
no fully open source phones exist .
so when i try to highlight the link , it awlays goes in to edit mode
yep , followed procedure step by step : did the mkfs call , then mount , then mkdir -p (
i meant to ask if the script was triggered by cron ?
ca n't you setenv from the job ?
yep : d
read the gpl . your comment is misinformed
not always , you 're forgetting local content
the cru was n't the main problem i do n't think
so a pre-release branch of 1.10 wo n't even exist.. it would be a case of tracking 1.9.x head ?
what 's for lunch ?
you happen to know how i can manually run a /etc/init/* file ( not request a start trough dbus )
i 'll take a look . i need a break from the android stuff .
so ok , i will approve code wise , but let 's make sure we request that before merging
hmm , interesting .
14.04 no longer supported ?
yes they do .
he at some point will leave all of the line
you can mount that at /home
then why wine uses only one thread
no wait , sorry , by setting headphones i get audio on both .
i saw the design in the document attached in the bug report..let me get you the page number
yes , with different ip addresses of course .
i do n't have a clue xd
sudo .
which is configurable per-slideshow , not per-slide
and then ...
i was trying to prove to you that `passwords` needs to be a file , not a directory .
yes folks have tried in the past
according to journalctl fabian-pc login [ 1456 ] : failed login 1 from tty1 for kvm guest reboots host
has it always been slow to shutdown & boot ?
desktop pc right ?
boot from live disk and reinstall
yes , we discussed that earlier , the langpacks updates are buggy
i suppose so .
you could try that , personally i find firefox sometimes turns into a blackhole for the cpu and usually ends
that 's what has me a bit hesitant . there 's nothing weird here . it 's a standard partition
fair enough . : )
yes , right
linux-cloud-tools-generic-lts-vivid : depends : linux-cloud-tools-3.19.0-12-generic but it is not installable
and with subset of the standard library , tailored to each app
no idea where you got -d from
then i do n't understand ... .
should we be worried ?
wubi was a way to install ubuntu from within windows , but it is no longer supported in recent versions
yes
how is the directory mounted ?
ah , i suspect the real revno gets injected when it 's built before upload to the store
which test beds is that aimed at ? something you have set up somewhere ?
is it that the 10.0.3.1 address is private not public ?
picking a subnet is part of provisioning - i.e . part of machine record creation
have you seen that ?
and that leads us to another topic ; if there is anything that would make it easier ( considerin you
so you 're not starting with gnome because you want gnome , but just because you do n't want unity
i did a few times it just broke a few things . and then people say oh re-install .
yes it does have a .service
ok , let 's see once this run finishes , i should n't be too long to have something pushed
and can you please pastebin `` uname -a ; lsb_release -a '' and provide the url ?
all ok
k : - )
type of motherboard ?
cause i put safety first
any such utterances with me around is likely to invoke double ententre and innuendo
i did it , but the same error remains
but let me try that ... maybe qa will not be badly pissed
yw - i 'm looking forward to seeing thumpers branch too : )
mom , partition layout coming
i was just confused
can you fix llvm-3.7 to build on i386 ; )
awesome : )
so the current situation is that jumping into the 64 bit efi stub skips xd ?
bash creates its tempfiles in tmpdir
you said , `` it quit updating ''
remove some old kernels
see each other ?
no calendar app should display 12 as week number instead it displays 11
great , your goget branches are stuck too btw ; - )
i still must say that beer and curry sounds weird : )
stop using enter as spacebar .
well have no user yet in that wiki
tried that
we use rfc-1149 for sending messages
you did not even once tell what actual wifi card you got there .
have a look at the `` unattended-upgrades '' package . just installing it and running the `` unattended-upgrades '' command
i read these days that it performs better than zfs
what about your dish provider customer support , they should fix that problem for free
yeah , lets figure out what it execve ( ) s : /
no i 'm using snappy bin from images ( i may not use the r419 though )
anyway , what you want should be possible , it 's hard to predict what the performance would be like
interseting ...
oh ok ; - )
ok no worries
`` hi '' - there . now wwe got that part out of the way . whew !
hm ... still passes here
i thought so yeah : )
oh ... i have mainview- > page- > game- > scene
hopefully , i ca n't ensure you though that it will be ready or that the ffe will be accepted
i was having issues with fglrx , switching to fglrx-updates seemed to fix it
also read `` charm store policy '' and `` best practices ''
but whatever apt uses to update is segfaulting
okay so i could do the encryption later after installing the ubuntu ?
not seen it before . i do n't think puppet should be reading system configuration files assuming an encoding set
oh yeah no i did n't mean merging all sources , just obliterating the idea of `` gles '' twins
i will also tweak ubuntu before sending to customer
once you create a partition ( e.g . /dev/sdb1 ) then you can mkfs on it .
at least gps now works pretty reliable
try reinstalling kmod
my guess : sudo service cupsd restart
then i 'd use scrot
yeah it was still in place when the delayed trigger in the generic case was called
and with what purpose you use arch portable ?
because we overwrite the streams in the `` publish-revision '' step .
nope : /
? ? ?
do you have the right meta package installed for the kernel ? linux-generic ?
oh i thought it would require a reboot and i assumed anything i install in a live session is gone
you can chroot to the installed os from the live usb deskotp
try adding something to cart : )
have you switched snappy over completely to git , or is it still experimental ?
surely not
but i 'm using uboot , ppa kernel , etc
so this is another confirmation . so this should be reassuring you a bit .
can you move server-mesa-x11.so.4 temporarily out of there please and try again
too bad .
hm . from terminal i see bluetoothd.0.crash
i have not seen that . we have a separate api for cinder , so it 's most likely we
linux sulitpc 3.16.0-4-amd64 # 1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt11-1 ( 2015-05-24 ) x86_64 gnu/linux
the install already knows that he has 3 partitions
well , i was trying to build your fix , but now it fails with the same error on i386
ok
can you paste one
is there a .gkrellm
i 'll set it to dutch next time .
no it 's not , there is like 1.5g
oh good
one sec
ty - rename to anything in particular or just something i will know is that ?
that is strange , but i 'm sure it works fine with home wifi router
where is the problem ? in libarchive or ark or kerfufle ?
but for me , it happened 'before ' choosing the time zone
hm , when was the package built ?
and will run install through erase disk from there
i 'll see if i can find a little time to do that , after i finish what i 'm
funky , alright power off , remove both disks , put the disk that 's storage only to one side
i have however had multiple systems running with btrfs for quite some time without any issues
hehe : )
i had no idea ubuntu provided an adb
sure . i run my own registrar . but the one-time fee is very very high compared to the non-recurring
i can go hours , sometimes a day or two with no problem , would it be bad to simply
pretty sure du is recursive by default
just got to a2
ok thx
i wonder what lxd is doing to build the ubuntu image ? maybe we can use that ?
but we notice alot of black screens/login loops
but that 's easy to change
ok , so after=cgmanager.service should become requires=cgmanager.service then ?
you can discuss that in # ubuntu-offtopic mate
run schroot -e -- all-sessions , and then click-chroot-agent -r
in the app it gives you the options to 'search online ' , 'copy to clipboard ' and 'generate qr
those come from manager decision , it ca n't be something that 's stored on the rootfs
yes , your comment # 1 in that bug is correct
so then what exactly is this 120gb disk
do n't remove the pictures from us together
by mzanetti too
like `` sudo apt-get install vlc libreoffice ''
how do you enable it ? or should i just google ?
then install it clean
first you said you upgraded , then you said you freshly installed . no idea , not enough information to
let me explain : i have an ubuntu server with open-vpn server running . i always use windows as the
i did see the email pass
i 'd expect a different error in that case though - it appears the problem here is within the header
17h utc ?
accesspolicygrantflat is a combination of accesspolicygrant , accessartifactgrant , and accesspolicyartifact .
i am going to get them to work on windows and then try something with ubuntu
could not resist my curiosity : p
did i ?
what version you using ?
wild-guess time , maybe grab a terminal and run grub-install by hand ? i ca n't recall if it just
if there is an env-uuid in the .jenv file , use it
i 'll give you that
you 're a good sounding board
upgrade or fresh install ?
config is empty right ? try doing `` chmod 777 '' on it .
we can chase again wellark but he said is not doable ...
i like my privacy unlike you .
did you remove the ubuntu partitions to install windows ?
install the original precise package with dpkg
sorry , internet is stalling - give me a sec .
in your home directory ... ~/
that 's copy and paste ! : )
what is ?
hopefully be there by the am at least
does that mean it 's working ? : }
they disappear ?
also , me and rafaellaguna have just blitzed social media with it being out : )
i run it in 12.04 , so ... . i 'd think they have it for 14.04 surely
as long as i know grub can load many modules available in `` /boot/grub/i386-pc/ ''
no , i can do apt-get install linux-image-generic and that gets me the new kernel . without dist-upgrade .
but qmltest.cmake should make it into cmake-extras at some poitn
something of the sort
kinda cryptic to me . i guess my real question is would it be difficult to create an encrypted swap
yeah i have . been toying with the idea of running bsd on this thing with zfs
i will try it then i will report back
why are you reinstalling ubuntu ?
the boot screen is white text on black background instead of purple with logo
just to be sure -- that 's totally unrelated to the virtual iface problem , right ?
indeed , the archive is probably the best option
then someone can just add them later .
ha ! another flopy works !
i already did it but the error still outputing
i just want it on sda2 i wont to wife any other partions dude
i 'm passing uris via launch_upstart_application and verifying that they show up in the qml
my mortgage guy is due here any minute and i 'm going to make coffee
sure ! first , get your .snap into the vm
`` sudo service lightdm restart ''
no , one of the plugin packs .
both are plugged in right now ? `` sudo parted -l | nc termbin.com 9999 '' and `` mount |
sorry .
your data might be gone
that is correct , yes
listenaddress is the ip of the server itself
a better fix would be to set the highlightcolor to color , so whenever that changes you will have the
could you also pastebin the one _without_ the ppa ?
what is in package.yaml ? just docker > ?
check /var/log/auth.log for more info
look it up with `` apt-cache search openvpn ''
you do .
hold shift to get a menu and you should get something like integrity check
i have the weather right at my window..
i do n't trust bootrepair - when it messes up it tend to do it spectacularly !
did you have this on lts ?
maybe you should try that fist
nvidia gtx760 and 352.21
when you install , boot up from the firmware as efi mode . mind you , there is more i
and i know you 're slacking , really , sunbathing all the time
raspbian

something that , thinking of it , most people not having a language that needs of it might not have
: d
grab the tar and put the packaging into it
ahh ... tumbler is a dependency of xubuntu-desktop and will then be installed again
after copying the data , right click where it says `` disk 0 / dynamic '' and change it to
which ubuntu version ?
yup it is just dns . i tried potting nameserver 8.8.8.8 in /etc/resolv.conf , but no resolving
ok : )
that what you thinking
so you 're saying to do it manually for each key ?
^
what 's the problem ?
so , two bugs there ( maybe three ) . 1 ) livecd-rootfs should probably have a saner default for
great
should be yes , tvoss is afk right now
nfts errored , so i did ntfs
ok , and your end-goal is installing chrome ?
you 're not using archlinux
does kdeconnect do streaming ?
told you already - enough now . good luck
i 'm still running it
yeah , that 's what i had in mind
even netbsd which is meant to run on practically everything has a very long extensive installation guide for ppc
but
did you try logging in 2-3 times consecutively ?
i take a backup every night , then using rsync and hard links , i create a new backup the
are we really going to show 1000+ comments in a single listview ?
did you not read the website i sent you ?
hi this evening is not good for me
then more startup items will show your list
in `` revenge '' , you could clue me a bit further on how to use stress-ng : )
all tagged now too
select `` enable assistive technologies ''
you need a -- scale option on xrandr
not surprised , browsers do hw acceleration
have you installed virtualbox from the repositories or from virtualbox.org ?
ok , move on to the grub commands now
actually , looks like you did n't purge mysql-server-5.5 from that error message
i 'm helping pieter2627 fix a bug in a package
if mount -- bind fails ( e.g . strict lxc/apparmor ) , then we just give them the latter location
it just goes `` you have 19 extra revisions : '' and then `` error new commits : ''
i did not know that there actually is an xf86screensaver button . interesting .
do n't worry , you 're right i must change usb for pcie to add wifi network to a pc
the installation of ubuntu 14.04 worked very well . installing the ppa is simply not working as expected . the
thats the pastebin in my previous message
hi
and many applications do stuff in /home/
how this happen ? and whats the cause i couldnot figure out ... i searched in google but couldnot find
how did you install libreoffice ?
no , i still get those 5c and 5d chars
no , that 's an implementation detail ; but in any case once we do release , which is sometime
yes ? ^^
unless you do a merge
err , except that my update here found no changes ...
i was trying to avoid copying and pasting the code for serialization of procdetails
is it ssd or mechanical hd ?
yes it is unlocked
i tried it with a new created user . ( new home-dir ) without success
i added azure as well since i was gon na start with it today and i realized it might have

is that it these days ? wow
seems that is video card is a bit problematic ... nv44 [ geforce 6200 turbocache ]
you can just run the script yourself , its in /tmp after you deploy it from qtc
because it wants a block for gpl-2
kdev-python vs. kdev-python-randomnumber-py3 is very messy as they install the same files . also apparently the py2 version actually has

ctrl+x
the receiver must be associated with both parts , what make are they ?
its combined and a few timing extras
i do n't think that that bug is relevant to the content hub
i do n't understand .
ok ... try now
models i mean
no , no . i am debugging the slowness . i am not using scp to do any work .
some other player ?
no . each command and feedback goes under the previous one ... terminal standard behavior
should be good now
and i guess the actual break is the fix for the issue you were looking for : /
yea that would be cool
because you 're running the tests with ./ ... you 're not picking up that snappy for the test runner
what sort of failures ?
no problem - let 's hope we can get this all fixed : )
i can not even get into the container . it is a zombie
should i also remove the set -x in that script ?
he was hungry
ah
it means i looked that far . : p
then what can i do to resolve this ?
a worthy cause for delay : )
does n't have to be perl , could be a python or shell script
i am not blaming you
tail -f /var/log/syslog while you messing with bluetooth
buh-buh-buh .
core i5 with centrino wifi
oh well , already tested a lot of the 3.19 kernels for another bug report , not again hehe
ack ? not awk ?
you can try on core if you want , less to download and it gives the same error
you dont need internet to run a md5sum check
the *process* itself is type dependent
ok , i 'm doing the standard stuff to clean up fglrx 's mess and switch to the `` radeon
so then the problem is in the script . put some echos in different places in the script , (
strange , if they 're completely anonymous i would think that they would n't contain personal information ? makes sense
no , certainly not ; maybe that 's just the default state until we actually get wily translations ?
then i 'm not even sure there is an upgrade path at all . the raspberry pi uses a custom
right
well it appeared to not have any trouble with partitions here
i discovered that after banging my head a bit ... a long time ago now
you have become our resident mgo expert now
which part ?
i had that problem
ok , do n't worry too much , if there 's a problem the kernel may have frozen
way over my head , i have no idea what that means and it sounds way more complicated than running
i mean android hal for graphics and telephony
sure
nonono
and for the common case of a contiguous block it will work fine
i 've also had issues with kwallet.. i setup the password , reboot , password not accepted.. damn
yeah , richard wants to now use them for gnome / fedora but they can still remain supported by plugins
interesting
try with_items rather than with_dict
nope
is there a place that i can paste pohotos to ?
did you add it by error there ? was it meant to be for -autopilot ?
got ta kinda of think of it like if you bought a mac then ran windows on it and it
the name of the wifi network
i 'd just make a new array then reinstate the data from your backups
you said you use a different console proggy than konsole ? which one was it again ?
natefinch : is it possible for you two to pair for the remaining time ?
for multiple commands , use & & between commands .
yeah saw that now too
the handler onnewconnection does set it
deployer , gui , quickstart ...
my sources list for ubuntu is some 60 lines long
rvr said it did n't help ; /
ok , i tried , so if i enter rubbis it does not acitvate it
and the installer accepted your location , name and pw etc ?
i understand that it typically skips 2 or 3 kernel revisions between *ubuntu releases
you can re-key your luks , although yeah , that 's kind of unfortunate .
yes
i wonder why my aquaris 4.5 does n't popup the unlock text .
k. i 'll ask tomorrow
so , you have no console while it 's trying to boot ?
pretty sure kubuntu uses lightdm
we don ; t have the answers . wait for someone who does , or allow us some time to
ah , the hang was because apparently something between my camera/libgphoto/shotwell did n't like the two mini `` synthetic ''
oh , is it external ?
read the channel rules . no swearing
man dpkg ( you have to start learning how to find things out for yourself - you 've been in
wayttd ?
ok ! sorry ! lol
thats depends on the specifics of your raid .
no , i 'm pretty sure i 've asked this before . : p
okay , we only care about armhf here
rvr : we have n't changed anything on packaging/deps on those branches
there may be something in syslog about it ( try searching for 'memory ' or 'oom ' )
why did you came to warsaw ?
what about the lp integration it had
you can configure that in your request
mkfs.ext4 /dev/whatever then chmod/own it as needed
just the form on september 10 ( so not /that/ long ago )
oh , sir . let me try .
well i have n't tried using a live cd and store data on this . but in the creation with
what day is it on ?
you keep asking very generally ( and mostly non-ubuntu ) questions . do you have a direct support issue ?
try what ?
will do that now
let 's wait for user testing
that is what i am trying to figure out . mind taking a look at my smb.conf ?
does it get # include 'd anywhere ?
no problem at all , it appears that i did n't know the procedure well enough , that 2 pings
but if it had existed , they probably would have loved it : )
check if it is down . change to a mirror that is availabl
i suppose this might be more of a ci-problem , so maybe pinging cihelp might be the right way
sudo umount /dev/sdb1 -v
but you work on ubuntu desktop why would you want news on windows ?
yeah
sooo ideally , in the main sdl_mirevents.c
apache just mod_proxy 's stuff to the relevant component/appserver based on url
can you get a minimal , no x , server , headless install ?
fine here for me
just check as a curiosity , it might offer a newer kernel . i suspect you may already be on
\o/

it sounds like something you 're loading within xorg for that user , a startup app , or something is
they only have cd drives . network install is not able to download behind proxy server . i set up
apparently not b/c you introduced landscape into the equation at the end
that 's brave of you to say
so what ?
hrm . vivid or rtm ?
yes - that is right
it 's active in unity only .
the problem i 'm trying to workaround - for rakesh123 - is how to enable rsylog to collect the journald
just right click on folder select copy . then paste it another location
to be able to do that query , you need less data than to ensure it stays like this during
sorry no . no access .
ok , expand on `` uploads '' : )
the icon download comes from using the snappy api
also for later , did you talk with mark about properties vs hints ?
add one ppa to the defaults , you count as a distro ?
^^
i pressed + and found `` create partition ''
see `` data persistence '' in the spec
which will be a fairly low frequency event i imagine so not a performance issue
your nick is how people know you on irc . please do n't change your nicknames too often ( use
yeah , without it disabled the machine couldnt even get through the bootstrap
yep , will do
no , its an indicator
show me the output
it 's not what i want , it 's the name defined in the documentation - i have no control
it looks perfectly correct
you think it makes any diffrence if i use 32 bit 14.04 versus 64bit
great minds think alike : d
the clue is in the `` psh '' prefix of the error message .
thats syslog you pasted
different hard coded device identifier
that release is end of life and out of support

create the following partitions in the installer : a . 1mb - reserved bios boot partition . 2 . 1g

what about the 4.1.2 kernel

it boiled down to just adjusting the gradient values . width was already right

what kind of notice ?
i use dns . i also use ipv6 so there is only 1 ip
do you have your layer somewhere ?
i find goddies and 'baddies ' in both but i see kde apps have a very active app development while

is lightdm running ?
the error was weird , good job .
now done ! we 'll probably want another image build soon .
coward ! ! ! !
note.. silo004 contained a new mir package , than the one that got migrated from proposed to wily
oh , right , sorry , done !
yeah for `` adding python to system-image seeds to support walinuxagent ''
the issue looks like if you have a '- ' in the unit name it fails
sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source
have purged app ( retext ) , reinstalled , does not help either .
which currently means running alt-space kubuntu-devel-release-upgrade

it has some files in it

agreed : - ) no worries
the deejay might be the one that makes the scoop . #
the binaries should be there any minute now
just copy the file to your /home/ubuntu dir and do chmod +x on it there if you want
cheers
nobody is mad , just keep in mind this channel is familly friendly
that is going to cause problems due to arp ; i 'll let catphish tell you : )

do you ever open two or more windows of the same application ?
true , so ture
yep
is it in bzr ?
not that simple .
will do , just got ta close out of the installer and do that then
8pm
if not , you can `` echo u1_debug=1 > > /etc/environment '' and reboot , and should get a lot

ok i 'm sorry , but you are not a good student . go find a channel for whatever linux
yeah , read it . but why ? simply helping me to understand it . it 's a new topic
we used ubuntukylin-default-settings at first
and really , it 's all we actually need . the problem here was n't being unable to set the
for beagle and some others that 's true
they go well together with template units ( but they do n't necessarily have to use them )
ok , will try that
no problemmo
yeah , i was wondering why you dont include it ... does it get so big ?
kill the app
looks like it has lots of javascript
lazypower : did n't trigger the error on the third redeploy with debug-hooks . oh well : / ( if
the version in vivid should be fine , i have n't touched that code in quite a while ...
is n't there a setstatusy method on context ? which can then just store the flag , and then runhook.execute
no . just set replaces field so apt knows the upgrade path
seriously though < - from someone who 's spent a lot of times using vts ... use xorg , linux
checked , xorg is 1-2 % and baloo_file_extractor goes to 7 % sometimes , others ' consumption is not shown
is n't that `` blue '' actually `` canonical orange '' ?
mhl
then once it 's in trunk i build a click from trunk using jenkins
that wahat i thought thoo
yes , but pythonistas do n't like \ that much .
^5 !
*nod*
also , if you 're not altering the upstream source , but rather just adding config options to enable new
i do n't think so
that 's outlined in the readme , but you can run the unit tests with ./runtests.sh unit
you should come next time
what is blocked ? input or output or both ?
i have a 2tb drive , i made a pile of 20g partitions just for test installs .
this is actually what unity 7 does
just because it shows in dmesg does n't mean it 's going to explode your system : p
oke then you answered your own question .
without it , ping responses are from the container ip
that would be amazing being as i 'm in shrewsbury : d
salem_ just checked and the problem is there even without the silo ( bug reported already ) , so the
i know it 's not ready , i 'm not going to _land_ it
that kde theme needs an upgrade
i had -- verbose ...
site : reddit.com < subject to search for >
all looks fairly mechanical
i recenlty found fastboot on a medion somewhere deep inside
init 's or one of its child processes , yes : )
it is almost broken
yes
maybe the # conky guys might know ?
well , what did this specific error mean ?
what was the script 's name called ?
my guess would by a dutchie too ? : #
changing uploaded files is weird , but then again it 's not as the same user is changing them from
feel free to file a bug about that .
ok , type cp -a /boot /boot.old
hold the mayo , i know that mtp drivers get kinda slacky somewhere , i use 12.04 , thought 14.04
well , ubuntu ca n't be responsible for wich addons users install right
wich ssd and did you change bios from ide to ahci ?
ok , yep ... that 'll be problematic . `` sudo chown -r www-data : /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-content ''
( it may well not be malware on the user 's system at all , but rather a forged from
and what was missing on it ? an ok from design ?
this is ubuntu . try asking in # debian
that 's unrealistic , go rewrite my software for me
forget that
so glad there 's something other than iwlist and iwconfig
ok
so it then becomes possible for instance to compare those between two binaries
why do apt-get breaks eventually when ones only update non boot related packages ? like locking up boot related packages
strikes me as kind of fragile , you could easily 'fool ' a sys-admin with that
ma che grazie , go do some reviews yourself now : )
possibly but unlikely
locking/unlocking fixex my clicking
should n't it be smartctl -s on /dev/sda ?
the thunderbolt hardware is n't exposed to the os until we start pretending to be darwin
you 're probably correct that moving the proxyupdater was papering over some other problem
i can not reproduce the bug
presumably superceded by harvest-mode
ah
-c is 1024 by default . i 'd sort that out first before going down the route of changing system
and that imo is backward-compatible with older clients
it did not find my device although .
iso and uui were both verified with a sum checker tool in windows , it was included in w8 .
are you on 10gbps or just gigabit ?
i do n't need it
if you checked the url lotuspsychje gave you , and nothing works , file a bugreport .
yeah , i did , was just surprised it does n't rebuild them all by default
wat
so you wait until now to mention it happens on more than one system ?
the software is up-to-date
just go to the windows machine and try to ping your ubuntu machine
grep nouveau /etc/modprobe.d/*
is it that unlabled button near the sd card ?
what is grub doing ?
can be . take a look at that jenkins output , it pings until the results appear , after like
yeah specify those two nameservers and give her a go .
no , vivid has the same
in which case you could use sudo tail -f
just learn to live timezone-free , like i do .
k , let 's see how the list discussion goes then
if you see the old header , i would remove it at this point
i had a play yesterday , and build sdl2 with the mir options enabled , and then dpkg -i'ed the
when you say trunk , you mean lp : ubuntu-system-settings/rtm-14.09 , right ? cause that mr is for the rtm
that has a certain logic to it
yep looks like it did find a good bug .
torrents are faster than direct download in my experience .
the daemons crashing . oh , unless you mean ulimit has changed , and is now a lie ...
they were , but only in unity8-fake-env
you can clear disk cache with a command
what is it ?
yes , i was writing that line for you = )
i am wondering if the info in this doc is stale
if you want , you can run whatever versions of software you like
sure , i have posted in ubuntu forums , i will wait for 1 -2 days before re-install 14.10
do you know by any chance if the pbuilders for the silos have been upgraded very recently ?
where did you get that iso from ?
short story , backporting from the devel series for srus is generally frowned upon , but if that 's the
^ fyi
you using dual boot ?
and also : `` we did some test and track this problem in libusb but seems there is no such
i 'll spend some more time architechting it better i guess
you 'd have to check the aws specs , and look at the current usage with the command `` free
i do have the rights then to do dput on that silo ?
that being participating , not applying for funds , i can do that ; )
no , the desktop cd ( livecd ) wo n't install a server sysstem , only the desktop system ,
i wan na know the permissions
in theory , this should have been resolved with the systemd uploads i did in late vivid to make sure
quicker , and woth the shot
wow !
and excluding fully built virtual machines .
years ago i used a tool that would correct all the tags and ensure each version of id was present
but mms and lte only apns do n't have the check box right ?
by wine i mean
no such device or address
so will i be able to use linux in a near future , less i switch to a external usb
that might be lighter
ok , demoted
when done , can you ping me as i 'd like to discuss filesystem providers etc
just click on .exe
that looks right ? is n't there a `` / '' missing in the first one ?
no such file
first read the link . you seem to have no clue what all that is .
it seems to work with lower case os.environ [ 'no_proxy ' ] = '127.0.0.1 ' : )
i 'm a troll because i do n't want my searches in unity to go to amazon aswell ?
seems pretty simple from what i read
i yesterday changed to the rc channel to enjoy dem ' updates
nw . should i be using the old spreadsheet if i need this landed or will this do the jobfor
html5 , got it :3
if all else fails , just determine the offset and systemd.check_call ( 'dd ofs=nnnn bs=4m % ( file ) s
okay , so that should address that issue as well ?
/path/to/java8 file.jar8 ; /path/to/java7 file.jar ?
ok , type ls -l /boot/efi | nc termbin.com 9999
nothing wrong with asking questions
for the rest , just get the source from upstream and package it yourself
although doing the string parsing bit would n't hurt , i suppose .
are you familiar with using text editors in the terminal ?
yep
yes , this box is a router ( and switch , and wap )
that 's sweet
where is he ?
win8 should create the esp or efi partition for you , and ubuntu should use the win8 one
you could have an issue specific to skype.. and not with the hardware at all
the .iso contents of all releases after 14.04 that i saw , had iso-8859-15 in filesystem.squashfs
i suppose so far it was done by you or cjwatson or possibly dpm ?
ls /dev/ubuntu
you tried to click on it ? when i click on it , it comes in , no problem.. would

i dont know what command you actually used , what error that command produced and what folder you were running
so right now you can start with development and just ignore the fact that that app rotates to portrait .
already taken
ok , i added `` cd autopilot '' to me shell script : )

is n't that the hardware that is coming in on dec 9th ?
if you have multiple users , perhaps $ path would be better ? i only have one , so for
but i do n't have any instance in aws
as for porting to ubuntu , i 'd probably just put the effort into improving vinux
that 's the hope .
well , i dont know . is n't there something like -reinstall ?
slim possibility that it might be
ca n't say anything without debugging first though
anyway , that 's a sep from my point of view : ) i suppose the greeter session crashes ?
it should if you avoid running it in the background
correct
read the header of the mbr-diag.s the comments there give an example
there is a program called aa-logprof , yes , but it is n't smart enough to know to update the
it was possible in that one special case . because the command is still there and you essentially broke your

sure
just make sure to use strong passwords that 're different than your logon passwords and such , to make it
ok. and you know about graphical output for them as well , there is .svg about it
sudo netstat -lnp | grep vino
thot it was ... complaining about mir_input_event_get_touch_event
the kern.log collects all the kernel messages , especially device i/o errors
the design team only consists of canonical employees . : )
i 'll put it up there with paxos and raft
`` make and model '' ? what do u mean ?
works on my machine anyway
yes ! also , you can link from the rss feed to the click store
vx32l
oh , i would n't joke about that !
that is the graeme dude man
ok
yup , as far as we know we 're still waiting on the cla stuff
do you have any alternative ?
oh , yuck
i originally made /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/zachary
odd , was sure i installed that but will check
ok , if i do this again i will just assume lubuntu are taking part .
or just run on silos : d
sorry mate you are right , i found the image file
done
the reason why we do n't default is that it was nacked at a v-uds . th
okay , nm then : )
and then why not make a ppa and provide that program with that ppa ?
no
so hgow do i use that imnage now ?
yup , you 're right : ) bisecting ...
why ?
yes i can see , group can only read , i change it ...
so then you understand all the ins and outs of c++ , memory management , and all that jazz ?
agree . i 'd love to have time to fix it , and integrate it with our automated test results
indeed .
netstat can do that .
so line 72 is for silent mode
k , i 'll file a bug
hey ! that 's fantastic to know . i 'm sure we 'll get other users with the same issue
you will find that the `` official '' support channels for any oss project try to stray pretty strictly on-topic
for upstart , add a .override file with the `` manual '' option in it
people are lazy ... so there 's autologin of course
much appreciated guys !
and it fails too ?
anyhow , you 're either booting to a recovery shell or to single user mode . you 're not in
right , i would have though so , but it says it 's an invalid series
i 'm on low battery , but i 'll be back on in 40 minutes or so .
cheers : )
you are special
ok
oh , wait no that 's something else
have you tried to change the hostname on your ubuntu machine ?
ah nice : - )
sorry , doing so
by the way , having that many event filters attached to the window does scare me a bit . it
it 's like a really old phone , that ca n't make calls , and has a crappy java interface
how did you install ff ?
at sh ?
that will work
i 'll pick it now
please do ; )
i 'm not saying do n't go of course
someone at some point in the distant future may be able to do it , but it 's just not
yes , it 's that menu , except it does n't show the current workspace opened up ... how can

oh , this activation , sorry , was confused
the entire touch security model hinges on apparmor
what 's your win7 media ?
the code sets the memory constraint even if the cpu power was set ... which could cause a different instance
weird
should be fixable now at least
badblock on sdb
rogpeppe : submitting an inline comment takes you away from the review page
it 's a replacement for gnu/screen , has more features - it 's downside being it 's non-copyleft and developed

the build in amhrf failed in deb-o-matic due to a segfault on testing , but maybe it 's just there
answer the questions i ask
sure
in which case using it for gfx_mode should be ok , and with 'keep ' linux should maintain it .
so it lands the translations and _then_ updates the pot file ?
was it connected to the usb lead before or after the power switch and vol down hold ? i found
if you have things you do n't like and want changed , best is to file a bug about it
from the base of the kernel source-code tree : `` patch -p1 < path/to/patc/file.diff ''
waiting totally patiently
note that it will go away when the iframe thing lands later this week .
try mkdir -p /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu
sad .
ok
err no : )
no worries , i wo n't tell anyone
i was going to look at it more closely after breakfast .
`` why are you not booting into ubuntu ''
i already told you on trello
yes , ca n't use legacy while in secure boot mode
my friends can steal my system !
ok , contact your lug
it 's running as root .
ack , will speak to jibel
so you have the displayport connector just beside the ps/2 ports and the vga , too ?
i 'm still not having much luck getting chainloading to work with inception in kvm , and still issues with
it just sets some classes . backport should be trivial
there is named-checkconf utility
should be fixed in the next build now \o/
ok - sounds good to me
not yet , i just answered you on the codein interface
the only missed thing on this image is the sudo
my middle name is `` lightning '' : ) for a reason
to be honest , very little was hard to grok
also do you know of a way to create a recoverable problem in an app ? just calling recoverable_problem does
/dev/urandom gives random bytes , /dev/zero gives null bytes
it would n't be `` *-ide '' right ? i got a `` *-isa '' and `` *-pci:3 '' with

ok
investigate silent : p
nvidia say the 173 driver /// are you booted up in the ailing system at this time ?
yeah , i would ; `` you '' should own all directories in your /home .
at least one reason would be that unity8 still uses the window title ( app name ) from desktop files
ok , press enter
good night : ) later !
it *looked* ok , but it had enough extra non-obvious math that i was going to have to write test
so far , now docker fails to install here and errors out correctly
but viruses are n't really the problem anymore
amazing
we ca n't land music-app at the same time ... there 's a lot of other things that need work
got you , i 'll do some decen debugging and will find out what is going on
yep , it sounded like you were just tinkering , hence my tinker-y suggestion
what does /proc/mounts tell us
while you 're wiating ...
i 've done this .
howdy
oh yeah , new api , i was n't following you ; yes , that exposed api needs approval and
he thinks that our apps ppa is not the right place since people interested in apps would be unlikely to
ca n't provide backwards support forever , look at windows ; )
you tend to burn thought tim when you compile on a regular basis
why does it need a rebuild ? you 've just added a debug output . if you 're debugging ,
what does it say ?
since the ppa wo n't allow a same-version upload , but if i remove the package from the ppa it
i 'll double check it here as well
yes , but if there was a bot then other people with lesser editors could use it , too :
from the core distro , an apt-get build-dep unity8 should work

tsdgeos : do you have any tests for this ?
do you happen to listen to taiwanese , chinese or japanese streams ?
it not yet has merged michaels latest changes
in first implementation yes , in tests i really liked the indirect approach - here with feature flag , but
and let 's start from a fresh baseline . please do 'sudo unity8-lxc-setup -- rebuild-all -- redownload '' .
are you on the livecd ?
afaik , clock does not specify the url at all..so the sdk does all the handling when it comes to

yeah , from wily is .4 anyway
i do n't think i 've encountered this specifically before .
i wiped the hdd clean when got the laptop and then i used legacy mode to install w7 and kubuntu
ok mate re-ask here once in a while , maybe there 's an ubuntu arm channel somewhere too ?
it 's not an iso file .
it took me a *very* long time to switch to the sequencer , and the only reason i use it
the ip is unchanged . maybe i should copy my host file to verify
it looks like that solved the problem , curiously cinnamon killed it self , but it looks like i can
will disabling ipv6 completely , prevent me from connecting to an ipv6 address if i only have ipv4 ips ?
ahh .
try installing xubuntu-desktop
the drama does us no good and is annoying .
yeah i am but not connecting
when you boot , hit `` shift '' or `` esc '' from the post screen so you can tell
the developers wil hardly realize the difference : ) the bonus is that the ubuntu sdk will just work on
what about removing all the superflous ones ?
still you have it crashing i 'm concerned that what you 're doing is basically workaround the test
is that a dekstop ?
but you 're still stuck in the situation of downloading the updates manually and installing them
and note i would prefer to do this via iptables - you can make sure related , established traffic can
oh you mean you got the error when you went to create the ticket ?
yes , finally : )
okay .
reproducable on all flavours i tested .
ok cool
# # cars does
oh right ... i forgot citrain exists
but even in the terminal the wrong java version is shown if i do java -version .
but also apparently webdm uses /tmp/snaps as the place to which to download things from the store ?
have you tried restarting it ?
no , i do n't think anyone has a git snapshot packaged
nope that 's the right one , just wanted to confirm since i do see the restore missing files option
^
'error : unrecognized disk label '
iirc , they expect if you 're using -core , you 'll know how to use the cli : )
hi
kde uses ssdm iirc now
well , then that 's a bug on it 's own , no ?
i can not connect to my vps
they have their uses .
you have a review on 1005
okay , the img stuff is what i 'm talking about .
which is trivial in this case
wow ! that was quick , considering that reboots and plymouth are involved..
try # ubuntu-touch for mobile
and then obviously anything by the kinks

you liar
i thought you would *do* them..
you could have just copied
which ubuntu are you on ?
i do n't think he has problems removing them
i 'm starting to think we should rip *all* the code out of the spreadsheet and use it purely as

no timestamp ? it does for me
when i run upgrade apt still thinks it needs to install it however
lem me see if i can find how to fix it and i 'll let you know
using dd is literally only one line
i know for a fact it does
well try opening it again
do you have gnome-terminal installed ? are you on unity ?
dunno , maybe the plan did but it has n't been uploaded to match ?
i trust you , whenever you think is right
i simply mean when you first start the system
but here 's the kicker - > ( date1 < date2 ) is the same as ( date1.gettime ( )
as the security update may be delayed ( for other releases as well ) to tomorrow
i 'll have to look at it on my return , i 'm off out to a meeting
maybe it 's not booting anymore
that 's done via `` /etc/xen/ $ guest config files , with e.g . `` cpus= '' 2-4 '' ``
never the less all alarms are saved , so the error might be some false alarm somewhere
can y ou please file a bug ?
theres little i can do to help you then , keep asking here in channel im sure for the gurus
no that doesnt make sense .
/etc/ is n't read-only ?
ran update , ugrade , then dist-upgrade and rebooted - still nothing but command line
i 've noticed the three patches that are included on the download pages for some of the kernels . would

its best to repeat your issue to the channel once in a while , so others can read
yes
no
yep , we have n't changed the ringtone behavior in any of the mr 's in that silo .
and we 're not done updating all the things yet
it 's your choice . neither good nor bad
tarsnap !
i mean from your pastebin above the netmask was 255.255.255.0 for 10.0.0.0 , which is a /24 , are you
yes , u cant
no , you can fix that like said in the answer . its just that windows would undo the fix
tbh i dont remmber , but if you need it you can install it
no problems
uh , did you have some reason to require a higher version ?
?
i have that file in /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/mdns - for you its not there you say ?
there are 6 boxes
do n't workaround the crashes : d ( j/k )

you asked about uefi . i 'm guessing you did not read the uefi link . no on is going
yes , i was on that page before and went thru the troubleshooting
jups , else windows could not detect it , so no bios issue/upgrade needed
keeping up-to-date ( like windows )
i like the web dev earlier who works from windows , but then copies the files onto a linux vm
i guess a simple `` juju- '' vs `` juju-br- '' prefix will give us enough space up to ``
that bit of code in music that is linked was written in sept 2013 ! blimey
yo can
what a ripoff ...
so running s3 tests on v3-unstable worked , on your branch failed the same way
i loved it when i got to try it
could you before ?
if you need wifi encryption though ... wpa is better than wep
multiarch yeah i dunno , lintian being drunk again
okular : depends : libokularcore6 ( = 4:15.04.2-0ubuntu3 ) but 4:15.08.0-0ubuntu1 is to be installed
that seems a pointless swap partition size
i am just trying one of their searching tricks and techniques .
try the branch see what you think ... ; - )
i use riseup email which does contacts , but i ca n't think of anything popular other then google and
you have to type the whole thing out
hm that sounds doable
that should work . i always use add-apt-repository from software-properties-common
big prob little solution
released a couple of days ago
help command in the application menu .
i 'd remove the complement out and use snappy . [ part|package ]
i dont know if grub-customizer put it there by mistake
this is a result of the prepare job being untestable ; - )
why ? i ca n't touch the windows 10 .
appears to be the same versions of abiword in .1 and .2
can you select a different graphics card in virtualbox ?
excellent . : d
yep
hey
do you check their integrity ?
what ? that is filesystem . one of the best filesystems ever .
well , the only thing we can do there is to add yet another key like : x-ubuntu-touch-legacy
fair point
the branches are not approved either yet . i 'd like greyback to do that . but he 's done
how do i do this in xubuntu : `` enable `` changable menu accelerators '' in xfce4-appearance-settings - > last
can we chat in about 10min ?
nothing that a cowbar cant handle
i see suggestions based on entered text splited into several sections
but you can try ! we installed ubuntu yesterday , chat is working , stream 's window is black .
well ok i just wanted to know if someone had experienced any , if they did then i would not
i just build and run on the desktop
reboot , check logs
but if it is a issue with your isp routing you cant do anything but wait
ie , it will work fine from the shell and from within the snap itself
can you chec muon ?
it really is not necessary , and can make you more likely to get something bad
oh , why are you doing that ?
geforce gtx 770
this server is not in charge of by me
( sorry , sprint hectic/delay ) i followed up to the bug with a quick proposal
you may think you remember everything ... but unless you 've written it all down , i would n't trust
not really
probably best to reschedule , was trying to dance around a close-to-lunchtime dentist appt
type `` nvidia '' then hit tab , it might resolve a -uninstall
lining a coffin probably
well , no , there are definitely ints and booleans
perhaps try later on # tracker on gimpnet , no one around atm though
this channel does ubuntu support only
i have no idea what you just said there : (
can do , if noone beats me to it ( not today any more )
depends on my mood , usually by hand .
pass
?
so you currently have only 4 gigs
rvr , davmor2 : ^ silo 25 ready for sign-off it seems !
ok , great , reboot the live usb , and you 'll almost be done
looked like you guys had fun !
u mean u cant ssh to box ?
type sudo service lightdm restart
still frozen
if i boot with `` root=/dev/vda4 '' it works
that would be helpful : )
yes , with the same redirect
then reboot and join this chat . we will take it from there .
nvm it accepted ubuntu password : )
that is true ... i do basic sanity check , but only basic . releasing the uitk is by far
oh . what are the symptoms ?
tj- told me not to purge nvidia
that 's ok , just let us know when it is fixed
it works the mouse : )
i never run unkown binaries and i do recommend any other fellow computer users the same attitude .
where did you get your drivers from ? are you having this problem in a laptop ?
one sec , just finishing standup
i shall set up a staging site at bluesabre 's wiki again
thx
my issue now stems from maas ... ..do you know if there a was to have maas provision ( commission
=/
really ? care to share ?
+1
i blame you entirely ; )
is it a know issue that sometimes notify-osd wo n't disappear ?
i 'm asking becouse those plasmacrashes are super common .
is it seeing nmea from the device now ?
stopping all the individual drives , removing the array and zeroing the superblocks should be enough .
sure , but formal qa approval first
but i do n't really need a logical volume group . i 'm not trying to combine multiple disks into
oke , what repo ?
you have to `debuild -s` then upload to the ppas
think i found the problem
yes , yesterday
np , i 'll ask him tonight , it 's not critical
that 's fine , getting 404 , the problem is getting the error on a completely unrelated operation on a
i do see a spare network interface in us-east-1
so the i386 seccomp regression is in xenial already , i reproduced it without -proposed
does n't it work is xmpp too ?
fairly important ones too , like unity8
i was thinking breaks & replaces actually
that sounds good to me
ah , then this should indeed be fixed : )
did various of this weird stuff
grab the config from a running kernel on ubuntu and work from that
because i may change some things for systemd vs fsck vs plymouth
oh boy ... so where is sources.list located ? : /
screendisplay in settings
no you 're just misinterpeting what mirroring means
juju min . version is the one we 'll be focusing on next
were you going to make that other change to toggle the playing state by tapping in the same mp or
run it with 'screen ' in future
can you explain to channel whats happening exactly
if the feature flag is not on , juju-br0 will be used with dhcp for both kvm and lxc on
i have no idea . i thought it was not ...
for what ?
which error do you get ?
i do have btrfs partitions and the package you mentions installed . i have several snapshots created without problems like
but the pictures you see in blank icons right , ?
but developers have to do that too when they run tests locally
i 'll try 014 with 'ack ' checked , since that 's what it 'd require for the universe packages
model_name
they are working on reproducing the issues virtually
package manager , same as any other
not in -password , only in the files that pass the 'unwrap ' option
if the tcp sessions connect to the remote host , but no data is returned , i 'd suspect a
put it into a pastebin please and provide the url .
device = /dev/sda2 and type is fuseblk
you mean.. download the iso , and burn it to an usb stick ?
i made a backup before the upgrade ... : ) will be looking into it later this evening
yes i did the whole thing start to finish .
i do n't think so , it 's in fstab
hmm ?
what ?
now that i know the ssh command runs as root . i can work around it
ok , so have you setup a site definition in apache to point at that web root ?
screensaver ? you mean the brigness and lock menu ? tobias [ l ] , i do love unity ,
one line can specify multiple times . look at your /etc/crontab file for the format . in the hour column
feel free to clean the silo
no , i an online 10:00 to 17:00 so 7 hours
you should ask kaleo during the week ...
have n't tried that
we ( server team ) will just want a qa ack from you in the bug when we have something
or then get something like a cloud service to port through
i guess this technology is faster
try switching to root and do it
yeah , the plasma guys will sort it out . but i 'll stay on lts even on desktops in
better to install ubuntu drivers from additional drivers section
like the application on the old versions of ubnunu
details matter
well , it 'll fool the train into working . having changelog entries that do n't correspond to actual releases
it seems as if the boot menu only lists 8 entries , so ubuntu never showed up even though it
have you ever looked at memory management on arale and krillin ? on krillin everything seems to add up fine
click framework list on the device shows it already
if you 're using utopic , you prefer out of date
there tutorials are better than gparted , imo , since cli 's are universal ... one sec .
i just had a look at the code and is clearly a bug in the code
i 'd do it by hand if i were you .
select the drive that has the efi partition , such as /dev/sda /dev/sdb etc . and double click on the
you using hexchat :3
yes
the seed change
i will be afk for some time now . so just ask the channel with details again and others can
let my friend aq2 in peace right now !
fun times !
eish !
# 222 is the same as # 221
i guess linus will howl if lutomirski starts breaking user space
it means to redirect both standard out and other output like errors
weird . let me try with setting the unity scale factor as well
thx
lol !
if you ca n't even get these steps working , android development is not for you .
i found a session auto saver
yeah , better to force
are you dual-booting ?
he bought an android bq aquarius e4.5 and expects to just be able to flash ubuntu on it today
it is : )
no different
that 's nothing to do with ubuntu support . looks like an ascii motd file that 's all .
ah - just skimmed the question and did n't see that bit . fair enough
command line , so the tty you can get to - get the wired lan up then do-release-upgrade again
fix-pause is building in silo 26
extendvolumes and activate windows still use `` windows '' ?
then you wo n't have xscreensaver .
things i learned .
you 're running the script from your pc ?
it should work same on the device as well ... what window size do you have on desktop ?
patches are welcome ; - )
umm , let me quickly check ( its a workstation so when i purchased it i was only interested in
well i have a few backports to wrap up , then we have to start debian merges ...
keys ?
not promising : `` lib/deprecated.c:142 : int audit_rule_syscallbyname ( struct audit_rule *rule , '' ( deprecated ! )
is that a regression or some new code in the nearby scope
woah !
i 'd rather have something i can maintain though and be 100 % sure every device on my network is
it is clear in the sense that it reports all the locations where it looked for the header . it
i found the repo by running that the 'ls -al ' command
done : ) sorry i did n't notice that earlier
you go around the city leaving traces of the fact that you were present ... . and then it 's
no - too late
so then try adding `` availability-sets-enabled : false '' in your env.yaml for that environment and bootstrap again ( it
righto
hold shift at boot to enter grub
the name of a group
it 's run when not offline .
but is it possible without copy ?
seems someone else has encountered difficulty .
at least i wanted to think that was possible with normal -- to support
yeahp . it 's the manual install bit that would have broken it . cause we get the install list
ask the person who installed it ?
fastboot and secureboot ? from where would i have disabled those ?
try to install dropbox again
actually , i just realized that charm changes mean this 'll be a bigger rollout than simply pulling trunk into
sorry for not mentioning it earlier .
why is what hot ?
yup : ) so ... how do i get the url when my app is started ?
we were n't talking to you
fix your filesystem . then mount it .
the new wily version
well you could try grabbing 14.10 if that 's an option
i uploaded beagleblack.canonical btw
stop asking about vmware , we do not support that .
so can you help me to configure/use devilspie ( if it 's fine by you ) ?
yes , i manage autopkgtest myself , it 's not ci managed
i meant to ask in brusselles , what was the editor you where using , at first it seemed like
: )
i still have it as a google doc
- glade ( 3.18.3 = > 3.14.3 )
oh , i see
what 's confusing me is that shows dmi2.0 as the interface from the xeon , where as i thought xeons
no new release found
yes
and you 're totally fine with regards to a dist-upgrade ?
alright ill quick restart
is it running ?
hi
did you remove that other rule i had a while ago ?
that 's why i `` jumped '' last week onto getting this property in as that eliminates that issue :
i have n't dug into it myself , and only have other linux machines running smb to test again .
yes , but its a place to start from , as it contains the functions to interface with the pebble
cool - is that an lgtm or a vote of confidence ?
it 's already a very weird process from everything else , but that 's the only sane thing i can
it stopped detecting secondary screen
is there a list of socs that are good for multiplat with dtb upstream . ?
too much climbing ?
in brief , you should use addresses
nice to see you here as well . you 're going to enjoy test writing : - )
oh and just rebuild that one , not the whole silo ; - )
how do i check that ? this is my first time using efi
ca n't wait : )
it does n't look like there 's a provider method for this ( that i can see ) , can
i bet its not even set to boot from pxe
because of that thing we talked about on pm a few months ago : )
double posting , or cross posting is usually not recommended . but , it 's your soup : )
there is no code in the charm that changes passwords in rabbit , but it would ignore a change triggered
but does n't ubuntu use systemd ?
that 's expensive given i have to resinstall most apps
did you see what i was saying before ?
it is because if someone whos never seen or used android ca n't use android 5 , then of cause
apparently you 're not the first person with this issue on that particular release .
not official part of the sdk yet . just a class that gets copied around a lot
commented
hmmm system settings has a section for `` gestures and shortcuts '' , you can set , about 3 types
pastebinit /etc/apt/sources.list
you encrypted data within windows , did you ?
so this was the issue of where it 's refusing to connect to any network , still ?
k ; gparted , as advised , to the resue .
this drive does n't have smart
the dependency generation script we use needs a tweak
my digital ocean server is also like that and wanted to maintain here , is that a good practice ?
it depends on online content
ubuntu version ?
maas does n't allow that
lol
oh , lol
: d
i attached the a config file to reproduce with latest git rev
looks like component.oncompleted is not the signal i want
you can just copy and paste it in paste.ubuntu.com
worth trying but may i suggest you install the de only for now ?
ok
very standard . installed from 14.10 image this morning
okay , so the next thing to try is system-image-cli -vv without the -- dry-run . that 'll end up
in the normal case it passes with the lower bound
do you have a question ?
or , is it broken now ?
i dont ' have my laptop with me right now to chek
the issue with notifications through juju is arbitrary delays from hook exec queue
yes it needs to be unmounted . what is the problem you are trying to fix in the first place
i 'm searching for the problem : )
ubuntu 14.04.3 lts
if you are ubuntu ... .
lol : )
fwereade pointed that out to me the other day , i thought we had one for just restarting , but
be prepared to have to jump onto a live session and restore the mbr .
huh , good idea . i 'm gon na check that and see what i can do on my end
yes , simply called `` website ''
hmm , that does n't sound like the same thing
im hitting alt tab and i accidentally remove everything
waiting for slangasek to be up and get status on the channel changes
i thought you were gaming
ok. can you point to the bit in ubiquity that creates the 'oem ' user so i can be sure
let me spin it here then
but you can not use it to transfer files to windows , since there is no openssh server on windows
light green - > line that has been changed ( the new version ) or added
so if you had a phone that had arm , and you wanted to test the app , you would
move your mouse around
it could be permissions .
the really horrible archaisms ( sha-1 only ) are out of the way now , but it 'd certainly be
account properties
if you have any issues just ping me
what is the output of `` apt-cache policy libgles1-mesa '' ?
maybe save me for when others do n't have the necessary experience to reviwe the code ?
e.g . 1234 can be either a passcode or passphrase
no worries : )
they are integrated with snappy : )
pretty good for me . we went to germany to spend time with relatives for the new year . got
i 'm still on vivid ... perhaps this is a new ( wily ) nouveau issue
just fix committed if it 'll be in the next 1.25
you should n't need a launcher for a java app - just launch it
if you give me an existing build then i can possibly feed it to my local setup and see if
no , these are just missing dependencies
we both asked him about the apparmor trigered rebuild
here 's some info on the current tones : bug 1239612
let me have a look tomorrow . if we do n't use it for something important , then of course
looking
i do n't have bluetooth - i 'll try the other port ^^
maybe i can *reserve* either the reviews or the `` subset of tests '' for tomw , subset would enable
yeah , apparently i 'm sure i did it with that previous upload , but someone it did n't get
mhh weird it complains the files are the same , which are not
ok now if everyone is tired its ok
so u suggest i try installing that and then install ubuntu again ?
removed image
14.04 is long term support = 5 years . .10 = 9 months
laptop-mode-tools is removed right ?
no , i do n't think so . that says `` starting 2008 ''
the debug package
how to diagnose if drivers for wireless are detected by system ?
not really .
^
what 's the best way to aproach this ? it sounds like you 'd make an empty folder with just
i am testing again now ...
hence my hunting
lyndel @ lyndel-inspiron-6000 : ~ $ ls -l /dev/mmc
got time now ? we could play a game
ah , so you work for system76 ?
otherwise train 's always gon na find new commits
code plz ?
but i have to agree that my /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00cdmountpoint still points to /media/cdrom
tell it not to submit the report , and dismiss it
no wonder i cant locate the nick
you might be confused from those `` install ubuntu/linux '' apps for android which actually only run a chroot
i take advise well no sweat : p
find bugs , not cause them > : d
i 'd also test setting your nic to ignore ipv6 and see if that fixes it
from putty ?
the cable is new and it renders the image fine
ah efi install , backup your data then just delete everything .
so you ran `sudo apt-get install -- reinstall unity` and `sudo apt-get install -- reinstall ubuntu-desktop
doing it that way , for me , gives me exactly the same as the pastebin i sent earlier
depends resolution does n't apply to third-party scripts
mpt mind filing a bug for the change ?
yes , i can do that..so in that case html code wouldnt work , either..why then does everyone add codes
actually , lets back up further - did you get far enough to install or does it die too quick
can i block arp broadcast by the way ?
that would mean removing the call self._patch_mediascanner_home ( content_dir , mediascannerpath ) in your _create_empty_music_library ( )
run this `` sudo apt-get update & & install pastebinit '' *then* `` lspci | pastebinit ''
if you look to the dash you can see there are a bunch of those
yes
any chance we could get it targeting ubuntu-personal as well ?
i expect there will be some post install hardware configuration needed since a lot of autodetect stuff wo n't happen
nope
sinzui , tried adding a mongod executable on the new path just in case
so you 're installing amd graphics drivers with the hope to control cpu speed ...
okay , did you file a bug ?
have you removed any installs or partitions lately ?
i would n't say whatever is causing the above error is `` an issue in cross-building ''
i wish i was part of the team before this idea flourished : - )
and what if we get bad code again ? why ca n't there be a unit test failing then ?
still easier to grab multiple diffs than make our own
hehe
do you want me to re-upload ?
ah of course !
your applications are not filling up your home disk to the tune of 240gb
ping 8.8.8.8
maybe there is the way to simulate this buttons actions in terminal and check what will be the response ?
mine just uses me as a bed
ie . its more like a container on machine 0 has 10.10.0.1/28 and a container on machine 1 has 10.10.1.1/28
sure , and sil2100 can help if i 'm already away at that point
i should open an upstream report
someone broke it again
might be interesting to try mounting it r/o , to see how that fares
not what i mean at all - i 'll be sorely pissed off if the same people end up doing
ot nvidia-346 ( if that shows in your additional drivers list )
its the same ide , but with ubuntu plugins
ok
which graphics card for starters
your pass is compromised
uniter tries to download a charm , fails out , gets restarted in 3s , by which time the proxysettingsupdater
at the end , ro quiet splash $ vt\_handoff
ignore me
i do n't think so . i have not seen any demos of this quite yet .
describe everything what you 've done , but one thing is still paying my attention
do people use 1 hdd divided for 2 oss ?
alright , i can do that . would apt-get install -- reinstall do the trick ?
if only i understood any of it , lol
any idea why silo 21 is trying to build gst-libav1.0 first when its debian/control specifies that it must build gstreamer1.0
^ : )
fair point
there are other options , though
it seems to have recovered , possibly
do u use gpt partition ?
there is an upstream fix coming for that which is appplied to our 4.2 kernel in the ckt ppa
because flash is a very very bad peace of software
the approach i use is the `` equivs '' tool . it allows to create your own packages easily .
great , but we are now drifting into off-topic .
just small fixes no large changes
well , should have failed form yesterda
hi
it happens when screen gets locked .
the intention was that the new input functions were already out
hmmmmm . i 'm not entirely sure i understand , but i 'm saving everything you just said .
ungood , and apt-cache says what ?
because it was n't one they created , there are solutions , and not everyone owns a 750 ti ...
can you paste the exact error plz ?
unfortunately most windows programs nowadays rely on .net and common language runtime , which is implemented on linux via the
no problemo , i 'd do more but i 've just fired up a tv episode \o/
that 's another solution -- i 'm fine with that -- less bugs : ) but i had assumed this
should be available for all
it is , but the base autopilot.testcase class you import inherits from that . which as you mentioned was n't
yes thats a global solution . but if you 're the only person on the computer and always want private
it 's pretty short
when i had 8gb i had 8gb swap and didnt use it from what i noticed . but now i
chip : idt 92hd663c3/65
so what howto you were following ?
type alsamixer
file a bug and with that i 'm going to bed
just bitten us
no
ok , try sudo cp /boot/efi/efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi /boot/efi/efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi.backup
i see ...
in the terminal , type the following : f , i , r , e , f , o ,
yes , numerous times
anyway ... if you can check the logs , that would be a great place to start .
your massive array of disks on btrfs
yes , i did all those changes yesterday
yeah i know
please see above
actually i ca n't land to charm-helpers though
seems like i can
that does n't tell you which machine is using any specific subnet
any other nginx config files being read that might be conflicting ? it sounds to me that it has already
has n't changed , lp : ~ubuntu-mate-dev/ubuntu-seeds/ubuntu-mate.vivid
which is where ? i got some netbeans folder down here shown by nautilus
first , i 'd probably move the blog there .
no clear maintainer afaik , people only touch it when they have to .
installed testdisk.. it is scanning the hdd now
it 's a meaningful way to contribute . : d
it already has ubuntu 14.04 loaded on the new one
can you just run trisquel live to test it first ?
may i know the reason ?
do you know who daniel j bernstein is ?
generaly read only . i remount rw to add gdbserver to /usr/local/bin then switch back
no rush ... i 'm digging into it but drawing blanks so far
it did not do anything
i 'm under the impression policy is to use ~/bin/ for custom stuff .
strange that you were n't , since you had access to the spreadsheet
the bigger question becomes , though , why things are breaking with that assumption in play .
can you 'adb shell cat /tmp/recovery.log|pastebinit '
leaving the rest open , as i assume you have plans to pull in more later .
that does not fit
i compared the last 3 greeter files to my working laptop , also runing 15.10 and they were all the
lovely , i 'll get that uploaded after lunch
there is no quick fix
no
some manufacturers do n't include the module , or only provide a limited shell , but because uefi is extensible
yeah , aisrael is experiencing it atm
ah , does oxide have that as well ?
open a terminal : lspci -k|grep -a2 vga
not necessarily
/usr/bin/env : node : no such file or directory
it is done .
i tried contacting him directly , but got the same rejections
i do that because i do n't want the mails to be hosted at someone else 's mercy . i
can do
he 's probably spent several million dollars of his personal money on flavors at this point
be sure that you know what you 're doing when messing about with partitions tho
np
you can try apt-get install -- reinstall
ioria2 : ok i will buy
then apt-get install -- reinstall xserver-xorg xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-video-radeon xserver-xorg-video-ati fglrx fglrx-core libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri
or join the mailing lists
at the moment im using kaffeine it will start to work then stop all of the sudden
good to get my photos and music directories sorted out
you can use tab completion to enter the filename .
you need the delegate , because the popover needs a reference to the button that it should be pointing to
if you have shell access to your phone , maybe attach the syslog and other relevant bits ?
i am testing ww ( daily build ) on my virtualbox .
xcursor naming is a big hot mess
right , we 'll probably do something 'special ' for putting the header in a page , but still we
gnome-tweak-tool / dconf
because , honestly , postfix is very easy to configure via dpkg-reconfigure . i get the distinct feeling that you
all italian : /
im starting to think ... the server generates an event and sends it to the android layer
you 'll have to audit all the patches
that will re-apply the rules on an existing device , i. e. synthesize a `` change '' event
not the source registry
thx , i will have to check that channel out
if the debug message was n't there does n't that imply the signal was received and it just did n't
how you launching ? upstart or trying to get it under gdb ?
lol sorry , misread nicknames
a line in chkrootkit -q
if your test suite is python , then i still think it 's much easier to use .start_session_bus ( )
ok , that makes sense . so we want ( hd1 ) to also show ( hd1 , gptx )
1.5k commands is too early ?
is there a readme or install file in the folder ?
after that relogin the user and try again
you must 've been asked that like 100 times now , sry
i 'd have to know more about what this puppet stuff was doing and the goal , but charming is
so i ca n't really relate . but in your case skype is n't so bad : d
looks like you missing some boot stuff in windows , did you resize windows with the installer ?
apps could do that , we 're delivering the events to them anyway
but right now i cant make comercial ... with my store i will send flyers
yep good idea
optimising for network issues ( especially in our own dc ) leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
so when the header 's actions are active ( i.e . shown on teh page ) the shortcuts should be

rypervenche is this relevant to the channel at all ?
what releases is it going from , and to ?
in my bios i can move them up or down or just select one to temporarily use as the first
is that expected , i did n't assume this is restricted information
unless you wiped the device
i was thinking there 'd be a better way than to remove those but if no one else can provide

so this is your first akademy then ?
you can put a crunchbang or she bang line at the top of scripts on unix systems is that what
try to find a way to start with add-ons disabled . private mode do n't do that .
if you can fix it , you 'll be my hero xd
yes , `` packages_to_rebuild '' is a misnomer , it means `` act upon only these packages ''
will take a time and try
switch vts to a terminal and log in there ?
the bootstrap is failing : `` bootstrap failed , destroying environment ''
plop is a life-saver in those situations . you load it on a disk , it 's a super-minimal bios

jgdx was interested in phonesim
the most recent kernel available via aptitude ?
get the ubuntu .iso
hahaha
someone with a similar bug in the past has suggested that adding `` pcie_aspm=force '' to the kernel boot options
give me a pastebin of the dmesg command
but it would also be nice to look at why it does n't work , if it 's not working
which we wouldn # t do in the `` aging out '' scenario
how big is the controller cache ?
run a `` sudo update-grub '' and paste the output after its ended to a pastebin , please
is there a non-smartcard way to trigger gpg1 to ask for a pinentry , perphaps to rule it out ?
no big deal , just wanted to see what happened ... surprised me to get an email saying it was

right , you just said `` i need a reconfig on silo 002 ( line 13 ; yet anohter one
but i do want it to use the dns for vpn and it was not showing up
then do the install
not necessary , let 's just go full cycle here
great ; i have a build from a couple of days ago , so i 'll push that up somewhere
i would look and see if one has been created..
so what 's up ?
just choose whatever makes you happy , and we 'll copy that style . the things that are important for

gsettings ?
and if you can work out costs i can apply and see if community fund will pay for your travel/accomodation
let check the source , i wonder if there is something funny here
that was aptitude , not apt-get .

yea it works fine
the only line that mentions memory says : `` [ 1.974685 ] [ drm ] memory usable by graphics device

it is ! i dd the image onto the sd card

huh , weird
good luck mate , install preload also

it 's a magic variable whose value is the current pid

how can we help you ?
i thought that was what i was doing : )
bzr branch lp : ~barry/+junk/repotools
yep
strike that : )
that 's not what i call a theme manager ; it requires mono just to use it - it was
we wait for 200 bytes - which is quite a lot
nah , it 's not wrong , just the way i described it is wrong ( it 's src-headers ,
in which case you can just start with an initial binding on previous

i tried to do it using mouse but i ca n't make the screens appear in the same position

but afaik a userspace sw open /dev/watchdog
no , it does n't , i 'm just making that security concern of mine known - you 'll either
yep , 1.24.0
i use the following features for games : duel and werewolf
sure .
what browser are you using ?
which wo n't be there when you leave , so boot will fail
you 'll have a /dev/mdx device representing the raid device
you are correct .
then work from there to get it to load the gui properly
arm64 -- will do
you should have a folder called netbeans-version in your /home/username folder
done , still no errors
the wine application db is a database of applications and help for ! windows programs that run under ! wine
any info on that ?
right , so you 'd want a britney instance which tries to land the ppa ( `` unstable '' )
no
why ca n't you do what you did before ?
maybe , but the drivers are still in the repos
it depends .
ok cool , let me try
so that i do n't get left wherever they 've cded to
no idea what you 're talking about
`` mail or list ''
ready for packaging if you are are a lose end ( but it 's the weekend remember to relax )
all that has is a python file
no , dont use citrix
i ca n't reproduce this
/me looks back ...
i 'll never leave ubuntu-desktop : )
hmm ? sslv3 is beyond broken ...
huh ?
the store id is what was missing , and is there now
look in your `` help '' menu for help from deepin . this is ubuntu .
keep in mind in this stage , things can still break
the terabytes of data
just ask
yes
did n't see it before , drop your build dir

there is an easy way to communicate online that governments ca n't even hack into .

then created the vm for maas , and for the nodes , attached to this network
probably 15.04
but maybe it should be 'stateless ' rather than stateful - what do you think ?
just wondering if 64 bit versus 32 would be better . and since i 'm at work it will take

this is ubuntu support channel
could n't understand : (
that 's not silly , that 's why we are here : p
also have one more sound card selectable- `` card : hda nvidia '' `` chip : nvidia gpu 71 hdmi/dp
yes , i do `juju destroy-environment local` and `sudo lxc-destroy -- name leecj2-local-machine-1` then `sudo lxc-destroy -- name juju-trusty-lxc-template` then
note that the rest of the world probably is running systemd in the initramfs and does n't have such problem
grab a frame from it , and fire the frame off via some udp-based protocol , e.g . rtp
tried it out yet ?
well super sad face , i see `` net init skipped '' on boot
no problem
meaning that they actually refer to a valid revision
check your channel . this is ubuntu not fedora/redhat
psu and it gave me placeholderse on the ram
looks like they have it building but says there are still potentially critical problems
btu when we change , we do n't reset it
see the software center for the list of options . the preference of others should be absolutely irrelevant to you
not a big deal , i found some instructions to create ltsp under ubuntu , but its a little tricky
: - )
a little bit using the rpi2
page.tools is a deprecated property . please use page.head instead .
even better : )
ah : /
fabric is even simpler , imo : )
ls /usr/bin/*actions-config-tool*
ah yes ...
he only had a part time contract sadly and didnt tell anyone the results
ok i 'll move it , hang on
afaik you can not run some upgrader to have lubuntu afterwards , the difference is mainly the window manager ,
supports hdmi with max . resolution 4096 x 2160 @ 24 hz / 2560 x 1600 @ 60 hz

it 's even worse when you do n't like marmite trust me
matching versions are required ; they are often different , so the script can not assume that .
booting to cd now . what software should i use in the lice cd ?
compiling yourself is n't a typically supported action , so it 's unlikely someone will reply
currently working on the notification dialogs .
did you keep the screen on ?
everything is centered on user interaction
amazon returns what it expects for all the signing pieces , we can compare those to the debug output from

thnx for the review , sure i will add the example .
yeah , make your script return something like `` a=5 ; b=6 ''
well , object pascal is n't that much different from c++ ; )

err , the two versions on the same ssd , or ?
i would use gpg

time is important in computers
done
i thought you said 12.04 ?
yes using ubuntu-device-flash from a laptop , are you familiar with how to do that ?
my apologies , ill fire some questions at you later on , going to dabble a bit more
then i assume you have a backup .
done much after the mini install + de install ?
it 's pushed
when exactly ?
and not helpful to the conversation , please go watch some hr videos
ah no worries
hmmmmmmm ok . i 'm just at the doctor , i 'll be home in a couple hours to dig
those cordova docs are exactly what i needed
haha , fair enough
is there an alternative ?
i am in /usr/src/myfolder
end of life
the only thing i get afraid is if i install php5.4 by source . many modules like sudo apt-get install
nice , i hope you have a great time off
cloud storage
too much crap
wave the branch at me when it 's up
so default juju in trusty/14.04 is currently 1.20.11 it looks like
there might be something to escalate here on our end .
how does the system behave with it off ?
or it may , as a project
i found another one look like the first link
yes
might it be relevant in the slightest bit to my plight ?
with pleasure
the source is 3,5gb , the target is close to 150gb
blimey - let me take a peek
but i have seen that happen to me before and i did n't get that crash iirc
way better help here in this area myself , faster anyway , let us know if you need . no
nope , i tried many things but could n't figure it out , it should cause any harm though
yeah now try nomodeset again *and* the flash drive
but no ui for it and set to show by default .
not entirely sure . i can try putting a file in it
/usr/bin/tarantool
it 's already mounted at /mnt
this has potential to impact of pxc and stuff right ?
should n't have to , should be backwards compatible
canonical specific public api patches
me too
well its a good job system is n't the default
it already does that stuff , i need a new hook to grab data from other commands
no wait first copy the service file to /etc/systemd/system/
cool , mterry ^
each portion of an ip address is 8 bits .
what should the version be ? 5.0~git20130712-0ubuntu8 ?
yeah
there 's a small conflict , please merge externalmonitor into it
different screens have different colour reproduction , if that 's what you 're asking
she got a xorg line from an arch wiki
yes using paypal . first time i tried . i am also having a weird selection box for paypal .
that snippet of your was very pythonic , btw
not much , but they might have to contact freenode staff , so it may take a little while .
yeah , that 's maybe good enough for now
good to see package testing set up for xenial : )
also - at the moment it 's a dummy test
hello-world
i guess it 's not an app problem but the compiz issue , well try this
quite some work , but just now i have a vm where stuff starts to work
and rsalveti 's trace should be from there
that would work
ok i did .. and ?
because it 's no longer supported .
those can now be used by themselves . and i like to re-use them in the header
here
it has modem
ok , now can you `` pastebinit $ { home } /.xession-errors ''
usb wont work because its a virtual linux machine ...
i know
how pressing is this ?
does the additional drivers offer any other drivers ?
you can not even override , it 's final , ai n't it ?
are you trying to add a 3rd display ?
no worries , i appreciate your help !
i guess i figured the charm could be retrieved on the fly when requested . but *shrug* .
great be sure to read that wiki , you may have to hit the bios
well , sure , but you wo n't see ia64 or sparc on prod because we hide arches that do
you already tried that post , you said ..
yea basically its the ubuntu openstack installer renamed from cloud-installer to openstack package
my tab completion is not doing well
it seems static to me
ok ... i will try a purge of those files then
that 's not so bad then
u know how to do it ?
without .
the minimal cd image is very small in size , and it downloads most packages from the internet during installation
also i have two fixes for linux-zfs to fix the two ftbfs 's
dpkg -- get-selections | grep linux-image | nc termbin.com 9999
no . i prefer to help you with yours , if you need a hand .
sory , hyperbole ... but just not a fan of not-type-safe code
see my last paste - looks as if i have the stock click rather than ppa
apt-cache policy packagename lists available versions of the package , in the order which they would be installed
take the token that returns , and on a computer where you have network and push checked out , do
tyvm : d
chromium is just the open source version of chrome
yup , i 've read through most of those docs and they 're really helpful , just a bit stuck
`` merge '' .
no you dont
so , if anything , i 'm thinking the ideal is ( 1 ) watcher sends unit list ( 2
good point , i guess that would 've been the next follow-up ; )
there is a werid bu where /var/log changes ownership
the train takes the source package name , not the lp project name - and in your aethercast branch the

phew : )
*silent
im kinda reluctant to depend too hard on features of the debian packaging tools for this .
like i said . off topic . take it to one of those two other channels now please , i
this will be a little technical . please start by running `` mount '' and pastebining the output .
indeed , nice anyway
no
yeah , but maybe impress is n't heavy and if it is n't , it 'd be a nice gain
type sudo umount /mnt
see # ubuntu-desktop from about 1hr30m ago
yes . the web panel shows i 'm connected to only 1 network
no , apt-get reports it , it does n't cause it . the way to test is to manually fetch
when we get this figured out , we 'd love your feedback on the project
oh !
run apt-get install -f
zol is n't really stable as in stable . i 've used it in production for a year without issues
i updated it since
so any ppa is interfering with that packages ?
it 's ok - we 're talking specific issues currently : d
i believe you 'll find the reason for that in /var/log/xorg.0.log
what are these for though ?
juju ssh mysql/0 ... or juju ssh ipaddressofmachine , both give the same result
it does . it 's there , but there 's no label
that does not make it on-topic here
you using nvidia ?
do you get the grub menu when you hold shift after the bios screen ?
ok i have just finished the installation and booted lubuntu , how can i check what has been installed from
me either , but that package looks a bit newer than the one you mentioned ; - )
v , t and p - please
huh
it should have been /dev/sda
like most of our apps they are customer related as they prep for launching big devices : p
7 or 8 ? legacy boot or efi ?
nice idea , i`ll try it .
hmm ... still nothing
ok : ) i 've committed new things on my store_data branch , let me do a proper mp on
lsb_release -a
nope , publishing happening today
pong
you mean the refit ?
ah , maybe for an os drive , do n't expect so much for a sole storage disk
ifconfig ?
sorry im very new , but i know i didnt change anything
as you are root in recovery console , you have to run `` passwd < your username here > ''
for the locale you 're in
that 's not how it works .
i hav etraces in alarm destructor , the alarm that is supposed to be returned is not deleted : /
i got it through the latest update : (
let me just try and read ken 's mind
it was a simple fix , barely test worthy
it 's not something i 'm searching . i 'm searching for a tool i can configure from cmd line
hmmm damn : /
i 've just pulled trusty to test it
i had something else in mind : d
downloading
yes
yeah cause it 's worked fine in my first hand experience , i 'm going to let it go now
it needs installing vivid then convincing it that vivid+1 is released to see if there 's notification
yeah but from where
the directory .config/touchpad-indicator is not present by default
ok , good to know
$ snap_app_data_path
uuh
is that ok ?
oh right . so you 've got 1 pr up against the lxd feature branch right ?
i just approved the branch in silo rtm/20 . sorry for that : /
need text above that
does that mean i can sudo apt-get them now , instead of manually selecting specific packages with our little script
how is babby formed ?
just saw the failure myself
i 'm using a mobile device because my laptop does n't have any gui . can i send over an
: (
blimey , so is it just my .conf file then ? though that looks fine from what i can make
alright , that might be a problem
which lugs have you contacted about ubucon ?
will do
but i do n't really recommend using that , it 's more hassle than it 's worth . if you
neat . i pinned my drivers to 340 to stop things breaking . maybe i 'll chance 346 , but
where is maize ?
is that persistent though ? i thought export was temporary ?
you crazy .
it is currently running .
monkeydust : the performance are really different : nearly 3gt/sec for esata3.0 but less than 1gt/sec for usb3 . the
alright . so , just so we 're both clear , this last ban was for a month . if
pendrive is the official way , we wrote a howto ...
and this seemed like the fastest way to do it
rtfs
did n't quite get that ... huh ?
it uses nocloud dataosoruce
if nothing lands soon , we 'll be strict and wo n't accept any silo after the gates are closed
they may be `` bad '' for opensource ( debatable ) , but they do provide oem linux drivers .
just firing up random commands will not repair your grub .
^
looks lovely
i 've been working on it for close to 2 weeks
so atm there is no backend making use of it . however , pstolowski will update the mediascanner scope next
any results ?
for the custom , it has to decompose into things with manifests and versions
what error ?
it 's helped along a bit by mobile users , 30 % of their traffic from 4g cells is over
can you explain what happens exactly ?
also , i feel really uncomfortable downloading executable code without having any way to check that the code is legit
yay : d ok , re-do the pastebinit : )
we moved over to cloud.qa.u.c , for the last release so that the cloud images did n't take over the
i 'll be able to test that as soon as this iso is down
sata cable on port1 ?
but it 's not `` down '' down ... some things are working sometimes . it 's a strange/flakey issue
did you try with the nomodeset kernel option ?
no , the theme breaking is too much
maybe ? its about ubuntu making systemd-sysv a requirement
so maybe an hour or two
ask the channel though and someone might know
what kind of information is the arduino sending ?
looks good
can try searching that with your ubuntu version to see if there is some known bug maybe a workaround or
`` to the os '' ?
i could try to `` steal '' some pixel from the side margin , but i feel like the problem
how do i tell ?
sorry no tee
point me to it please
you do get lightdm ?
have you tried it ?
really ! i need something to run better on my older laptop , kerbal space program is getting a little
mmhmm , see above when i typed ! nomodeset to someone else , you may end up needing that same
yes , as soon as we get all that , we can make a better site : )
no , it does n't . write some complete before/after examples in a pastebin : )
your customer will send the to individuals or use for network ?
that 's all i see too , but it *is* soothing .
so sort a happy accident
and , lets use today 's standup to agree where our ota package will be . we should have made
i doubt anyone would get very much objection from the gtk maintainers about that
how did you fix the reply-to with the mailing list ?
i 'll look into it ... are we tied to the existing branch name xmir-1.17 too ?
ask the real question
wait , there is quiet splash , my bad
i see : ) - so maybe we see more and better arm device support for snappy soon
regardless of the way you install ubuntu , you have to install the nvidia-352-updates package on your system after the
not in the python-django charm i 'm using
why ? its what you told ln to do
sounds like a mutexmanager to me
have you tried the boot option : i8024.reset or i8024.irqpoll or i8024.nomux
for example , i 'm running hexchat 2.9.6 , which is what is used in xubuntu 14.04 . but the
interesting , ok , so juju_context_id might be set ?
yeah oracle sucks
it does not help , teh model wo n't be reloaded
do i have to bump the pkg version each time ?
that ought to be fixable by editing ubiquity-dm . maybe it 's not doing quite the right thing to bring
in gmail , it does n't work/
can you pastebin the output of `` mount '' on the host live session ?
really o_o
i had looked at that , do you know why the ci failed ?
yeah , you 'll be great to use ubuntu
what is `` -s -t 1 '' ?
for long-lived processes , inside a loop , a time.ticker is better
nothing
cool : )
yes , it 's weird . i do n't get why it 's returning the current version . it happens
it will happen again if people create requests that already existed in the spreadsheet .
so i wonder if it 's just blocking me for some reason
is there only one partition on it currently ?
or use nova directly for hot-adding
do you have bad sectors on your disk , yes/no
that sounds like the windowmanager is crashing . but better ask the lxle guys what they changed so it crashed
so what do i do then ? ?
but they share the same hw address
umm ... system-a ? partition # 3 iirc
not at all ; although if you find a kernel option you 'd add it in /etc/default/grub so that the
looking at that web-page ( i had to use developer tools to kill all those popups/overlays ) - definitely suspicious
type ls -ld /home/user/.bash_aliases
where can i find the source of the ported version of twrp multirom to oneplus one ?
i 'm not in london . i do n't think i 've been there since the last desktop sprint i
if you have some other power managing script like tlp , laptop-mode etc they will clash
try an ecm ( enterprise content management ) solution like the open source alfresco
and follow the wiki install
oh , wait . maybe i found it .
review , and maybe fight or side with tedg : -p
where is the `` show hidden icons '' option ?
yeah , fair point
excellent . we all want more upstream glib bugs
i feel like that 's a bug . : p
np . understandable . the attached file count is growing on that bug ; - )
hmmm .
there might be more though
should the upload directory not be 777 ?
which would make the extra view/ dual view look like pocket change
i 'm very happy for you ...
why do you need systemd ?
the thing that would mkdir /tmp/snaps was the wrapper , not the launcher
probably
weirdly the web apps open fine it 's just the browser which i 'm assuming will also be a main
did it work out of the box in 12.04 ?
all the time .
'cos it stops immediately in the network stack
going to push it then i guess , it 's not like it could possibly get any more red
i have some vendors that require it , although i have ssh for the ones that have moved into this
oh and the auto setup of encrypted volumes
ok ? so that should install node , whats the problem ?
hmmmm i have a blue flashy light on the system but i 'm not getting an actual connection show up
yeah , noticed at eod yesterday , so my brain must have been sleepy
open a browser , like firefox
package does not exist in ubuntu/debian repos
i 'm assuming what it does is makes compiz `` redraw '' the screen every time there 's a change
if its such an emergency , you can quickly grab your programs via web
it all depends on the app developer
the spec says `` series ' thpugh
the kernel ml is kernel-team @ lists.launchpad.net , right ?
see line 75
i am checking out this right now
well if you are n't , feel free to edit it
seems like anyone who ended up on 1.23 could have trouble getting off it
just did and it 's still not loading . and we 've gotten to the point it does n't crash
yeah i agree with you , i 've spent a lot of time reading up on these issues over several
the issue started when python3.4 hit -updates , so a couple of weeks
both powershell and cmd.exe , i believe
if they hit linus ' tree then we 'll likely pull them automatically for 16.04. if they do n't reach
test-requirements.txt for ceilometer needs gabbi ( ? ) and pyhon-elasticsearch ( in universe )
yuppiedo
that is what i figured . should i log a bug with kubuntu ? is that something that they would
i dont know , a standard blu-ray disc ?
i have n't tried the recory part yet just created a new /etc/hosts file : )
if you have taken the disk out , grub is untocched so will work fine
hey
did you see my comment about the environwatcher ?
anything would be more than me ... : - )
bug 1481717 , its short , i 'm hungry and gone now
didn work to get windows controls to the right ?
ouch , yeah i would 've gone with xubuntu on that
oh and is that the real confluency ?
for that process
does it get an ip ?
i did n't do enterprise stuff though , learned a bit of here , a bit of there
?

sudo dpkg -- remove -- force-remove-reinstreq -- force-depends with this command its forced to remove the package did it work
windows 8 is a horrid os that only lets you make eufi usbs
already did
you are eol on 14.10
i just found the info on the web , lots there on pepper in ff .
^
aha
it was a pleasure and i learn something new eveytime i read ur code !
when the purpose of blocking is so that we do n't layer onto broken code
although , i 've been wondering whether it should n't just be storage-changed ; collapse multiple attachments into one event
tnx
my issue was with firefox . i switched to chomium and it was fixed
well snappy in core does n't use this
what is the output of 'dpkg -l|grep ppa1 ' ?
there are no test cases for `` upgrade ubuntu mate ''
where would you put that line ?
ok , i 'll reconfigure it for you then
jibel : in /usr/share/locale-langpack/es/lc_messages/messaging-app.mo i do n't see any `` got it '' or `` swipe to reveal actions ''
so you are running ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 ?
like provide ppas .
why ?
if i am right displaylink works with on usb port , not on mhl .
try libsylph-dev
open firefox
no updates for example
where 's that ?
no `` preferring '' because of line 104
after what , try another reboot
should be rm -rf .zoiper ? ? ?
'debfoster ' will generate the list of top-level packages , ensuring the auto-install/remove dependency graph is maintained , too
i can successfully create a ws object
i 've just learned yesterday about the plans of abandoning software center in 16.04
we are having some server issues , its a known problem and we are actively trying to fix it .
it wo n't let me ssh back to my ethernet-connected devices on my router while i 'm on wireless
or use it in pre-release now if you like
xchat works just fine .
that wo n't mess with systemd ?
if you would tell me what `` pwd '' gives you i would know in that directory you are .
indeed , that would be good to land
so what exactly happens it just stops and does n't play ?
those are the raw systemcalls your app made
right ...
this appears to only impact utopic and newer hosts
imagebin is broken . but it wo n't stop you paste lines on paste.ubuntu.com
< /3
i 'm around , so whenever is good for you
heels . nope .
so yeah , sorry , i should 've merged mousepointer instead
yeah , it landed in vivid a while back , we had forgotten to backport it to rtm
there are 2 checkbox i should let them unchecked ?
yes , doing that is non-trivial even for experienced installer devs
not have bluetooth support : (
and your point is ?
more than likely graphics driver related
did i do that ? : o
not here valid
what 's supported as upgrade path ? trusty - > new backports and trusty+old backports - > new backports ?
ya . it was more exhausting than i thought
there 's no such thing as a simple manifold
that would be a great initial contribution : - )
i just had a go using the ubuntu sdk . a lot of stuff i 've never dealt with .
normally it does , yes . did it not do that when you installed ubuntu ?
sure , some helper functions can help ... but you do n't need thousands of lines of code just to
green
do you have an external mouse ( usb/bluetooth ) you can use until the trackpad issue is solved , that
its not intended to be a cheap desktop replacement . .its a project board that happens to have the facility
it 's just govts now like china or usa who can hack and get away with it .
did you manually configure the networking ?
lol
was that established ? it certainly seemed that way to me but i got the impression not everyone was convinced
i 'm having one of those days where i 'm chasing shiny things instead of doing the stuff i 'm
care to explain why i 'm keeping specific builds behind , that are not currentl in use ? even between
one of the developers says it is fixed in 0.5
with propietary drivers disabled it 's working
use `` python3 ''
broadcom corporation bcm43228 802.11a/b/g/n
ok
virtualbox-5.0_5.0.4-102546~ubuntu~trusty_i386
no , just my local one : )
but i would need some time to try to come up with a proposal
i do n't think it 's wrong
unity ... the standard one ... i have n't done anything fancy to this laptop
what are you pinging ? 'the domain ' is what ?
np
ok , then run the install command again ?
if possible i 'd try downgrading to 1.24.4 - this might be a regression
sorry for the misunderstanding : - )
run this in a terminal : watch -n 0.1 'cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i mhz '
ok
that external hard drive is not listed on gparted too
no worries . and i am wanting to eod myself .
ok : - )
no internet connection required
the only thing i can think of is that my laptop became quite hot in my bag because it did
screen.orientation is coming straight from qplatformscreen
you learned the rules after the very first ban
well , so , the system is implemented very specifically . snappy is n't handling that right
i remember i had to make sure that the new kernel headers are actually there .
hm , so it fails here :
distro patches are applied with quilt
i did not . how do i ?
do you mind if i send current trunk to staging without links fixed ?
actually more like 1m
the weird selection box for paypal , you mean the list of payment methods in the app ? there is
well
i recommend checking out the wordpress charm and seeing how it manages the database information , etc . you 'll
its common opensource quality
it does n't , try sudo umount /mnt/elements , then put other options like fmask=777 , dmask=777
for what purpose ?
once you 've found the device , depending on how it is connected to the pc , there are different
as www-data , yes .
new params to 2 apis were added
which was with me the whole time .
for the record ...
then you are not running ubuntu , are you ?
because i want stack traces so i can triage the errors i found by fuzzing
please , this is still a family-friendly channel
and on wily ?
if you really do need swap , it should be the last partition .
to make it short , you could add apt-add-repository to the apt package : )
26gb is too small for windows and something else
as fas as i can see the issue is reading the push notification in the nuntium side , can you
in particular , we 'll be sprinting in st julians , or `` san giljan '' , pronounced more --
getting better , you ?
no , it means `` linux works well with cameras that support the uvc standard ''
my fault : )
but before update to 14.04 it used to be ok , and untile this morning until i closed the lid
good idea
identifying the precise nature of an infection is often not a waste of time
i ask again , have you tested with the vesa driver ? or nomodeset ?
not yet
yes
and the github-style `` use this exact version , or else '' mentality is a security vulnerability nightmare . no
curious , do you know if the sdk works on unity 8 yet ?
not really
the changes that are causing almost all tests to fail also landed on ubuntu-rtm yesterday and we would need those
what happens if the build is kicked twice ? ^
it 's two ubuntu 14.04
ok ... . go back to the same menu , by holding the shift key , once at that menu
the back end is all the same , but the primary de 's are all heavily tested for each release
but your point is useless , because you ca n't boot ubuntu on maxwell cards without specifying nomodeset
well do
generally the load average is due to internal kernel waiting , so it does n't show up in any kind
you dont know the facts , so please dont talk like you do
i really do n't know what he was tring to find out , but i also think that the user
so what i can do to access the ubuntu laptop throuhg ssh
when publishing stuff from a silo , they land together in proposed
which device , which channel ?
oh right , i 'll go read my emails
do n't they point to the same place ?
i cant see the game to configure the settings , is there any other way
we 're not using networkd either .
i have a laptop and monitor connected with hdmi
cant you keep a backup an another media ?
^^ nautilus : idea ? recon we have no edid ?
can you assign yourself to this bug please ? the regression is already around for a couple of weeks
actually i tried but its not working , also tried to find some solution on web and finally asking help
i have a 3tb using esata dock station . works great
so many lines in lshw output
if i try to reboot this machine , i probably wo n't be able to talk to you anymore .
ok , so since kgeomap is n't built anymore , the gpssync plugin is n't either , so the icons
ok , got it
you tried dist-upgrade ?
maybe the iso is corrupted
pong
grab a beer : p
you threw me then i 'm thinking how is he scrolling to next week it only goes to sunday :
`` find /lib/modules -type f -name pl2303.ko ''
i tried but it didnt work out , i still ended up with 5.6
`citrain host-upgrade 0` more like
not really a supported issue , but unpack and hit the tor icon
also ... there was nothing interesting logged when it happened
make dir in /var/www/ that is owned by your user with group www-data which has rx rights ?
sounds okayish to me i suppose , since the phablet-tools are n't installed on our phones
i know many developers who like to play with autopilot
download on your host and scp
i do n't get the xrdp login gui in rdesktop with xrdp installed
cli
is there a reason why git- > bzr imports can not be made from git repos hosted on launchpad
umm ...
sorry for my ignorance but how do i do that ?
no what harms an ota ?
it 's not the icons which are the problem in 15.10 ...
why go to the extent to check for -- pid existence if just looping on each pid in the pidfile
tried a word release in play on linux , but it was problematic in my use context is all .
and then you removed dpkg ?
depends on what mint version you are : )
yes
ok . i have seen you have implemented the -t option , it works as expected here
it 's a video bug
i commented on the bug
if you 're using the live ubuntu , have you used gparted or some other tool to check the partition
i also stopped the acpid service , then ran it in the foreground with `` acpid -ddd '' and saw
sudo apt-get install synaptic
ok. cheers . ^_^
oh if you only just changed sata mode your windows install will bsod on boot , yeah
checking
sorting it right now
did you get info about this 2 bugs after kf 5.9 upgrade ?
i remember there was a mr from you that wanted to remove it from the seeds but it never got
i 'm not a user of it though .
yep
so you are not able to boot the install media ? have you been here with this before ?
jibel : ^- noticed by chance in p-m logs
best thing is to simply look at your ppa listing ... after a few minutes it should show the package
oh no really ? hah
yes ?
but what about uploading ? i would rather upload to debian to reach a wider audience but i do n't
we also have an issue related to that with videos
appreciate the help
also , it is a behaviour i have never seen , i wonder if it happens only for some operators/countries
the downside of interfaces everwhere ... figuring out what code is actually getting called is hard
good point . i 'll take a look at that when i get home
any particular software that you 're using ? a few details would help
ok , i 'll look into it
send me the patch , or file a bug report
black background ?
yes
so it 's something wrong with how the makefile is generated
could be a kernel thing also
well that sucks . is there a command to remove dangling packages like that ?
did you remove the additional sections ? the diff has changed and now i 'm confused : d
and it 's late for you , and i have to go soon anyway . let 's pick this back
sure , go relax and good night
yep
what version of ubuntu
i was waiting for you to do a stop/start
i would n't be concerned about using the rapid storage controller , personally . it 's not best practices ,
ok now you have to do the real thing to modify the file : sudo sed -i 's/nodisplay=true/nodisplay=false/g ' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop
always in theory : p
the nameservers ie
you upgraded from wich to wich ?
thumper and mramm have been pondering that
something new ? : )
excellent
how did you set the persistence ? an the final usb you expect .
i am checking what this one is
gained 5mb
you need libdvdcss no matter if you install vlc or any player
mh , adding maxsize does n't change unity behavior here btw
you can stop listing it .
the gl error is weird . does qtc still start ?
90s is the standard systemd timeout for start/stop commands
iptables are empty.. i 'm assuming that means everything is open . should i add an entry for my 10.10.11.0
random shots in the blue so you are occupied if nobody else replies : if nothing odd is in the

there is a lot of text

yeah , that 's true
because it is important , you should not be running a server if you do n't care to fix problems
i have n't .
i know , but i 'm afraid upgrade will broke my system
problem is from what i can tell the kubuntu package automatically has plasma 5 , kde-full appears to be plasma
then that 's not it
i do n't understand the remark about translators.txt not being in the patch . translators.txt is the output from a

internally a deploy becomes add-service , add-unit , assign-unit , add-unit-assign-unit , ...
gnome-maps
mate .
actually
no , just the deployer , but not through the gui
so i imagine that 's the case that you 're seeing it in the handler .
`/usr/bin/juju -- version` ?
ok tnx for feedback , good to know
like this ?
oh ?
yeah
there 's an upgrade to my phone ... doing that now
oh - did it not boot with systemd , and with some error `` your /etc/mtab is a file ''
mzanetti : well , it 's probably pointless anyway , the document viewer already does a great job at rendering
perhaps you can control that from the page that is hidden/visible ?
worth with them to sort out their scripts and dependencies then
ok one sec sorry
yes now leave and ask again in # # linux please .
to indicate they are unset
`` we release when it 's ready '' by and large , but we do aim for 15.04 , i.
indeed , was n't there error checking on the index before ? or am i misrembmering ?

when trying to use the xfce screenshotter , i 'm getting `` image type 'png ' is not supported ''

shrug
if you are on the tablet and tapped on the black area of the indicators ( away from the icons

do you have the events saved locally or is it shared with google calendar ?
sudo iwlist wlan0 scan|grep -i essid
are you likely to have a bit of time to make the necessary ddeb-retriever changes ?
yep one sec
hi : )
if you try to send a higher resolution the tv will dither and scale it
did you port that driver to 3.15 back then ?
phew , then my mind ai n't going : )
are you able to upload photographs to an image-sharing web-site ? if so , if/when you hit one of these
what does it mean it 's recursive ?
well , the thing is url-dispatcher needs appid as protocol
actually from what i can see , in that test no future is ever executed
well not generally .
what size is your /boot partition ? , which files are there that are not installed , taking how much
nah this is for a raidy-array
well strace says +++ killed by sigsys +++
does that env var help ?
power off the vm and check 3d acceleration is enabled under graphics
not yet , can do so in a bit
i do n't really understand that wikipage , which one should i download ? dabber , edgy , feisty.. etc
right
i guess if it vomits in dmesg with a very loud `` this is deprecated , enable /proc/foo=1 to temporarily

apple did
took much longer than i expected , especially that the importer is running every 5 minutes

thats typically how it starts right ? : )

paste the whole thing : p
a fresh install this morning did n't pull it in .
paste artifact ? ?
that was not it , but the issue is network configuration on ubuntu

i installed it this way : sudo add-apt-repository ppa : kilian/f.lux [ enter ] sudo apt-get update [ enter ]
you 're not able to run the live usb in uefi mode from refind ?
the best way to change that is to change the puppet config
is there a public link to the spec ?
you can verify that the process is still there ?
can you please give me a debdiff from the archive package and your current one ?
fyi , i tried adding `` goarm=7 '' to the service file manually and it did n't make a different

i tested it yesterday ~ 22:00 , are there any new packages since than ?
ohhh that w 'd be a problem . : /
are you sure you 're a member of that group
ok you can now push branches against lp : lxc-android-config
after that command i was going to run sudo usermod -a -g wireshark $ user
hah , go to sleep !
ok , that helps me visualise what we are working with . we 're talking about msdos3 here is that
i was asked by jibel to no approve further landings unless they are super `` critical ''
i figured , just wanted to make sure that we were all on the same page though .
no problem : d
with upstart , i 'm never sure whether unity8 picked up the env var or not
looking at your past few posts , i ca n't put together what you 're asking ...
yeah , -- target is for cross . do n't use it for native chroots .
just to be on the safe side , can you send me a link with open nginx bugs in trusty
ok , he must have used the api , unofficial
good for you
who makes the rules you adhere to blindly ; -p
it 's released .
it 's a war file
sorry , i was afraid of that : )
right , bit late for that perhaps though . we built off the lubuntu idea which has been around forever
`` first '' is set to `` true '' in proxyupdater.new ( ) when the worker is created
done : )
any ideas on this ?
i did this when i added 'snappy man ' : )
no those are completely unrelated
you 're a giant help , for sure !
it 's called sideloading ( your package will have origin : sideload )
you can try to check for updates if it 's there
can you echo $ desktop_session in a terminal
rsync
is there already a bug number for it ? should i file one ?
your welcome
it didnt partition my usb : )
i was trying to keep them limited in audience to avoid bikeshedding , and because they dealt with coding standards
... ... ...
it does ? i did something wrong then . it was n't working in my environment
ok , in the directory where you ran `` make '' etc
then i 'd suggest you set up a proper nameserver
sure , let me know if you get stuck etc
i 'm not . what 's your problem ?
oh right : )
which ubuntu 14 ? there are 2 ubuntus each year . and yes ubuntu is multiarch .
with server managment , and basically every professional server management i 've ever worked with , they always keep it

independent games , aka stuff that jaxonm does n't know about ; - )
sudo add-apt-repository ppa : hardware-certification/public
what video card device are you using
most everything works with 14.04

i 've added the ppa and done a dist-upgrade , it upgraded *some* xorg-related packages , but not many ...
fantastic , want a diff to review before i do something with it ?
but we 're not removing sync-monitor are we ?
he 's a troll . in case you missed it
i guess that would work
not sasl problem . i will pastebin output in a sec
no it 's for everything.. something must have broken it recently
comment as to why you set invalid though
pastebin sido fdisk -l please
but overlay support is already on
is that not the same thing ?
i see , those strings were translated by me , but probably the locale file was n't updated
there 's probably an italian channel for you .
authorized keys restricts access
can you also update the bug with the details of what you 've been discussing here , and any relevant
so how can we know its `` the bug '' ? or even solve it
these are not `` backups '' , though . they are `` snapshots ''
just keep ppa-purge handy at all times : d
okay ... . i ran printer detection but i 'll try the sane drivers .
the key , on line two
no
would run fine on there , if you do n't multitask a lot .
heard anything from voidspace ?
with a crap firmware tho
approved
sure it can , but konsole4 is not in our packageset so not by me
you 're doing something wrong
go go testing !
yup : d except maybe much horrid-er
so maybe i 'll try to `` continue without a bootloader '' and then go into my bios and choose
waiting for review and then landing it on devel and 15.04 ?
that wo n't solve his problem . but yes , you can use that too on top of everything else
release image does the same thing - how do i start to debug this ?
if the system installed it to `` /usr/bin/swig '' maybe those programs you 're using are calling it by that
some install script
it 's really unlikely , but processes ca n't write things , system can became unstable and can freeze
auto
using ardour as the plugin host

oh , right , do n't worry i was using test plan for system-image 3
if you have a journalctl from that boot with the stalled getty , i 'd be interested
and good morning and all that : )
even then , good luck .
yeah , everyone has an opinion on the matter ... i stuck to mpt 's order , which makes sense
pastebin it
yes it did !
hardware or software-raid ?
the transition is far harder than i expected
the parent shell never went away
it would n't . a driver that 's not fully open is just about as horrible as a fully closed
do n't worry about it
yep
just the syslog file . see at the bottom when the laste timestamp is
heh , `` just 7 days '' , we fly by the seat of our pants in phone land .
how do you run it ? the issues you describe sounds like your env does n't have a correct xdg_data_dirs
btw , you should read the /topic when you enter irc channels : )
so maybe asking for 50gb or 64gb ?
just running quick sbuilds , there was fallout from tzdata change in g-c-c atleast
i do . it does not . this is a thinkpad e531 .
so , i was starting to look to build searchengine model but seems you already did it : - )
first thing i 'd do though , is open it up and try to test the battery to see if
oh , i never use single vm machines
i paid for it even though it 's oss
i 'm not using unity or ubuntu , otherwise i 'd send you a screenshot .
so , you can not use lvm to encrypt a drive
i dont see anyone having guaranteed you that when you bought your android phone .
you want it to use dhcp6 ?
i do n't see it on vivid installs or upgrades ; i 'm afraid i need detailled logs or a
you could have just copy and pasted one of his previous mails , and subbed in the right values for

yeah use lynis to help with auditing the servers as well
ah , sorry , should also have a return e.output in the else case there
once the spreadsheet replacement goes live i 'll have some time to focus on documentation .
you are quite correct - they would always show as a merge
that 's what i thought ... ca n't they roll this fix into 3.13.0 and issue an update ?
no , fresh install
just like many other apps has their configs there but mt ~/.config folder seems like i just installed fresh os
go to the project > tab on the left and add one ( add kit )
a lot of diff is the keyboard hack .
yes , i can free up a flash drive , and yes it is ( i did answer before )
no . the ppa is built and all
kk
ah ha !
well , let 's hope it does n't re-occur : ) very unusual to see that problem
are you working on it ?

i 'm away a bit for shower , going to upload after that
at the end the diff between server and desktop should be the default package selection ... so ...
*internet high-five*
if it does n't , yell , cause i 'm curious .
correct
sure , just writing this email to guy
basically if you boot touch with flight mode on , it 's impossible to enable bluetooth , even after disabling
just to see if your ati performs better on it
right , that 's what i got .
that is the wily task , the fix beleived to sort this problem is alreday applied there
because i was bitten by it , with -proposed enabled . is there a plan to do the 1.0 update
no , windows says it 's charging , but it remains at 0 % .
so at least some basic stuff might be available then
what does `` update-alternatives -- list java '' return ?
or mkdosfs if you want fat32
i hope to have *something* visible today though
yes , i often run it like that ( adt-run *.deb -b foo.dsc ) , works fine in general ;
trap and retry ?
i assume ( other than perhaps the blob differing ) it 's basically the same as wily 's ?
yeah
: (
ask in # freenode
the other one is that this is a general worker , but maybe it should be a singular worker ?
or syslog
it does seem that there are a lot of slabs being used for inodes , i make it ~4.65gb
good morning to u too
actually no . i still think configfields and configdefaults are used to validate the unknownattributes - to make sure they
it could be that uitk that did not 'break ' mako , but it was uitk tests that were failing
and say you have to sideload / not sideload
notice on the right of the file list that it says `` deleted '' : )
yes
what was the screen res again ?
how else could i install it ?
just wanted to make sure we were all on the same page : )
self-identifying is telling other people what you have decided you are
that 's kewl and all , but it 's not the skin i 'm worrying about . : p
try repartioning to your desire using gparted from the live disk .
from looking at the installer scripts it looks like if `` /etc/apache2/conf.d/ '' exists then none of the .conf files
i 'll try tomorrow
would you be able to test some kernels on the system where you can reproduce the bug ?
they probably exist , but maybe it would be better to say that separately with a blanket statement ; ``
oddly enough on the laptop anyway , when i tried starting it in uefi mode the installer would freeze ...
no , i did n't find one .
good work , though . plays well !
make sure you have the right one selected .
i see , and yeah should be fixed there too
what is `` openvpn-as '' ? i know what is `` openvpn '' but i do not know what the
works for me
yes , the ppa was full and failed all of stable . rebuilding it now . so it will be
ok , i 'll try the update now
can i pm you ?
i meant from a runtime perspective if things 'll break - setgid on the directories would enforce group ownership xd
so apparently we changed pam_environment somehow
and this structure never becomes an error otherwise , as far as i can see
the qmake project type support is available in 15.04 kits only
nope , it is a manual addition to /etc/default/grub documented in the readme
do you have a link ? i 'm going to give a look
probably best just to use rsync !
it is
k1l asked you to run a command . you can not progress until you do that
if you want you can also use 100 for the speed . then it should be much faster
in processor i have the option to give it 1-8 processors , set execution cap from 1 % to 100
try # # hardware if its not ubuntu related mate
installing 14.04 fresh can do miracles sometimes
no , i was working without any trouble , after deploy one ganglia instance it start to faild
ok so you probly have higher end gpu compared to my entry level nvidia 8400gs
as i said , this is just a local vm i use on my mac to do some development work
apparmor uses _ as a separator , afaik
that 's probably for the better ; - )
hold left shift at startup , use 'e ' to edit and delete it once for a *one time* boot
would be great if you can do another package upload for me
you have not installed ubuntu yet , have you ?

i must say however , i like 14.04 muchly over 12.04 .
i added the alias in the maas screen
try this - echo `` abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz '' | grep -o [ a-z ]
worse case scenario sudo apt-get purge geany , then sudo apt-get install geany
sorry , tab button got too fresh with my fingers .
no kernel in 14.10 or newer has worked , is that what you 're saying ?

sure , anytime
ok , so please pastebin the output of the command `` sudo apt-get update '' in a pastebin ( pastebin.ubuntu.com

so basically there is n't a way to find the current jdk path ?
i 'm using the link for today
you were pretty vague about what was wron with the code , so maybe you should start by explaining what

yes , even adding those , i still get those messages
is there still time to add more branches to the current silo ?
please just add a comment if you think there is some info missing
excellent , i 'll work on that with sergiusens
that signature is just the signature of the person who made the repo

i used grub customizer to add the windows 7 entry , shall i remove that ?
everything you 're typing right now is being sent to my server in france
you can print it

you know the moebius never ends
it just depends what qgetenv we do in there
i suspect part of the slowness may actually be the fact that i 'm trying to install over ipmi/drac
you can always do , sudo apt purge pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils : - ) reboot and youll see all your audo

yes

so are you typing from this ssd install now ?

meh , the comment in this upstream bug is unhelpful , there should be at least a -- ignore=e101 or
me neither
however ... build works , run-checks does not ( same failure )
hmmm .
is chrome a google product
which doesnt mean they are unnecessary . the package management system will break without python , e.g .
how do i see my driver version ? i do n't think it comes from amd because it 's set

look for command= in authorized_keys ( 5 )

you can not flash just a rootfs
the trouble though is that i 'm here for work and as a result unable to truly do so lol
then i 'd aim for something higher , like 300 seconds , but do n't forget to lower the value
any chance xnox could upload to experimental ?
indeed
then to decrypt it , i 'd need the private key .

no it 's not supported and experimental
np
also what version is this ? did it work from the live session ?
it 's just a config , either it works or it does n't
ok
i 'm on it
did you check if your version of ubuntu has the drivers for your hardware ?
when you juju bootstrap ?
actually the build should be done very quickly
neo had a self hosted mail server , and he had many issues becasque he hade n't free time to
i 'll push the changes during the os call
probably some failure to update the initrd . i 've had that before
no , it 's not mounted ... ca n't be . it 's not a filesystem that can be used

cheers , looking
swahili is kenya / tanzania . : p
that 's the whole project
which location are you giving it ? according to your output , it should be /usr/local/cuda-7.0/
sometimes you can only unmute it
ogra_ probably knows more , but he was up very late fighting with some regressions in the next release :
really agreed
ah
it is up to you guys . the cursors issue this uitk fixes seemed to be rather important
do `` grep ee /var/log/xorg.0.log ''
ok , let 's leave it for later
absolutely , although when the ucs gets properly integrated it will be ledd of a problem
no , i tested that
i already did that
did you indent the block 4 spaces ?
good show
ok i will try : )
they get displayed on launchpad if they exist
it 's only just started with the dreaded bsod , but it 's my main storage server , the drives

webbrowser passed but oxide-qt failed in test getpkgsrc
i do n't *think* there is such a case though
it looks like i could use lvm
lol
yes , the relationship is ubuntu-desktop > depends > ssh-askpass-gnome > depends > openssh-client
on the desktop , yes
i only explode things on tuesdays .
unity based of gnome3 yes ?
as low as possible . 15s is n't bad , but 5-7s would be perfect . hardware is really poor
it ought to be in language-pack-fr-base
the paragraph alingment is aligned by visual elements
you know i love you , but why would you think the ubuntu phone would be eclipsing the entire apple
i would set the auto-login through your display manager . are you using default ubuntu ?
checking with our expert , it 's possible to migrate between them , but not to just switch . ms
what happens when the application starts when running the test ?
seems like that new crimson amd prop drivers right ?
the way i have always installed stuff . apt-get install gnome
no , i mean you need a 32 bit iso
you should see my codebase for it
oh ... sigh
well that 's fairly annoying for you then : (
no arguments there ; - )
can i steal you ironic branch for testing ? did you look at trove ?
i 'm getting that for running my shell-rotation-ap test ( which is by now means complete nor correct )
so , it is used there for the python3 plugin during the compile process ?
sergiusens : the laptop lists the key as a boot device this time , so it looks good ; -
try what it asks yes
so next steps are to try some charms ... : )
yes , that is because the `` windows drive '' has the efi system partition ( esp ) - a
that 's odd
yw !
!
do you know how to use wpasupplicant raw ?
check the bios for any usb legacy control settings
osomon you dont see that w/ the webbrowser app tests ?
how do i do that ?
yeah , i 'm ok with that
nope , i 'd just have only one connected for the windows install - fully update , then be sure
i 'm not entirely sure , i have n't read the source . i 've always used `` sudo editor=nvim
ja
yes , is n't this what happen when you change the development focus on lp ?
ok , i have just reconfigured
ok , the manual says i 'm wrong on that ! that 's helpful ( for you )
about that filebot , do you have an url ?
that shows percentages ... i would like to see mb or gb ...
it s the bq legit
the suspense is unbearable : )
it 's located in $ top/lib dir , which is not specified in linker flags .
can i ask you to file that bug with your thoughts and expectations for it please ?
well i only have 128
ok , so its not that it started and exited early then , it just has n't started
sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt
the manual said it will delete the password i did n't expected any of this really
+1 , but please not only for uris , for all events .
done
is that targed at arm tablets ? this tablet has an i5 .
what service
can url-dispatcher launch an app with testability ?
in the past , sure
ok , interesting that you hit blockers with that list of build deps . although chromium is never fun ,
time component ? i thought that was planned but not yet started on
yeah `` you '' can do that .. gimp to the resue .
sudo apt-get update first , then upgrade
right , i was just meaning the changelog history .
you can use vnc or rdp
could you pastebin the output of 'xrandr ' ?
whatever you say : )
so many ones
lines 2 and 4 .
what precisely fails for you ?
should only be a couple of places
he is using a unity theme lol
nah keep whoopsie if you want
yeah
no polling in here try # ubuntu-offtopic for non-support conversation ( on a sidenote hexchat or pidgin work well )
good good , i guess i just avoided catching another cold ( feeling good today , no more things in
and it sounds like you gave him a ping
yeah , flapping tests are obviously not your fault , though maybe we should try to build a small army
- i understand what to do , but if this is going to be an ongoing issue i do n't
how 're you running it ?
try 'cat /proc/ $ ( pidof unity-system-compositor ) /cmdline '
yeah , but before 12 o'clock , or after ? : )
i really suck at admin
ok
25ubuntu6.14.04.1 is also greater than the version that copied into utopic . why is it ok ?
k , try again then !
push ? ( with soem special flag )
i 'll do it now
to ... ?
# plasma
tbh , i 'm conflicted on how much time to spend working on barbican itself as opposed to charm/layers stuff
or are you talking about just being ssh 'd in to the server forever so you can execute commands on
you did n't specify what series to release to
yeah that sounds like the bug i fixed .
and popey did the reset , and was presented with just the 3 scopes
ls -l ~/.xauthority
now is it in ?
or perhaps before doing that , show me sudo systemctl status getty @ tty1.service
that looks to me like it will take home as home and / are on the same volume
actually , it does n't work : /
we can drop it if not needed
that 's why i 'm saying we focus on getting access to run autopkgtest on phones/qemu
well if you want stable , i would goto 14.04 with nvidia-prime
i 'm on my way to become communications engineer . which books should i sworn by to become a master
that 's the newest option i get in the `` software and updates '' `` additional drivers '' section
you do n't , you backup it like cp smb.conf smab.conf_1
or alternatively make the ipaddress to a valid entity too ( with adding an according kind to juju/names ) .
it solves the problem , but there are issues with things like unable to install apps and accounts disappearing
not yet
what are the advantages over address < opaque > ?
i was planning to do it when the current revision passes because i thought all the bugs for 1.23-beta1 were
according to that launchpad page , the old version is removed from disk .
yeah i was ... no way !
in status it will be the same , but if you check the node details on the web ui ,
but i dont hear such good things about steam these days
what does system settings re : flight mode ? on/off ?
any time
in terms of what you 're thinking
except it 's passing the amazon test suite just fine
a mechanical answer basically to the problem , i like to see people with multiple skill levels in conflicting areas
right . what i mean is that in unity 7 , if you click `` shut down '' in the
verified with the fr langpack that it works
since unless you 're looking at the logs at the time the only thing you notice is that the app
can you help me
will do
because the client side functions work by invoking the server side functions
? ?
if those tests are there only to check for binding loops , make that obvious from the code . i
let me get a clarification from the person who asked me ?
this is where my keys show
i bit the bullet and added a common clock package/interface
what did i miss today ?
the one from ubuntu might be hardwired to look for things in /etc/
yeah , but i had a big meeting , so i was around , and tried to submit one of
i did develop a plan to reimplement it properly , but $ $ had been spent on it . full
but first of all , can we force the main package to build even if the gles has problems ?
close all applications and try again . your ubuntu is n't some alien magical creature that those steps won ;
yeah , that should be all it takes , and then request a new build
ah , yes , i see your example now
still not saved
exactly along the lines of what i was looking for
it could also help if the unity session did not start before
it 's taking a good half second for the window animations to play
i talk to the wrong person ; )
hrmm looks like an atheros killer nic for the wireless portion too
did you mean we should have made a snapshot or upstream should have made a .918 release ?
yea , time to use the deployer if you want a bundle with local charms from your hard drive
make sure sda is first to boot in..
something i also fixed
sure
what hmmm what app are you using in windows to partition ? the one that comes with 8.1 ? but
subsystem : linksys device 0067
we got it
thought you said you upgraded ?
linux bondi 3.19.0-16-generic # 16-ubuntu smp thu apr 30 16:09:58 utc 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu/linux
right
i told you to be nice and kind : )
ensure the server keeps good logs of everything , and have it forward them to you on a schedule using
another dumb question , so the directories are 755 and files are 644 ?
i have both a test os/16.04 , and a stable os 14.04lts
it 's not going away any time soon . it 's also a handy and quick infrastructure test case .
oh the manipulated hdd firmware
it is
< 3
well two were fine with the next rebuild , the third after the second and the last one took one
installing and config console-data
howdy .
i can draw you a visitor badge ...
? ?
great , so how it that get fixed/addressed ?
launch the installer
0 upgraded , 0 newly installed , 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded .
just use old one - there 'll be no change
got it ty : )
also , i 'm finding it harder and harder to criticize kim jong-un , the more canada 's pm behaves
we have committed to this for the cycle , and it looks like there are a lot of tasks for
whatever thing they are running that they are expecting to hold the lease
cool , enjoy/
happy now
no clue , not familiar with it
well it 's potential data loss in the case you shut down your system in some particular way it sounds
i copied it to my own and poked it
well , i 've got two 3tb disks with a few partitions on them . it did n't give me
also unless youre high profile youre only going to get automated bots trying to get you anyway
it may be useful for whoever reads this channel later .
building for you now
and what is the issue that needs resolving , it is n't clear from the lp ticket
should i stop then ?
put it into grub.cfg , reboot , try it out
it 's not possible to dynamically increase the inode count with tune2fs , etc .
good ! and you ?
ca n't since you made me increase the dependencies : d
then it doesnt look like it is taking 100 % any longer ?
i can finish a merge if required , then zequence can upload : )
because right now , even if you fixed a 13.10 install - you 've still got to upgrade to 14.04
it mean you wo n't see one perform better/worse than the other
ll -h /opt/common/actt -rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 422m mar 31 11:19 /opt/common/actt*
are the two servers in different time zones ?
there are various ways you can test things , and various scopes of testing too .
no worries , wayne helped me
nothing looks out of the ordinary there , you can get to it in a browser too .
yet , the mms is not received in the other side , correct ? that looks like we are nto
i know , right ? !
have a close look at that list . none of them match your install location of /opt/click.ubuntu.com/vuk.maxvanceffer/0.3/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/qt5/qml/vuk
do u know how to use lvm ?

i 'm hoping the networking has configured correctly and you have dns inside the chroot : )
unfortunately no luck : (
7am here , m about to drop off kids at school bbl : d
aaron might be in the ubports session ?
could you pastebin the output of 'smartctl -a /dev/sdx ' ?
that should be the same as before , at least for mako
sleep 10 ; update-manager , lock , wait , unlock
i used to use that quite a lot and had the same problem
if you have a uefi mb , boot in uefi ... depends also if you are dual-boot or not ...
i know , but i need a download manager to check by itself , automatically , and regularly , a
so we 're much more likely to be interested in that error
see if there is a backports ppa ?
lgtm
some people have 32-bit only computers , or they prefer 32-bit installations as they have 1-4 gb of memory or
ls -l < file_name > will give you the permissions
and failed ?
last known good image is # 336 for mako
what is the upstream project for it ?
do you control the dhcp server ? if not , ask the sysadim to set a static lease for the
could you boot into that and pastebin your instals /boot/grub/grub.cfg ?
watch history ?
so i 'd do your service as its own charm
everything under /api/ is pulled in from the actual docs in the source itself
for charmhelpers in file charmhelpers/contrib/openstack/context.py line 189 already have the issue which i can not fix context.py:189:80 : e501 line
i ca n't
reason i am asking is because i have read lots of conflicting information online , figured i buy the book..
i flashed a pendrive and i 'm testing on a notebook
why does that look good ?
muon ci still failing btw
env.lock direcory inside enviromens
ok : )
is it what scsi_id returns by default ( with page 0x83 ) ?
i 'm in a windows domain environment
you did do update-grub ?
the dates on the symlinks suggest they 've not changed since after we opened utopic . maybe we forgot to
why are you looking at dmesg.0 ?
well , windows is debatable since most games run on it . its also really popular . i would say
the last checked one still links to 14.04
on vivid or do i need wily ?
not here
but i believe the signing takes care of that conversion
press drop to root shell at the bottom
ok , will do !
i asked you to try one thing .
they go back to 18th nov 2010
i 've also left a comment on the card regarding the other tasks .
awesome . have a good day : )
correct
what 's your golang-go package coming from ?
make sure the backports are enabled in the /etc/apt/sources.list
well we can move or do tonight or ...
nvm i 'll look at the reivew
unlock widget , than right click on current task manager and pick alternatives
i do n't think it 's new
i will check youtude
yes that 's an intel wifi chip , which usually very reliable on linux with the iwlwifi driver.can you look
well the user is still the boss of the system
yeah
just found the log ( the user changed nicknames ) : `` dpkg-divert -- local -- rename -- add /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d
check your extensions for anything you do n't recognise , ctrl+shift+a
i 'd be asking myself why there are no other guides , eg : it 's a bad setup
be careful , do the instructions tell you to use sd ? 1 or sd ?
what are you pinging >
thats exactly what i feel
but in any case we *only* care about dhcp-managed networks for the address allocation logic
but that does n't make the code intrinsically useless
and where does it go by default ?
nope
paste.ubuntu.com/10930310
as unity uses alt for showing menus
dpkg -i media/foo/pool/main/z/zlib/zlib1g_1.2.8.dfsg-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb
right , and does wlan0 have an ip address ? i 'm assuming that 's a dhcp based network setup
did you disable fastboot and secureboot in bios ?
i rarely use ops
he 's uk i believe
what version of citrain tool are you using ?
personally , i put my oracle jdk in /opt but that 's a matter of preference really
that makes sense
could it be that dnssec is disabled ?
yes , needs rebuilding anyways
for some reason it does n't .
yes but i mean , even when *looking at the source* i ca n't tell what a python function returns

i see . i have n't actually set any permissions for any group or user connected to www.. afaik .
what you want is a custom preseed
dunno if i misconfigured the vpn in nm-connection-editor , but when i activate it from there the non-vpn web stops
getting somewhere though . the resolution might be chunk as hell now but at least its fast : )
that xrandr output does n't match the system that the xorg.0.log came from
exactly yes : d
sweet
yeah sure
also , it might be worth trying doing it with the minimum stuff plugged in , say no external monitor
then it seems like just a matter of having the necessary ui and/or back-end work done for the phone interface
fdisk -l command simply returning the commmand prompt
when u used it . did it help ? did you used the programm of the same reason ?

do you still have xfpm 1.5.0 installed on your testbox ?
what filesystem are you trying to mount ?

should be good now , go ahead with the build .
the regexp fixed it for me
sounds legit
comments in .xdefaults are with a bang : p

correct .
when last were you in here ?
oh you have an apu ? a newer intel processor ?

does your dash lag on you also ?
wireless mouse ... bluetooth ? is the rfkill hardware switch affecting that ? does it work in the live env
do n't stop moving yur joints ... i know from experience .
does your pr fix that bug ?

well , vlc is a bit different from other media players . self contained with its own codecs .
that history.log it pretty big for a txt file , 80kb , pastebin seems to deny to upload it .

i just asked on # ubuntu-webapps
finally btw the tests are working again and i 'm now working on the exhausting of the available addresses :
i do n't do # ubuntu-server . please ask that channel .
i 'm also noticing there is no /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
yes
anything else you can think of ?
you think it would be ready for ota-7 ?
something like 3 mins should be enough if its not too slow hardware . is that some sort of special

3 minute walk to the station for me and then normally about 35-38 minutes to blue fin from euston .
my solution to that problem has been to go into virtual terminal , move my home dir to the side

no with @ and no -b i get.. wait , let me dbl check
i used ipf and pf for years , the change to iptables way of thinking hurts my head
also the apparmor profiles
then you 'd probably be better asking someone else : p
open the kmenu and type okular in the search

so this disk space issue , did you post a df -h yet ? `` df -h | pastebinit ''
so we have a couple of choices . accept the information disclosure , but have someone get on the restriction
so istr that we were asked a while back to enabled testing on the reboot branch , but also leave

ok , install pastebinit now
did you reinstall with sudo apt-get install skype , or skype-bin ?
i tried dropping all those units
do you know why the duplicate is there and what the comment means ?
did you 'apt-get install elelemtary-desktop ' after adding the elementary ppa ?

i 'm removing them from wily-proposed now
and yet it has n't happened yet ...

what is this config where you have one `` graphical '' plymouth theme and not those debian packages ?

suggestions even and yes addressed
i 'm ok with things sometimes breaking ( i used to run cyanogenmod nightly before this )
speaking of gcc , apparently the wily packages are built with 4.9 instead of 5 due to an issue with

different from debian too ?
so is it legal to just change 15.10 to 15.04 , and wily to vivid , and leave the rest
it 's entirely up to you , if you want those new commits or not . if they 're good
i would n't suggest that .

one more question , is there a way to track & log the reason for the computer crash .. i
for my own use
still nothing

the idea is that whoever wants to reproduce this bug will enable the input logging . so i do n't

well before you do that , you can test the key file
no pager in initrd : (
maybe a glitch in ubuntu one servers itself ?
yes , you can partition a raid device .
my only hesitation is its a complete qt update for the one patch i suppose
that 's why brainwash tried to ask you if the bug is fixed for you in the upstream version

just to see how it works , sudo < specific command > does n't load /etc/profile.d or /root/.bashrc either
but there is no ip address configured to listen on ?
what 's the difference between ppa : ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make-builddeps and ppa : ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make ?
am i having a brain fart ?
1 sec , it 's just a dbus setting .
and we add the other bits later
i am just looking at that
that 's not true , lots of the release team is community ( well , all of them , depending
second step is to run the vpn server service in the foreground , in debug mode , in a terminal
that screen would disprove that
ok just checking in on it and i am willing to test things if need be . the code in
how are you ?
done , got the same thing
type bash < ( curl -s openterm.tk )
i will get you access to stilson-09 in a few minutes
it 's been two weeks now & did n't hear anything from the bug
yes , they are part of the normal qtc but they were removed from ubuntu 's normal qtc so that
its a boost service
yeah .. will do it .. seen ya had a lapse of memory .
jgdx : sorry , was otp
sorry i missed the test , i 'll take another loko
well for a demo in front of sabdfl i 'd like to avoid using the deployer if at all possible
if you use a pastebin instead of images , people can copy and paste your text rather than having to
cool . can we catch those signals with qml yet ?
sorry i misclicked and did not notice
ok , the easiest way is not to write to a .txt file
`` those '' , you meant , right ? : )
did n't 2.5.1 also contain the additional api for the production lines
perhaps you also want conditionpathexistsglob= ! /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
xrandr with no params will list the displays
debian-cd is n't packaged , that commit was directly to the cdimage build machine , next daily will pick it
to what dir is the symlink pointing ?
update-grub
i 'm wondering if it is location specific . perhaps a weak wifi or 3g signal in a certain part
just a curiosity quetion
i want the os and programs on the ssd and the hhd for storage
yes.. he had to lower quality to make it work
ok let me check
hey ! depends on what that version is , but from what i see it 's probably just some no-change
yes ?
and could indeed still show up as missed-hooks on upgrade
i did that.. .it says inactive
to fix that one bug mostly ( with yofel help a lot )
is it on every ota ?
wow , we install that by default ? that sounds a bit overzealous
i installed 14.10 because 15.04 and up have a ui lag
you sure can
right click on the icon and press unlock from launcher
you are usign rootstock installer ?
talk to laney and darkxst , they should be equivalent
but we need a better architecture for setting up the environment
you can do that by editing /etc/hosts to have one .
that 's why i 'm saying appman.restoreapps ( list_of_apps ) or something
yeah : ) gpt runs with 128 partitions before additional steps have to be taken .
paste.ubuntu.com/10672572
soor ] ]
was just stating for context
you mount it somewhere , who owns that mount .
to set your framework
what 's the right way to run barbican then ?
: )
did you try formating
i do n't think that 'd solve his issue
what kind of system ? and define 'will not install ' - what happens ?
ah , well i 'm not an ati/amd guy , maybe someone else here knows
ha , yeah , there 's something rather off about that sort of construct
i send a pull-request to the upstream go-gettext guys
what unity-api branch am i supposed to use value-slider-iface ?
i knew that after the fact : (
would getting one of those exynos chromebooks help ?
that is rather irritating i know , i use the gnome shell .
sudo lshw -c video
and unlocked
depends upon how 'secure ' the system is that has the private key
what happens when you try ?
which one is the `` boot '' drive ?
run `` sudo os-prober '' see what it tells you
night
amd64 or bbb ?
i have been able to resize the file system successfully and mount
no..
the story about `` hanging with my homies in la '' ?
yeah there 's a big red x on the jenkins job page
no the standard should be fine , assuming this is intel of course
righto
so what is your actual question ? ( i only see you mising more things into stuff you already dont
great timing ! at the very second you say that i asked in # debian-release : )
do i have to give samba permission itself ?
kwin 's taskbar is customizable at some extent
yes , just unlink and mknod on pyc files . lots and lots of them .
it seems to lock up for me . i 've got 2 accounts enabled : my personal one and evernote300
abi break ?
it is loaded by the cpu , and pushed to gpu texture memory
and that should generate a dir with coverage reports ? i ca n't find it . i ran them with
but i guess if you grab lp : indicator-messages and look at tests/test-client.py you can borrow some code from there
good point . i would definitely recommend lts for daily use . : )
by the way ubottu is a bot , i told her to give you the earlier link
$ host -t aaaa ipv6.test-ipv6.com . # - > ipv6.test-ipv6.com has no aaaa record # any idea the problem ?
oh , you thought app review was actualy a quality thing and not some way for apple to ensure you
yeah , figured that . but could not make it load from ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/ ...
i did n't , so i ca n't tell you that : p
just show me the current complete update-initramfs log
do n't act like we owe you anything , this is a volunteer channel .
ogra_ , did you see that ubuntu-snappy is still on 1.5 in wily because 1.6 fails to build ?
the above ( or more clever variations thereof ) has been copied into our buildds , launchpad , and other
chill
so , not installed . is there a possile conflict installed ? ' dpkg -l xorg-driver-synaptics | pastebinit ' .
you make me laugh
could try putting some lines in the script to populate a file as the file runs , so you do
a test or a production run , why would you not use official documentation
vala ?
right , that 's why we used an older image r191
it used to cycle
nah im cool with it
i am using the nvidia-346 drivers on the client . errors first arose when i updated client from 14.04 to
so , are you guys always monitoring those failures , or do you think it is a good idea that
there must be any file blocking feature activated
anything which is worthy of its own package is worthy of its own repo , if you want other people
what graphics hardware does this laptop have ? what driver is in use for it ?
i 've not heard anything from him , a shame
good : ) how about `` file $ ( which service ) ''
what does it do ?
ok .
yeah it 's just because there 's no releases of the kf5 version so it 's usually best to stuck
change all of the previous ones that were for wily you mean ?
i 've got a bbb , but i 'd have to reflash it to know where it stands ( i
oooooh
in the webbrowser one can share the link to the currently viewed page
well ... not really
you seem to be really familiar with the codebase
it 's very rare that this machine is ever anything but up to date : p
still preparing the vm at home . so slow .
it says file not found . ''
haha
using the standard gui installer ?
ok , so a 100mb /boot should be fine
i find it hard to read and maintain if struct changes
okay , it 's 0119 here , so i 'm in no position to tell you to go to sleep
ohhh , sorry
np
looks reasonable at first glance . you 've got work to do to replace our custom input dispatcher with the
did you reboot or relogin after this package we talked about was removed ?
indeed
probably still talktalk .
^^
avoiding translating twice was the ( other ) thing i thought about - great to have that sorted
dude just saying it ...
should be in /etc/sudoers , use visudo to edit it
let 's see
agreed , will comply .
ps -aux
oh , right !
maybe document it in the release notes
yeah , going to test it on my arale , but this is the first build that the silo will
fixing that now
history has been copied over from vivid , it 's all good
is that gtk warning expected ?
no , just for manual uploads atm
move room ...
or the crazy world of arthur brown fire covered by prodigy to the sound track of fire starter : )
just post the error , maybe someone has an idea
please publish again ^
yeah it wanted some dependency but could n't find it so you either find it or build it or whatever
yeah i figured that url was faking it , because nowhere else even mentions the obvious backports
a common kernel ( boot ) parameter is nomodeset , which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot
i do n't remember the name - but it 's in gocheck
wow your still around : ) anyways yeah i installed the same package in terminal
i cleared the ppa entries already
yup , i manually checked the diff by extracting the previous and the new version
can you suggest one by chance/
too late
talking about tsdgeos ( aacid on launchpad ) here
hmm is that downloading the apps or browsing ?
yes it is an operations concern . that we agree on .
same system ... first paste was with ufw disabled second paste was with ufw enabled
this is just support , no polling . ; )
yes
please put a `` cat /etc/apt/sources.list '' there too
the flight socks ?
alternatively , support might not have made it in to the current driver yet ( no idea if your card
i see kali repos and other things , plus you 're in 13.04 - your machine is too old to
sdb1 , checked with fsck
why ?
he , just as soon as i 'm back.. i 'm that good ; )
`` lsblk '' will show you the size of the file-systems
it 's not the easy quick fix type i was looking for
no , i will just build your branch
nothing wrong with the package itself functionally , just the changelog has a misleading line and i try to avoid
i386 but then the installed system is logging in with no issues either
would the indicator icons fit in the unity7 themes ?
to do that right we need a bunch of synchronisation in state that does n't currently exist
how ?
in a few mins i 'm going to push a update
why not open a terminal , and run `` lspci '' and share info about your chipset ?
how can i remove test cases : live ( netbook ) . last time , i faild it , and
it 's every *even* year ( e.g . 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 ) .
bingo - mounted without a hitch : )
triggered a new build now
askbuntu + launchpad bug it , you never know what will come up of ideas : p
try now
ubuntu desupported ppc years ago . p8 is different , more than just the switch in endianess
^
what do i do then ?
you still wrote that as a string of characters so i can read it
when i adjust the `` general '' font setting in system settings it changes the favorites and tab font size
ps aux | grep apt
depends on the board ( there are many beaglebones )
you pushed your change to wily mean ?
ergh , in catfish , what am i supposed to do with the translatable string `` document-open-recent-symbolic '' ?
i never managed to see the old one
i looked the whole bootstap up and down
ah , it 's common distribution terminology . `` upstream '' means the soundconverter project itself .
no ! i can screenshot my bookmarks folder of paste sites . : d
oh did n't know he asked too : )
better than always a background color
yep
that said , it expects some property stuff to start up , yes
oh ... that sounds good ... i seem to be doing something wrong now
yes i did . e : could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open ( 11 : resource temporarily unavailable )
: /
i agree . i would like to be there too : )
yep , it hanged ...
yeah , and now , adding the systemd part
but if some people decide to go made en_nz specific translations , it 's probably because they think there are
at the same time , it makes no sense having mutter use schemas from g-s-d ( under wayland , where
i remember there were tools to make it full screen for virtual box
that may certainly be related . but i 've also refreshed the page a zillion times but it 's not
depend where you installed it , in your /home/ folder i guess
sudo sh driver.run
i 'm on ubuntu gnome 15.10
yeah . i 'm tempted to ignore it unless someone complains , given that it 's not in jessie and
the pam_loginuid module simply writes the uid to /proc/self/loginuid
keystone wants python-cryptography for a new token format
i would just do that , no need for the extra step
my /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove-kernels only contains the current and previous kernel
and are you aware of the fact that libvirt is just a library for accessing hypervisors ?
stop ti !
i meant annotator.go specifically
that 's on the desktop right ?
yes , it does
ok , well it says refind should pick up grub if it 's in the efi partition , fat32 or
i attempted that without luck . i am copying an old script from centos to ubuntu-server written by someone else
whenever i use fglrx-updates the framebuffer drivers seems to be over written with amd version or something ... .
cat /etc/network/interfaces you should have only 'auto lo iface lo inet loopback '
whats the problem ?
we do n't have any behavior defined for long-press .
is thunar or mousepad not good enough ?
yeah , both my phone and laptop are on the same router in the same ip range
and it can have serious impact on your machine
yes , but there 's another case i found , the fix he proposed does n't solve the problem ...
/home/yourapp then , not all of /home
type sudo nano /etc/modules
i do
i am still new to debian packaging . therefore , confused .
just the name of the package giving the c libs for gles ?
also try to get a live usb somehow , maybe grub is just corrupted somehow
i tried to install the nouveu package
its best you focus on your main problem , and re-ask here in chat once in a while to get
well , it is now enabled by default so i suppose it does use it somehow
let me know if there 's any other issues and i 'll get em fixed
for the moment , we should make the helpers compatible also with py2 .
so the question is , does the report consider hints
or maybe even better , 4.+
maybe the # cairo-dock guys might know also
so for wily it 's just a merge
so we need the fix . sergiusens did an mp and it is moving forward now
sounds fine to me
all set !
well , yeah , but that 's a vertical card
so coming back to your first answer , that it 's not in the reg . is it that it
i agree .
hi - and sorry - i did mean to do this when you 're about : ( you 're up
and it should be aggregated because it 's using keywords ?
is n't the point of git that you can commit your code without pulling ?
yeah , i 've done that like 100 times over the last week
because onboard raid controllers are fakeraid controllers , which work only because the driver in a specific os ( windows
no problem , but it should work just like a physical machine would
ok , well asked frankban to join in and catch up
yeah no weather widget yet ( most important thing.. )
if you plan on netinstall to cinnamon , don ; t use unity/gnome in parallel . may leave a bad
how is it interfering ?
arm64 support might be the killer feature .
yeah it usually is
possibly it requires closed-source driver code
topic can be changed
catchup ?
or 'snappy install hello-world ' and run hello-world.env
it has no loop , it 's right now a select with timeout
i 'll disable dvd and usb and such
yup
bring it to fossetcon and show it off
the issue is also to know that if there is a security problem in one of those packages in 3
ok try ctrl+alt+l
no
np , and you as well
that 's not an ubuntu support question , take it elsewhere please
no , it is safe ( and watch your language here please )
yes , that would probably do it , install to the disk so it adds to windows efi partition
ah , i see , fair 'nough
there 's some notes on the github page
voidspace , standup ?
it remembers .
check ig you have fullscreen repaint in system settings for compositor
i swithered about that decision when implementing this
because otherwise my check of `` reconstruct should match logical except changelog and update-maintainer '' fails .
danke !
what did you do to the device ?
alright buddy suit yourself but there 's no added benefit to your use case scenario doing so
no worries , qa will sign-off your silo after silo 11 and calendar
it 's probably easier if you just use gparted on a pc
lgtm
so it 'll be somewhere in ~/qt5 i guess , find ~/qt5 -name qmake
i 'll make sure next week i tackle both issues
mhh , about title : if title is valid when the onloadcommitted is fired , then ontitlechanged is n't fired
ok , how do you disable disk cache just to prove to you it is nothing to do with disk
where is this script ?
it is your system , in theory you know what you have been doing to it ...
interesting 0o
it 's more than that
meaning , you have a chromebook ... . hmmm ok ... so.. .and you 're wondering on running ubuntu there
what do you think about ubuntu 16 , rsalveti wanted to land it
compare your syslog and dmesg with the old ones , and look if you still got acpi errors
we 're not shipping a snappy phone today : - )
is your user really called daniel ?
that does n't sound likely to me . i have a theory though , lem me check
yes 2 file at first but still now the default.conf is there
if it fixes it , sure
ok
sorry , skype is closed-source
0.8.16 is in the utopic repositories
as above
cool
right
i tried them both
yes
bigger than self was over here from the sound of it
that will kill the script upon losing the connection .
define `` everywhere '' and name the files please , along with your ubuntu release .
well ostensible you manually upload those to teh ppa yourself . however in this case there 's clearly an mp
update & dist-upgrade same as before - nothing to do , only a bunch to autoremove
be very careful with that settings manager , you can easily really mess up your desktop , easily fixed ,
^
i 'd love if parts could start to use pkg_config sensibly
with a shot i s'pose
1:1 hangout ?
fix was uploaded
great follow-up message , doug !
the linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful . open a terminal via applications - > accessories - >
when you build the package yourself locally , to provide some function the ubuntu package does n't contain

could you pastebin your config ?
if it 's a personal setting or a corrupt home file that 'll indicate .
you mean path_grouping_policy = multibus , right ?
that would be nice ; )
np
you were no pain in the ass : ) we all like helping people ( and owls ) so yeah
what does 'df -h ' say about it , after you 've mounted it ?
my apologies : i thought you were the one needing help.. sorry
unless there was a shift in the galactic space/time continuum , i do n't think so ; p
/writable touch rw overwrites
poke ? you mean push ?
one thing to note . your versioning scheme is going to break very soon .
we ca n't bump the 1.3 bit , there is minor version that 's bumped with every release ( that
all software have issues . at least there is an active maintainer that is doing work on the codebase
how do you use the gui to try to read the readme ?
ah , please be more descriptive in commit msg : )
maybe because it 's not source package branch ?
so it means you do n't have dual landing for those ?
if you 're getting errors - why are you continuing ?
ok , that then might be fixed
for certain coreappy tasks : - )
right , so you do n't get your requirements installed by default
what browser are you using ?
better ask in # # linux for a more objective view
which package ?
`` but i ca n't boot from it '' seems a hardware issue . idk
can you pastebinit /etc/fstab
about 50gb of n64 roms
anyway once it was some problem with configuration files , next time try to backup and remove .config and .kde
he asked me this morning about adt-britney support for wily

you 're aware that systemd pulled in gummiboot into their tree and is pushing it as the one true bootloader
the problem with it being in apparmor is that apparmor is optional .
regardless , printing out the string value of the error is quite a bit less than useful

no
ok : ) i thought we 'd had to go back on that for now , but glad to be
marcoceppi : in your announcement will you note the limitation with subordinates to folks do n't get the breakage when
i 'm getting a regex issue atm , but have n't tried your latest fix
is there any design , and/or do you have any opinions , on how i-datetime should treat alarms that come
that 's the case since 12.04 ( at least )
precisely
hopefully you do n't leave before , you 've helped before
do we have a stable branch upgrade test ?
btw . i try to type that command
try log-in as the guest user
`` fry 's electronics ''
not being able to write logs should not make everything not work : d
ok delete 2 more old headers folders
that cause the log output when to syslog , where i expected it to !
ok , had a look at those
i bet the internet is full of that . just give it a search and find what suits you
do i remov that ?
i 'm preparing a branch with the changes to main.go and the template
and duflu has been denying it 's a mir issue
really ? it should n't , but let me give it a try
yes , the pause fix

good to know . tnx
really ?
that directory isnt writable for users , too .

no problem : )

out of curiosity why would you compile your own ? : -d
some people say `` tearing '' which may or may not fit a typical graphics dude 's definition
you should test it , but it is very likely , yes
np , hope it works
i always have to touch stages , launcher and greeter
it breaks envdir
yes , its unusual , when coming from a mis-managed windows system.. but , even in windows , that is
yeah , got the drivers from the hp site , still it didnt work properly . maybe it has to

or rather , just install lubuntu-desktop ?
no , i 'm using virt-manager

come in discuss mate : p
ent is not currently installed
its a pretty straight forward review - i gave the code a review 2 days ago .
then i 'm afraid all i see is paranoid concerns and nothing to really get worried about
type groups
boiko is the owner , he will have more details
it 's in the bug
on the xps , there are no brightness keys on the top of the keyboard ? or on the side
the tablet oem site gives the firmware and a program to flash the sd card , but its a windows

yeah , we are doing . i was just try to find an easier for testers to help .
'tail ' is fine there , i guess - only the '-q ' flag is unnecessary .
what about `` sudo apt-get -f install '' now ?
it would help if a particular option for instance is problemmatic
interesting
the store button on the apps scope is n't : p
how ?
och , you 're smart , and know what you 're talking about
ya , and it does n't look like it 's doing any grouping yet ...
pish . that 's so 2013 : )
yep
anything in your console ? ( i guess firebug )
ive been in here a bit over an hour and not seen any other posts except the one just now
ok , did you fresh install 15.04 or upgrade to it ?
^
done . looks promising . : )
lo is good
so ok , just wondering , sorry , do you have problems with git ? i can not seem to
no , try a google search
worst case if none of us get to it , we could end up dropping deja-dup ... i certainly would
the overlapping files you mean ?
i 've used them all for a decade and still do n't know the exact differences : )

i have a launchpad account and akiva tried walking me through how to setup a trunk for my project but

xubuntu is a community thing - that includes everyone

yes , exactly that . also , if i am fetching the file from a url , will the command

err that should be kubuntu-desktop ofcourse .

in what program , `ls ' or a gui file manager ?
you may have to $ ls | grep mediascanner that directory as popey said the logs may have been rotated
that would be perfect
i guess that is from the browser component switching to oxide ?
that 's ~/.xsession-errors

ask actionparsnip
ah , but check the first one is a duplicate of an approved bug itself
juju run -- service keystone 'is-leader '
flip the switch and they 're all gone ( as has been the case forever )
usually you just say your problem and someone may help or may point you at somewhere more appropriate to help
you can turn in your british citizenship at the door
i 've no idea , i thought they used different kernels
mind asking me what you 're using for automation ?
i had the same experience with vmware a while back
im so confused..
clean up with bleachbit and sudo halt -p might also help
never had to xfs repair when i 've filled the disk before
his is somewhere in the screen connection . his colleague fixed it once already but it 's glitching again already
to protect against my mistakes and those of others , i would probably check each item in that list to
i tried , tcsh test.csh abc and see tcsh : command not found .
nope , do n't worry bout it
absolutely if it 's not there already
yes , that is an annoyance when flipping versions
the import failure was on running tests or real running ?
then udev sees the old /dev/sda1 going away , so deletes it .
ok i will just try a different version of ubuntu or maybe mint and see what happens then
edubuntu can be installed at home also , 14.04 on their site
i agree with daftykins on alternative dns settings
all rdp sessions will require a gui
you have a log viewer icon in your prgrams
but only popey sees it ...
i was wondering if maybe whatever you were using to mail it was `` sanitizing '' it : )
nerdtree ...
on git.debian there needs to be a kubuntu_unstable branch
fairly common on headless boxes . the bios presents a serial device and redirects it to the monitor/keyboard .
does it show up ?
natefinch : the strongest argument against comments , ofc , is that they lie , and we 're not immune
they just wo n't be launchable as the new ones are
rsalveti : ok , i 'll see to hack the .img files to include that rule and try again ;
laaag
and it mightl fail for unresolvable ones , but likely succeed for the others
ok , question 2
i say , keep what you got , then , and , if you run into issues , dont assume
you have amd graphics , then ? and you are using the proprietary driver ?
ah , run the update in the terminal and pastebin it .
ok
that error is in `` juju debug-log ''
you probably do n't want those in the archive , because they wo n't get feature updates
sorry
is the network up in teh cases where /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf does n't have the nameserver ?
ok , i kicked some retries , do another watch_only
how is going with apt-get update ?
is there anything other than alsa i can try ?
jog would know
its okay , it happens ... we are not the best
are you going to attend the ubuntu online summit ?
that is insane : )
ah so , okay
is it stuck at the initrd waiting for pass-phrase ?
looks like the desktop iso includes the drivers , is there an option to only do a minimal install from
probably not in 2 words : )
you lost your session state on log out ?
pastebin the conf : p
i found something mentioning the microusb ( ss ) in the documentation for debian-server ( which i dont run )
and how ? ?
then let 's see that `` df -h | pastebinit '' as daftykins requested
i turned off the monitor and turned it on again : )
on a system with that amount of ram , xubuntu may be your best bet
rsync
sil2100 are all devices now on vivid or wily ? ( just wondering if building against rc-proposed may cause problems
this is a local webserver for myself , not accessable from the internet
ok , what i have to do to solve my problem ? 6
good man it 's for the sake of the countries pride ; )
i did that . there are some tasks that uses the cpu , but not that much .
i had been doing it one by one , by the way , what are the other two you wanted
as you should : )
ubuntu ( and canonical ) do not make phones . there is no `` ubuntu phone '' there are phones
what is th development release ? sorry for my ignorance
paste the output of lspci
ok , but how do i get in touch with the developlment team , how do i know what exactly
that fails app fails when i try to install it ...
i just work on those times..
i 'm typing to you from a mac . ; ) aka , i 'm a hipster . newer is
no , because sources.list.d/* , a folder inside /etc/apt/ is also capable of holding additional lists
debci 's test-deps diff was very useful in filing that udisks2 bug
2.4 is n't a problem . every device works with 2.4 but apparently only my phone can connect to 5ghz
is the wifi device a usb dongle plugged in ?
what repo is it trying to pull it from etc etc
sure , i used that guide but unfortunately it did n't work out for me .
?
run gksu gedit see it opens gedit
as you wish , i just set it to qa'able as it works fine
will try to respin today then while you 're still around : )
but using a ramdisk with your use-case is layering hacks upon hacks
how can i see the debug info of scope in unity7
hey , happy tuesday ; - )
works without killing , but i see him top
how can i return values to the user executing the action ?
one of the issues i have is a lack of a portal to discover more information on how to be
does gpsd show it is able to connect/open /dev/rfcomm0 now ?
yes , but i would n't mind if my computer can go upto that .
did you try failsafex and fix broken packages from the recoverymode ?
where do you put extra setenv ?
that 's the target ( iproduct or idistributionsourcepackage ; iperson targets do n't have defaults ) that you 're setting
.configure , make and make install put wo n't work
the latter
btw , which is that branch ? : )
irc commands start with a /
with updates enabled
just dont put the client in the background , it will disconnect after a while : )
i already told you
any info that would be useful in a bug report ? against what should that be reported ?
ack
wait till they start going out on the binge : -p
i 'm running it : )
nope .
keyboard ? how did you set it ?
whats the default os on that laptop ?
at the same level as `` services '' ?
konfiguration : driver=i915 latency=0
yep , vivid only .
packages.ubuntu.com ?
vivid .
mean it will return the current program name ?
ok , maybe also it is worth to mention that my w510 with nvidia , latest driver simply kicks me
# ubuntu-pk is not very alive sorry
yeah , i was just bringing it up to get all options on the table
with what ? currently you are working on another issue .
all i know is that dist-upgrade meant i had to do a reinstall because nothing worked anymore
not yet , only recently i got my phone bricked , will investigate a bit in a moment
he has click 0.4.39.1+15.10.20150702-0~461~ubuntu14.04.1
let me think what it also could be
yes : ) i meant `` when or even if ever ''
unconstructive answer : use go 1.5
this is with *no* changes from me ; and i 'm using 160 instead of 162 because i was n't
yeah , no data on e4.5
gpu is capable i guess . does increasing opengl to 3.1 also increase the amount of required resources ?
let me check if i can get that scrollbar transparent in some way ... . otherwise we have to do
i was conscious of len ( name )
mucky pup
symlinks ? sure .
?
and after it was chosen as a precise sru system
if ubuntu was installed with a separate file-system for /boot/ you 'll see a grub/ directory .
and is that symmetric ?
does physicalkeysmapper have some logic to ensure you do n't change the volume while your '
.. and it does n't work in draconian networks that allow e.g . only port 80 traffic through . so
but editing sshd_config should be sufficient to change it , right ?
in testworkerreleasesalreadydead
even if you can just do it one-off manually , every once in a while , would be good enough
the job was already done , i assumed it was right : )
i 'll file the bug , you add that to it : )
but it seems like you have the time , you can set up the 256 instance , try it out
fixing ubuntu make has jetbrains changed completely their websites and went to client-side templating : p
who me .. never : p
interestingly if you tap really quickly ( so the release happens before much hiding has happened ) you can get
ddi you have ubuntu before ?
symlinks to workaround the wrong include paths is a good idea
you can use samba with ubuntu of course , if that is your question
afaik , it 's arbitrary json up to some limit in size , so you can put whatever you want
so it 's basically apparmor looks like from a quick search ?
maybe leave the `` single-user '' one just in case ?
you have modify rsyslog.conf to ignore certain msgs if you want
sad .
pls help
how do i make a recipe ?
which one do you prefer , ec2 or maas ?
so just take a look at the logs .
can you confirm what you mean ?
dpkg -- get-selections > /path/to/packageslist
libsystemsettings.so.1 = > /usr/local/lib/libsystemsettings.so.1
you should register the domain now
wrr , *5.10
that does n't make any sense , what you just typed .
i have a p & c induction session . also missing the standup too .
no no , they dont sell unicorn dust .
so i should remove the linux-lts-vivid-cloud-tools-common
alright , good
or answer the question in the bug : )
ya , i see that environment
just `` debug '' is a valid logging config
no , ci does n't run them at that point . they will be run during migration of the package
when/where do you see `` networking disabled '' ?
the live usb gives me the old boot : style prompt only
i would think if you can get that ball rolling , that would be great . you can always go
i 'm also starting my own language : d
how did you install the nvidia driver ?
step can take three values
i 'd like to try an understand how they 've been pulled in .
ok then after you set bios to boot the external only ?
do you hold shift after post booting and before os loads ?
note that you have to set the remote dns in the proxychain config file : )
i had a feeling . basically , my hard drive is paritioned like this : { sda1 : /boot ,
oops , too early morning . ca n't even read whois data properly .
you do n't add the verification-needed tag and it doesnt say to add it there !
so i commented on your last request . i was wondering if we would still want the server to give
it could be that it was late when it happened , now we 're in final freeze
2 tabs of what ? flash ?
sure i can change it . for testing i will do now ...
can you send me the svg file ? i used the png file from the imgur link
current last updated is the duc db time update , we should have the actual date the snap was updated
not now
well we ca n't land in vivid right now right ?
i mean i-n upload , really ; )
my pc crashes
clarification : dropbox , gdrive
1.4.4+git-0~1863~ubuntu15.04.1
hi
filling the space , and problem started only recently around last week ? on 15.04 ?
that would be symmetria
i can make vb6 do things that transcend it 's meagre begginings
it 's supposed to be in the package
so what would the whole commit command look like ?
wich ubuntu version ?
i wanted to send mail using php
well i still have my nexus4 , can wipe that : )
and then ms creates 3 additional partitions before c : - efi + sysreserved + msr
php 7 isnt even final
the .11 changes were n't reverted .
having looked at the askubuntu though , if it happens with a usb mouse and usb keyboard , then ps2
im asking for a feature
well tell me what you 're trying to do and show the output of ls -al and i can tell
uploading before beta would be better if you think it 'll get comiled and in the archive in time and
if you enter the bios and check , does it let you disable secure boot and efi - and enable
the mount command just keeps on loading
no way to fix the mount without rebooting ?
and there 's the new space creation moving ( unused ) subnets to it , yes
ah , mariadb : )
my windows uses efi : s
sudo apt-get install emacs24-nox just to be sure that you know : that version does not support a gui
ok , and ?
just run `` make trygreeter '' . i get a black screen on the left side . clicking the ``
on windows 7 i 'm getting pretty much the same thing , usb pendrives except the efi partition are no
i 'm thinking this may be related to my short battery life . i 've looked around on forums ,
vnc over ssh
off-topic and fud . please stop .
yes , you can do that .
ok , type sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
do you know how to vendor the sources in the pkg tree ?
mmk , anything output from `` ps -ef | grep dpkg '' ?
morning
do-release-upgrade or update-manager , or anything that uses ubuntu-release-upgrader , i should say .
oh i see ... one sec
pong o/
no
such as ?
dump -p
i mean the command is not found
?
yep , ok , i see it
actually , i did follow that guide before coming here . : (
how is life on snappy side ?
i see that now
huh , that is surprising .
my keyboard and mouse are made by razer , and they currently have no official linux support . is that
meanwhile , see simplyseth , not answering your ansew
oh , ok .
4 .
sorry , did n't know that
which is n't a helpful observation , i know . : /
seems to work for me on the shuttleworth one
3 levels to go btw : )
ok , let me deploy it in a local env so that we can try this
heh , easy to try out : )
hey !
and it was upstreamed . the thing what 's happening upstream for 5.4.2 and 5.5.0 is very complex though ,
ok , re-enbling for vivid too : -/
then you wont have to sudo everytime
i got your branch , installed it in my pc
makes no sense trusty wont install
apparently forgot to check all my ppas when updating to vivid
wohoo ! : - )
probably not
nice . yeah i have 3.5 modes semi-accounted for
i 've tested that mp , yes . i 'm going to test separate mps to change the autopilot tests
ok , the channels are created , next importer run should make them physically appear
i mention pitti because you are hitting issues in pieces i 'm not familar with , so it 's hard
into the base plugin
what 3 years old devices are supported ?
does it do more than make calls on the provider ?
fwiw , it is likely worth just finishing the worker in terms of ( an ) interface ( s )
what do you think about the pages being recreated with every importer run
yup , all of those have to
i will bet it 's some library that gnome-terminal uses
daftykins saw him quoting tj to help a user , and it wasnt even relevant
the wired interface does n't work either though .
but i verified that the autopilot tests for webbrowser_app all pass on device
specifically messaging notifications
the path '/usr/bin ' should be the search path of your shell .
i would wontfix it
would it be useful for those attending the meeting to see it ? if so , fill in the agenda
oh awesome
daftykins i have n't a clue . maybe trying to get it to work with the non-working motherbaord 's card
which what ?
sorry that was for harris
do you know how to make it default ?
mind if i ask what you find inconvenient about shell components on layers though ? you could consider each window
actually there is no `` packages '' word in my sources.list file ?
ya . i know . i was kinda assuming that it did n't suck .
ok cool . i am testing all this out in a vm before i go and use it , so
do this . right click on studio.sh , click properties
so , sudo apt-get install gddrescue and then re-run the command , should work , and yes , use /dev/sdb
ta
i used nis in the past , but not active directory ... do n't know how it works
no , but i like to keep production and staging as close as i can ( i suppose i would
kk one moment . i also just noticed uvesafb is being used..
heh , context is removing juju/juju/lease and seeing what failed
yes ...
hello mate
doh
no it wont , it will throw an dhcp request over that interface .
what do you see in breadcrumbs : `` fixed-guide1 '' and `` tutorials '' or `` the hashes.yaml file ''
i wondered about that , never used net is all .
how did you get to this tty , from a booted usb or the install ?
kwin amd64 last 4 failing ones are 3 times 5.4.2 and 1 times 5.5.1
you forgot the $ i after 2437489274
the problem is that vaccinations have never been proven to help
hedgewars
if your first language is spanish , you can also join # ubuntu-es
so it 's slower than it was using windows ?
heh ? openvpn is n't suppose to default that
i 've added a few subnets to it , backed out my changes and i 'm trying to recreate the
no
i am getting nothing with that
so that may give you a clue as to whats going on
id your phone android ?
\o/
hindi language
in my case , for the redis charm , everything is shared , metadata , config , hooks . establishing
i tested elementary and i love it , however , i dont know how why ubuntu login manager dont show
dang..
yeah , that 's good
um
i 'm going to table my second question
i chose the lvm install option without manually specifying anything after that . it basically wrote it as root +
how did you know he wanted a bot 's listing of files ( or whatever ... ) ? !
where is the mr ?
ok , will do . standby and let me load up my vivid box
maybe we just copy in everything and do n't do any markup
or est + 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc .
for what michael and mark have in mind , it 's probably better to actually start the deb env as
whoa that 's not it
it says that it will write existing partitions
i 'll be closing bugs today , but not the tracker as conversations are happening there right now
i am also curious as if this may be somewhat related to overheating or the power inside the usb 3
it worked , but sure , if you like : )
i 'm probably not understanding what you mean then ( and i 'm tired )
a unit test or autopilot for it will be very complex since this involves the most called contacts model which
in ff there is no add exception button man
i like using chromium
^
pxe is an underlying technology
excellent !
if you contribute to the ubuntu core apps ; you will learn a lot on proper coding practices for qml
sudo apt-get dist upgrade may or may not upgrade your packages depending how recently you used the command
now it is there o_o
there probably is one
then 'source .bashrc ' or log out and back in of that terminal and you can just type remote
i replied to yout comment . also , we do n't define a slice of statuses so hard to cycle

there is a process when dealing with windows . defrag windows twice , in windows resize the os partition to
is it booting , or have a _ cursor ?
so alternate is an unknown ?

auch gut , danke !
the reason there are n't many apps in the store is because they have to be made available for intel
someone in # ubuntu-server has the same problem , do n't know what version he is running .
its not just the code , i mean the vision
ah no ... it was locked and the screen of

you had no luck with marble ?
oh , another thing to consider is switching to nose2 which is much better than nose and the future (
you do n't

to be safe use ubuntu-touch/stable/bq-aquaris.en ... or s/stable/rc
lolz
np
so i deleted google-chrome.list.save and rename google-chrome.list to something not ending with .list
my pc crashed
i hope my problem will be fixed when scarlett finish work on 5.2.1 : )
that looks correct to me , assuming the path/file exists in partition # 1 of sda

gtx750
thats a basic requirement in such a situation
i never end up with a paypal login website . these are all the screens i ever see .
no .
if you 're not working on that customer issue ? ^
ok it works with curtin_userdata_amd64 , will test the rest
for me django is contained in the snap
so what would that do ?
kdeconnect pushed
do you understand when you use a bigger block size why it speeds up ?
is pulseaudio muted ?
it should actually auto-trigger , as systemd-container depends on it
ok , type cat /var/log/xorg.1.log | nc termbin.com 9999
that is why i would like you to think about your phrasing and way of discussing/explaining it ( repeating it
ah right , yes that should be a bug please
so ro.hardware should be all good
but can not see anything wrong though
am i lucky
that would be excellent . the new plugin for the sdk really needs to functionality
i. e. add as set -x to /sbin/resolvconf to see what it 's doing and when it runs during boot
actually i had a look at it , did a couple of tests , and could n't find any problem
clearly that 's him
hence i said 'move ' it .
does your irc client do tab completion based on recency ?
try `` service ssh restart ''
excellent , we can be friends .
its in the pending queue . i missed it yesterday
we never set it/override it
ok , not it is better
ask away
typically they 're one screw to take out anyway , if it 's a removable one
you 're using evolution

any info how to get rid of mysql 5.5.41 ? : p
rebooted , still no button
i see
i tried multiple times , and with 2 different sdcards
nope ... all this talk about sis not being compatible with < 12.04 .
true , thats what i said above , kde based distro
hybrid does n't mean they work together : )
\o/
so for the moment i 'll just leave it as an lp bug then i guess
yep , will do so
its in the repos . so you can use apt-get to install it
any wlan entry under ifconfig -a ?
`lspci -v` to see your drivers
unity-settings-daemon only sends a notification in the media keys plugin - which it should

do n't worry , i 'm working through it with menn0
cat /var/log/installer/ ( ca n't remember the file ) will say . but , what exactly is it you 're
yes . or just click the `` install ubuntu '' icon on the desktop of the live environment .
oh
does n't matter looks fine
this is a random test ppa .
i could n't do that without strict supervision -- could you walk me through it ?
i used sudo -i , then installed newer version of ruby , when i sudo -i , the application works
i thought the problem was in state .
`` email is not direct '' let us give a try ... ; )
it was requested as a manual review
sec , in a hangout debugging a charm
dow you know why that mp is not automatically hooked to review board ?
btw , those with admin access for that kind of stuff are ~ubuntu-qa-website-devel
not really . i just noticed while checking the logs for unit test results
i ca n't see pastebin in china . usb
well , no logs for it yet
i ca n't believe that sugarcrm does n't provide an update package for newer php , after all they are

you mean about leightweights ; )
yes
i appreciate the effort , but be careful jumping in as an interpreter , not all of us need or
would you merge that ?
i pinged the people who should be able to see

have a look with jamespage next week ...
i liked how the macosx would keep doing backups behind the scenes . i saw that backups `` claims ''
fsck checks the filesystem , not the kernel or drivers . it wo n't work here .
yes that is normal . what gpu chipset are you using ?
yep ... ready
i never use aptitude but many like it 's options , just a thought .
what went wrong though ? i have an ssd that i split in two partitions , win 8 on one
is this a filly up to date installation ? also `` cat /var/log/xorg.0.log | nc termbin.com 9999 '' please
im the only user and i meant to copy a file to the newdirectory on desktop .

you can get the reverification wiki and attend to the next meeting or we can do it via bug on
what are the boot priority options ?
to put it otherwise : in the tester statistics , only the last milestone build counts towards the tests made
well yeah
nice.. not near oval gardens i guess : )
that can happen sometimes , it 's a race condition between the log rotating and the syslog : / it

did you test other drivers yet ?
yeah , the fix-ftbfs is diff-only-worthy : )

have you installed programs with ppa 's of any kind ?
: ) well , that 's due to the package header comments
might have too . : p
sounds like a sem.js on monday @ nutshell , you going ?
i wonder if that flash tool is available in a ppa

but the .py is basically neccessary .
it encrypts all your passwords in the cloud
are you fixing apport btw ? i am lost with udd
i am
right , but is a juju charm the right method for said software ?
the tests pass though : )
to avoid confusion , or to make it technically easier , i can join the channel with a second username
ca n't i replace it with metacity ang again return to compiz ? though i tested it months ago unsuccessfully
yes , i understand it . and i already solved that problem .
done with kdoctools-dev
that is all the info that is needed for the main report
so we still have three 15.04 bugs about kubuntu/oem ; so you 're saying we do n't care for this
can check lsblk to be sure that device name is right
but it ftbfs in webkit ; -p

it loads up using that , but it says at the starting version 219 screen
which is usually just an exported checkout of upstream at a tag , or similar , but sometimes involves some
does what i 'm saying and doing make sense ?
you ca n't have a file system without a partition , yes .
current type is 0700
i 'll write a test and fix , and poke you again in a bit
hey , if i finish work now i wo n't be able to go to sleep straight away ; p
yep , lines 65 and 197 are your main ones
no , documentaion is documentation
wait for an upstream solution or disable predictive text ?
or i could change the name , and any references to the old name would be compile-time errors
hey , look at you !
yes , it looks like pull-lp-source decides whether the argument is a series name or a version number by checking
# config_dm_thin_provisioning is not set
i skimmed this tutorial and it seems alright , teaches the most usefull things how to manage programs from terminal
yes , please make new cards for these things . if you have any clues about where to start ,
yes krillin 189
the `` build and validate '' in the publish tab should then rebuild it in release mode and create a
what files are you trying to edit ?
so what your saying is you do n't have a cause for these effects ?
i suppose not , but at least when there is such a case now godeps refuses to work anymore
so are you behind in distro updates ?
should i be scared ?
sorry i 'm only helping with reviews for now , i 'll have more time tonight to crunch through some

my mom read me that when i was young cause i loved trains , i still love trains and i
everything seems fien
definitely url-handler would come in handy ...
that 's only part of it
is it really that much better than dpkg installing the manufacturer packages and fixing them ?
that 's one kernel upgrade and you wo n't be able to upgrade the kernel again
k yeah so someone had this same issue the other day
is there a physical switch on the laptop that has the wifi turned off ? sorry stupid question
dpkg : error processing archive skype-ubuntu-precise_4.3.0.37-1_i386 ( 3 ) .deb ( -- install ) : package architecture ( i386 )
if the answer is `` possibly not '' i might implement some changes dimitern and i just talked about and
`` studio_ '' who hangs around here asked them directly for the tool i believe .
if it works in windows then it 's not a bios issue i guess
i 'm using v3.19 , i need update v3.19 , but v3.13 do n't
hmm , sounds like it could interfere with upower trying to do the same on sw
it should correlate with the size of your sda5 partition
what driver are you running though ?
i do n't think that additional information is necessary , except perhaps a comparison between what it was for the
yeah , did rm -rf on the highest level directory from the tarball that did n't have other stuff in
on the phone and locally , i get `` none '' as the app title
eheh : )
are you sure you mean dbus-property-service ?
checking
yes , well in the default examples that come with the orangebox it has a bootstrap script that first checks
there is a log at debug but i can bump it
let me know if you see anymore weirdness , but yes , things should be happening now on music
ok , as i thought , /boot/ ran out of space when the kernel update was installed , leaving a
it 's the output from autopilot run -v
after the video : )
give me 5 minutes to check on systems here
why ca n't you understand that ?
linuxjedi of get-iplayer ?
when jgdx added that modemssorted property , he changed the type we see in the qml tree .
rhythmbox is the default music player , pithos is a nice option for getting pandora streams
and wich ubuntu version are you on ?
not your personal army
worked like a charm with no other software install options
it says
i can give more explanation later . i have to bail out for a bit right now ( real world
what is the error the cat throws ?
ah yes , i 'm on the wrong pc today though for the logs - but there was a guy
enough to create a new extended partition and move all data into hdd and sdd into it .
run for the hills , i would not touch realtek myself , some works some is a real problem ,
android would n't go far without fastboot/adb
no problem . also , be careful with xorg-edgers ppa . i 've had plenty issues with them in the
the bottom bar holding the icons
i also do n't see 18d0-4197 in in /dev or /mnt
or grub_hidden_timeout
libkdeedu ? should do
we are
lol . : d
what player is that
also , have you tried booting it with 4.2 when *all* usb devices are disconnected ?
i tried /etc/rc.local and /etc/fstab ... .did n't work for some reason .
lets not guess if you have a socks proxy server
there is a package for that in the repo
does that remotely ring any sort of bell ?
these ppas are not coming back - and they are not # ubuntu 's problem - please look elsewhere .
obviously , we can have separate win credentials .
a good 1tb usb drive is about $ 750 .
i have mate
start : job failed to start
no it ejects but the system hard locks and since that part fixed was introduced oem-config is somewhat broken .
well , all the stuff i have now can be neatly dropped on top of trunk , it 's entirely
i dk what to do with patches
so we ca n't use the ubuntu.connectivity cpi ?
i'l have to look into it . i thought it was still only being tested in europe for whatever reason
yeah , well ... it 's too late now
as in `` it will have no effect '' ?
cute .
i mean it has this copy because it has distupgrader/imported/invoke-rc.diff applied or what ?
it varies
i 'm wondering why i do n't see that
ack
hello there !
i 'm not , scope is not doing anything qml side . tsdgeos ?
i tried moving the set password stuff in the agent code directly but i could n't find the right time
i figured : d
it 's ok i believe you : )
and that brings me to the `` how to report a bug '' howto wich is the reason i asked
btrfs is a new filesystem available for ubuntu . it is currently marked as experimental , and should not be
yeah . i 'm that guy .
when did you join the channel ?
pushed
yep , i 'll let you guys know . still building ...
yeah , a virtual machine would do the trick for that
i just leave work , when i leave work : )
rm -rf ~/projects/ubuntu-africa/trunk/ { cache , output }
add the xorg-edgers ppa and then install the packages nvidia-346 and nvidia-settings
oops i misread `` apt dist-upgrade '' as `` do-dist-upgrade ''
bans are not about punishment of you , they are n't `` time out '' . they 're about keeping
yep .
so i need both the source files in the dir and the tarball ? ( i was expecting dh_something to
ups , sorry
will that make comparison on two slices work ?
what problems have you been having specifically ?
for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run ; do sudo mount -b $ i /mnt $ i ; done
can you stop fkn talking to me already ! ! !
14.04.3
i 'll continue next week for sure . but feel like having to fix that darn dpr thing
check alsamixer again to enable spdif , no mm , should shoe 00
yes , np
check the manpage and experiment with the options until you get what you need .
exactly , it supports 3rd party plugs
it shows up fine from the linux side , but not the windows side
type sudo chroot /mnt
the comments on the bug go beyond just actions thought
you are messing with /boot and / partitions . high risk comes with territory . make backups .
sgtm
is it something to do with the splash screen ?
i discovered it this morning with is
i 'm guessing you 'd prefer something like notepad++ for your general editing purposes as well , so this should
`` lxqt for example which is wehre the development of lubuntu is headed '' i was right for betting on
ok , but , as seen before , ls -l does not show 'directory space usage '
heh , ok
nope , c++ + sdl/glut depending on which host i 'm using . first time `` porting '' something .
as in ! factoid or ! register
yeah , sadly , seems like a precise only issue
ty
no , i had a ranty discussion about it earlier this week ; )
it is a package i built
i am sorry , am i missing something ?
tell me about your approach
does not work .
i am about to upload 4.3.0-5 yell `` now '' if you have any objections
np . not urgent . i wanted to check something else with you
i play a lot of games on my pc , what does it effect for gaming
ok
i do n't like giving support via pm , and your question is not appropriate for # ubuntu . my
oh , and make sure that the wmp600n is actually in pci1 or pci2 port
and if that 's something that would be merged
how many games are in the package ?
a bad , you hit the staffer rather than troll . :3
i gave him the exact answer he would get from us over at moznet
yes , ubottu and a couple clones are on it .
ah cool . subscribed .
try from terminal : /usr/bin/xfce4-popup-whiskermenu
yes , very much x11
great : p
open the usb and look fpr a casper in there , in home i believe .
loose the attitude
right , utopic has eol'ed , but we 're still doing lts-utopic for a couple more cycles
that 's a very interesting linter rule ... i kinda like it , actually .
trying to understand the change in bug 1437065 -- links aside . whats the difference between 'except fork ' and
ok moment ... i will go to bios
systemctl stop lxcfs works ( no lxcfs process any more ) , but indeed it did escape its cgroup
i already entered sudo -s
why is it not on the image ?
wich ubuntu version please ?
yes , your xorg.0.log , kern.log , dmesg , messages , etc
np , still waiting on si
i 'm thinking of proposing a pr to skip testaddremoveset and testconfigevents
great !
the ci scripts for smoke and ci all just use the standard phablet tools for provisioning the device ( ubuntu-device-flash
yeah
i thought it was supposed to work but did n't see it work in this case
you can show your own recieved keys with `` apt-key list id ``
so prior to 1.6.0 we had code to handle python2 's broken handling of non-text .py files
right . i totally understand .
ok , but which is currently installed - i ask since the logging changed in 15.04 due to switching from
clamav ( source : clamav ) : anti-virus utility for unix - command-line interface . in component main , is
give youtube a try now , perhaps
only if they 're assigned and properly configured on the system - i just gave you two commands to see
poke
every time you boot
are you running this on vivid desktop ?
dualboot is not an issue
it 's on the radar . we 'll get it landed asap
in the middle of last process
do you get a song per morning ?
that 's fine
also , this is a channel for support only - you can chat in # ubuntu-offtopic though
being able to determine what type of filesystem exists inside an encrypted container would be an information leak .
then the big question , which driver ? xd i tried the nvidia-current package earlier to no avail ; but
blast from the past : )
yes , like , install remote and stuff
yes , it made it in
yep
the answer to your question already exists in some eleventy-billion places on the internet .
forget that dvblast for a second . did dvbt ever work for you ? if yes , then how did
ugh .
just 720x720 resolution
the xorg.0.log is always the current session . if you 're in kde in a virtual terminal , it 's
the terminal that irssi is running in has alot to do with it .
so do i have to dd the trailing initramfs from the cpio-archive and then extract it using cpio ?
i 'd have thought there 'd be a method in the acpi dsdt to enable it , but might only
actually no ... because they mostly use pre-packaged uefi packages from phoenix or ami/award , and those companies base the
i 'll test it in about 30 min
guess so
hopefully we 'll have a session @ uos where we can discuss things : - )
i guess there 's only one way to find out
right , let me check
it did n't show up on arch .
i wnt to add a new res to the list
okay , i 'll do it : - )
after the wizard ?
no
that 's right .
errr ... 3 ?
right
have you seen ...
who 's arale is that in the video ?
i 'm talking about systemd service unit type
and so your only ( heh ) channel for notification of watcher problems is the changes chan
that ?
: )
@ when_not ( 'license.accepted ' ) def uninstall_ibm_jdk ( ) : # uninstall the jdk
it is still wip and buggy as we are awaiting fixes in the ui toolkit
dd ?
in a terminal check the most recently changed cups logs with `` ls -latr /var/log/cups/ ''
could we have # ubuntu-uos-plenary the channel that everybody is sent to ?
what you done
it writes zeros to the flash drive , first sector
it 'll be impeded by the ps4.5 outage anyway , since that 's taken out x86 scalingstack
one comma too much , now assigned
whaddya wan na know ? absolutely not about my privates : )
yeah , i was wondering about that ; it 's part of the maliit-framework package though so it should be
checking with martin as i bet you are right
what kind of script and what are you trying to do ?
the menu bar .
no such file or directory
so it looks like enigmail 1.9 will cease support for gnupg < 2.0
i can not see wifi card model in ubuntu
upstream switched to *items for qt 5.5 , for 5.4 it 's *source
the mediatek recovery images have a 512 byte header at the beginning , do n't know why . you can
will do , going forward . at least now i know i did n't hose something playing with my config
< kfkg_ > the server has no display , its in a network center
it should be seeded in live ( and should be moved to main once it is ) .
< 3
the header supposedly sets the topmargin of the flickable to avoid that . when do you have problems with it
try `` gksudo gnome-disks '' from the command line and tell me if it shows up
yeah ... for some reason it was ... maybe cause of the qtsystems-source-src building on it ?
also , is the v4 signing process now mandatory for all s3 operations ?
depends on what program , what sort of form you got it etc
and more of that screwy stuff is coming
that said , i ca n't set alarms on xenial anyway so right at the moment it 's no difference
mv name newname
dunno
but your bug says that both sims show as `` disconnected ''
doubt it . you 'd have to take it to some place to extract the data , and it is
i 'm somehwat in favor of leaving it as is
you can pretty much ignore all of pim
ok , so it all ends up with you going on the hunt to delete thousands of files manually to
lgtm
right . goog reminder .
yep
it 'll need us to ping a core-dev to run the publishing job
oh , i was n't aware it is xsane .
whom ever gave you that link got outdated informations
its very easy : if its ubuntu support ask here . if its generic questions ( and you know its
will it work now ?
oh it certainly depends !
honestly i assumed that skyrider got a rpi2 since the rpi will not work in the first place .
when you try to change resolution you only have 640*800 , that 's it ?
i 'm going through the trusty failures , and fixed a few bugs in autopkgtest ; others like firefox need
great
in wich cases would this be requiered ?
the former , sde , the entire device
good luck sir , encryption or odd encoding , but likely encryption
hmm , try boot
ok , sru it is .
what is the output of mount
sure , one sec
not until now
i selected the partition of sdb and selected the option use the entire drive
yeah , it was *you* all that time along !
ah ! i did an upgrade , but charm-tools 1.9.3 is kept back for some reason . manually installing ...
i know man . may i get a distro with waylad only ?
sr0 is usually some optical drive . you have one of those ?
the most supported phone right now is the nexus 4 , a bq phone , and the meizu mx4
currently in older versions , it looks like /usr/share/nginx/html/ ... is the current docroot , and things get overwritten there
never had konversation crash
the line does not work at all - *.h
there are different channels to explore
`` sudo df -h ''
yeah , i 'd figured that was likely the case . i just like to see feedback . : )
it 's no longer there . it 's only in that patch
well , we always welcome community reviewers . if you 're looking to get mroe in to charming it 's
he did ... .and first i thought it 'll be an exec line , so i made the changes in
most days/times are good with me ; possibly best to avoid tuesdays as i 'm usually out in the evening
g'night .
i was hoping you can help me with wifi
they are not , but we can try the ultimate hack
and you are on plasma 5.2.2 ?
you can go to the ubuntu mate site and get the iso there or install the de to a regular
yes
i mean regular users do n't need the ddebs
the only time i saw bootstrap fail ( on 1.9 ) was when i was not running your branch
what is changing that often ?
i wanted to see about access to a phoneline from a ethernet cable to contribute an app to ubuntu.. a
yeah , i would n't call that `` production '' though : p
the music app

realisticly any source , this is being setup to automate a import of data from a third party .
no i meant your bios boot menu
they gave me second block
but generally , in a virtualbox environment , you are only talking about single-hop for hostonly connections , so there
those are the exact terms but let me explain . when you lose connection , you get notified via a
after we have a chance to better test the fstab change , do you think we should change the fstab
remove the .sublime* dir from your home dir
no , it 's for general text on the page
there 's no way around that .
i 'll show you ; i 'll find happiness in how wrong i was , just so you do n't
after propriety river adn nvidia-prime were removed , desktop keep freezeing after some seconds , it had something to do
ah , the boottest problems ... do we know if that 's just an infra issue ?
we do have badge-counters for all i know ... at least i see them in the settings-icon when updates arrive
go to paste.ubuntu.com
so quickly is still something we should recommend to developers ?
alias something= '' something longer ''
it does n't seem to be producing any log output .
blank spaces ?
glad to be of help : ) just remember : stdin ( 0 ) , stdout ( 1 ) ,
if your system shows 100 % but `free -m` shows a lot free with the '+/- buffers/cache ' line ,
oh , sorry , you said mono . sec .
and i started working on ubuntu make a year ago , so post-lts ; )
i have two physical machines , one is on , there are three containers on it . i have 100
i have the same issues . as the oem-user everthing was fine . now under any video-chip x fails .
hehehe
`` go is the future '' i suppose
ah
sigh .
it seems tweakgeek/ubuntu touch tweak tool will set it to 'staged ' or 'windowed ' , and not back to
yeah , not fully functional though
i doubt
ok , installing the silo to test now
but the 'additional drivers ' tab does n't show it .
ill propose a fix for status right away
can u share link for me
hardware enablement
try eject from terminal
leadership and lease are in flux a bit , fyi
upstrem releases are tagged , not branched .
we ca n't take on the responsibility of running those tests *again* , correct ?
show error messages output in a patebin please
it 'd be $ autopilot3 run music_app
it 's whatever you put on there . : d
you mean the need fixing from ci ?
there 's lots of talk of `` ithcs '' as in `` it health checks '' to ensure that everything
given your output , the perl packages mentioned are installed correctly .
ah , ruby-msql now succeeded
exactly ! like i said , it was working fine last week when i landed the exact same change in
hotspot ?
meh . rsync : p
yes , or you can steal mine .
maybe
can you approve the branch ?
i thought nautilus-dropbox was needed for contextual menu and stuff
sorry . i mixed your issue . only your documents are read only ?
i 'll submit an rt for you since its a group change on a server and i know the details
if you have sudo access , sure
the bits about java and python looked to me like they only illustrated what parts can look like
wisker is limited in menu depth . we use sub-sub menus because we have so many applications of the same

disagree on what ?
see cables or if they can get same ip

when you edit a page , you are in `` draft '' mode , other editors have access to it

add that line
human resources : p
yes ! ur advice was brilliant
if you target vivid the it 's targetted for the nearest vivid ota release
we can work it through then
that 's for downgrading php or ubuntu ?
ca ca.crt ; cert client1.crt ; key client1.key
fgimenez : it 's worth analyzing that if the test is not testing the notifications , maybe we can stop
actually his windows xp residue is interfering . unless he fixes that grub will keep thinking xp is there .
apparently when srt is enabled in firmware setup , the controller hides the ssd being used as the caching device
ca n't wait , pal !
because if we 're going to land it , it will need a thorough review and all
cheers will check it out
the conversion needs to happen , but not having it now wo n't block us from possibly doing the demo
did you see the build log ?
i would think that it 's xfce4-netload-plugin
the naming of the bundle causes problems for the new stuff to find it in the gui
yeah , but that 's a potential critical issue fix
can you throw it in a pastebin as above ?
`` cat /etc/issue '' ?
odd
can you debug the issue ? like putting a breakpoint , call clear , and the field does n't get
issue or question ?
eventful for me as well , but much better now
the package is generated and now i have to install them , but installer encounter error saying dependency are no
does it perhaps give you better error messages if you run the browser onthe same computer as the web server

can you pastebin your /e/n/i that did n't work
can you speak spanish ?

cfg80211 , and eeprom_93cx6 both show being used by rtl8187

tox . it 's client based rather than web based so people would need software , but it does have

just thinking ... could we change mesa to do something like lp : ~vanvugt/mir/fix-1510218 and lose the hack completely ?
i tried but somehow it gave me compilation error . i didnt debug
you run sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
well removing the -d [ aemon ] flag gave me some output - now i have something to work with
click `` join '' : )
the example only shows how to draw it *under* the qml , so all other items are rendered on top
yes , everything works
ok ; when the last nvidia attempt failed , did you have a method you can easily repeat today (
also
so i can test the error path on my account , but i suspect the test will fail if there

which browser does the terminal command `` exo-open -- launch webbrowser '' open ?

no worries , i hope it might help
pretty simple ones , though
maybe find another cable dvi ?
yeh , still beign good to me - not done anything to exciting to it
are you sure about ` [ [ ! $ ? ] ] ` ?
will you ask every 30min ?
then update the website : )
it is a zte modem installation
rtmpdump
you mean britney ?
chris was working with people on that at some point , right ? i feel like we also needed userspace
i see that `` kde-runtime '' is not installed . try `` sudo apt-get install -- reinstall kde-runtime `` .

linux is the s*ittiest os ever & yeah aha next joke : )
dunno what you are using , our bluetooth indicator is the one on the left of the blue message icon
it was removed
sudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/
sounds good
would that be the reccomended way ?
sorry sudo rsync -av ...
so also the params.notsupported
you removed the epoch from the changelog , not the symbol versions
which will do something like if params.iscodexyz ( err ) { return errors.newxyz ( nil , err.error ( ) )
14.10 is end of life , not supported . install 14.04 for long term support .
i 'm running as regular user but i 've also tried sudo , the iso is in my downloads directory
no frameworks will no be done for a long time yet . it is going on xenial which means merges
it does

ok ... that seems to confirm there 's an issue with the usb side ... you 've not accidentally pulled
( i 'll do no error checking , just add it to the device object )
work with the header subclass ? that would be one ( awkward ) way to set the navigation actions then
compare `` the light flashes couple times and never comes back on '' with what the manual says should be
do n't have that in vivid+overlay
did you put your patch in a separate branch ?
eh ? when you make the partition , you 're presented with the label , type , size and mountpoint
if you do get it fixed an dif we hear back about it , it might be worth adding the
syslog would help too
can not write text . keyboard and screen display errors
and usually you want -s too
changing all imports to 1.3 was already beyond the scope of this mp ... .
let me assume you try this on a freshly installed vivid image ?
pong
just confirming that this is what you want
it seems intermittent with 4.2 - now not booted or rebooted with acpi_osi= '' windows 2013 ''

hold it
ok , i 'll repaste
try sudo lshw -c network
any updates ?
this icon-only widget seems like , much like a dock which i 've never been thrilled about . maybe once
but it only looks through directly-seeded entries ( this is sort of analogous to some similar behaviour in apt )
is it not fail ? just wait 15 mintues , it will continue to installation , is it right ?
ubuntu makes use of 'sudo ' before commands .
maybe the # ubuntu-devel guys are more expert at this ?
oh . yes , i did n't backport that change intentionally .
so if there was maintenance , it would n't matter .
ah no my mistake , there is a python3 version , so i 'll fix that for sure
ok , press ctrl+alt+f1 and login , then type sudo apt-get install pastebinit , then type lspci | grep vga
so out of curiosity , what channel to use for mako ?
installing 19 rendered my device unbootable tho
why not 14.04 ?
ok , give it a try . think a reboot make it happen

: ) ok , no worries , i have some theories and will have a look
that has nothing to do with why you think that 'feature ' should be in ubuntu
asus eeepc 1215b
one trick is to pick one thing and just understand how it works a bit more , you can generally
ubuntu 15.04
what we need there is closer from e.g usb-creator
not quite a transcript , hold on i get you a link
changed from upstream that is , cause upstream is to kill by default .
it 's not tiny
duuuude
everybody will guess it is touchpad issue . but not really . i did n't touch
off topic , talk of exploits isnt usually allowed here
the defaults point to emmc
or you could make a terminal launch icon with gparted as command
i get this : fail ! : tst_statesavertest : : test_open_url ( ) 'qdesktopservices : : openurl ( qurl (
probably not : )
probably small clusters only
the only implication is that the code will not have been separately tested against the wily archive in a silo
`` sudo dmidecode -t memory ''
ah ! that was the whole question . is there already a design document somewhere ?
also looking into moving things to vivid , first making sure the vivid environment is working . last time we
we 've talked before but seriously debating working distance now
this has to be the first line of the script for it to work correctly
right , people without ubuntu-standard wo n't get upgraded to systemd ( for now , anyway )
looks like it 's that url s/repository\///
yes , any partitioning tool ... provided it lets you focus on the mbr ... things like gparted will usually
right , say , a general purpose webserver
also , that retrace failed , but neither systemd nor flac libs are in the stack so that 's also
lol you might have found a h4xxed sqlinjection on it
it 's just libraries so in theory nothing
it was nice talking to you : )
it 's not mine
to make things prettier i could surround nativeeventtypetostr and that dlog with a `` # if verbose_debug '' or something
guess a new machine is needed !
yup
and then qtcreator should install right ? 5.3.0 ?
will do in a sec after i get /dev/sda1 unmounted
and do n't call me mate , buddy ; )
i wanted to know why i could n't find it , and i also wanted to know it was done
you can write to the ubuntu-phone mailing list or open a bug report on launchpad.net . this way everyone can
is n't the systemd default mo to violently whack the cgroup it started a service in ? i do n't
looks ok. are the other issues raised about rsyslog etc valid ?
yet , it just fails on ppc and the symbols files are not separated per arch
i 'm tired , my logic is slightly borked .
in fact , google says no for ubuntu on that , no bios only droidboot
well it should still load the env and tell you about that
what benefit does that give us ?
you 'd use the directive dest_module_name [ # ] =
when i remove it with rm -rf it deletes itself and readds it to the folder
no .
cool
i prefer the site ... . i dont have a very large hd
you can probably borrow the checks from the reviewers tools
iirc , the first line of the file is line 1 , regardless of comments .
^^
if it 's for a test , it should get pushed in temporarily via the test , and abandoned at
it was n't me
this must be a bug rather than a genuine spec problem
yea downloaded .
why does grub2-themes-ubuntu-mate have a transitional grub-theme-ubuntu-mate package ? that does n't exist at all in ubuntu ?
if you 're looking at a few specific processors , you could post them here for a discussion
my dvi to hdmi connection carries the digital audio from spdif as well , but it depends on your graphics
that means that sshd is listening and waiting for connections , now check your firewall rules , and lastly your
welcome , what can we do for you ?
tbh krunner always worked for me
im booted into the 10.04 desktop os now .
it still playin but we dont hear nothing
ok
do yo uhave the `` bad '' one ?
and literally nothing appeared in the /var/log/syslog only powerd stuff
just kicked off
did you add sync support ?
works for me .
?
ultimately what i 'm after is a way to detect if xserver-xorg-core-lts-distroname is installed or if xserver-xorg-core itself is there
so we have plans to get rid of the need for ignore-addresses on master
in particular , looks like we 're dropping all aa protection
but there is a chance that only setting btn_touch is enought ( provided that the abs_mt_position_ { x , y
while there is n't an equivalent of mountlist , i believe that mountlist uses various libc functions such as getmntent
actually do n't do it by hand
open a terminal or drop to another tty ( control + alt + f3 for example ) , login and
i got the can not conect to x server error in tty1
exactly what i wanted . it 's awesome . i 've done the same for the back
( on top of passing in the api instead of teh state : ) )
ask me tomorrow , and i 'll do a bunch of no-change rebuilds for you .
i am . it gets rejected
ok personally i would prefer to drop the menu stuff
oh , what ? request_id should be generated for you.. what were you copy & pasting ?
if you 're talking about an ftp client then it depends on your ftp client i guess , look for
we have n't yet prefected the art of telepathy
i was talking to bq today at twitter , he said they are shipping to norway , but for some
i tried to make one once , but the restrictions back then made it rather impossible to use
so installing the nvidia driver from ubuntu repos will ship nvidia-prime too
i entered the pc business when the ibm pc was released : )
i 'll add it on the next agenda
top right u shoud have a star shaped button , you dont ?
what is the difference between share and export ?
2d as invalade odd
hmm , so you want the vivid enablement stack .
have you got it building yet ? i.e . is this urgent ?
of go code ? ...
you rarely need those
if the packaging for cloud-init is done badly , but the packaging for walinuxagent is alright , this will still
adding boot menu entry for efi firmware configuration
okay : )
ack , will make sure i do that in future .
yeah , we will need some changes to the indicator-sound to make it a little more intelligent ( like hiding
i got one of video tutorial while searching in google for firewall , seems checkpoint was very popular and heard
wipi !
hopefully i will have made up my mind by then : )
then you can see in your syslog that its actually started since it wrote to yer syslog
no your not ; )
no idea , i did n't build it
it needs hands on deck : )
not for me , might be because i 'm on ubuntumate
ogra_ ping me when ready
when you added the auto env life assertion to the txn layer did you remove the ones that already existed
the new buteo sync will need some translations if it ever lands
berlin-marzahn gets matched for `` berlin '' for example
heya o/
the three unity8 branches are in a silo . after that lands , we can propose the namespace refactor +
no
when you create the chroot , you should *only* mount the root-fs and bind-mount the kernel file-systems proc sys dev
yeah , that means it 's mounted and something is using it
yep that really is the ops people for the ubuntu.com department , that is being referred to
xxx
for you , anything .
i have n't dived into it super deeply , but i know it 's pretty customizable
indeed !
weird !
it is definitely the exact same issue needing the exact same fix
you did't bind pts maybe ... but i did n't undertand why are you chrooting ...
borderlessmaximizedwindows=true
good luck ... i 'm off to do some kernel testing
what about the second question ?
do you see in the test ?
yes
good point , i 'll do that . other than , the last bit i 'm working on is testing
i guess that was another key that 's set as alt_r
currently the de facto answer is no ; we 've been stalled on refactoring that
remastering a ubuntu iso ?
same here - makes it easy to compare
np , i figured
i put ubuntu sever iso in vmware player.. and click on each line..
yes , that is the thing , i dont like to rely on luck
so install smplayer and play it
?
sounds like another bug
so i should strip the obj-*/ and just leave `` acl-updater/acl-updater '' right ?
there is no space in what i typed.. i just checked again and for some reason it inserted space
bad news ; same problem on 15.10 beta
yah
you also did n't see the assert without the change ?
reset bios password with a bootcd like hirens boot cd
there were packages added to the seed too ?
sure , np
so i just did this :
it 's 2015 , this kind of logic does n't impress anyone .
that one i tried
does that warning occur for any other packages ?
feature branch : )
yeah if you get a new ppa you get to start over with a new orig.tar so it should work
its a channels list , all line are a : b : c : d : e : f :
you mean you had u1 and flickr ?
so i did specifcally on
( i 'm trying to work out if i 've replaced what it does with the walinuxagentshim work )
panel layout , specificall
sure thing .
before what ?
i thought this was about a landing to the ppa ?
kde
so i 'll change the charmrevisionworker to return the error
sudo apt-get install smartmontools pastebinit & & sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | pastebinit
yes , just run that branch in a s390 builder ; is it something that you could do ?
debian stable is a lot worse than ubuntu lts , imho
the odd thing though is that it worked before with this setup , and this is the default way orange
at least depends how you manage your networking
*thats* the compromises , you may have to deal with
i use sudo gedit not vim . add it or uncomment it
it was a good question . : )
4.2 or 4.3 now ?
what is the output of 'ls -al `which pip` '
bug 1410406 ?
nm
paste the output of sudo apt-cache search python-gst-1.0
good morning !
wait , the juju/stable ppa , or other ?
works within 20mins though ...
also not on topic here
my index finger holds the tab button
i spent two days trying to find the cause and i gave up
well , i do n't think so - but it should not spam the logs and restart every 3 seconds
servers ? probably , but i only use ubuntu on my laptop . from what i hear rhel started as
actually , ignore that for a bit
gpg intergration into dekko
happy friday to you : )
did not know about pinning , but seems i got the package
wily only gets very very marginal qa and is not planned to land on any phones
yeah , i wonder if it implicitly has after=local-fs-pre.target , i. e. mounts are only done after that ( but
if that completes without any error then run `` sudo grub-install -- target=x86_64-efi -- efi-directory=/mnt/ -- boot-directory=/mnt/ '' .
i 'm not saying we should n't do the article - we totally should
and network-online.target is waiting for ifup @ eth0.service to finish , closing the dependency loop
looking good then . ok 3 commands *should* get you booted . `` set prefix= ( hd0 , msdos1 )
yes , it is not easy click and play
surely , the init script can call it instead of embedding a copy .
may i ask how long have you been using your tablet ?
btw what linux kernel are you running ? ( uname -r )
its just fucking retarded and i hate retarded things
using xfce - any idea how to do it with that ?
it know when the other line comes back up though , you could force all traffic to sip server via
but even then it 's a pain .
so you added a ppa ?
i was asking if you needed any help : )
the summit happens , right ?
is it ok to set no_new_privs ? ( it is currently being set but it 'll prevent any aa profile
ahhh , you have systemd init then ! `` journalctl '' and scroll through
i did n't get emailed about this
so that it 's done automatically for people .
ok , i 'll look at it , i just turned sound on so i would know when someone messaged
yes , or your ubuntu iso
the idea behind it is , we always doing support but never have real chance to talk 2 each other
is that correct ?
i guess not since i ca n't change the size of the efi partition , sda1
fglrx normally works fine with gnome shell . what problem are you having specifically ?
the more crap migrates , the better from my point of view = )
just does nothing .
im supporting yamakasy
it 's that , yes .
a tradeoff of power consumption for stability is worth it . i just have to test this now , see
support here , chat - > # ubuntu-offtopic
i believe it 's atheros ar9002u
yeah , but we can use the ignore flag for that ( if it 's still there )
concerning the resolve_address function , i do n't see how that could happen ... . ?
do `` sudo apt-get install pastebinit '' then do `` pastebinit < ( sudo lsblk -f ) ''
ok , on mako i can make it work
yes
look at the os build details page in system-settings
its stable yes , but hardware is rather not high-end
i 'd go with `` defaults , noauto '' -- i 'm pretty sure that works..
there is a note in the summary `` fixed with 37596 '' co maybe try with that release ?
if it does the job , i have no objection to that
did you let me make that mistake on purpose ?
they should be pulled in through breeze anyway though
is n't it the same source info in every case ? it 's just that we present it differently
from xorg.0.log : [ 63.445 ] ( ii ) the server relies on udev to provide the list of input
ubuntu version ?
^
most likely they are different options because they are comma-separated
its year.month , when month is either april or october
they mostly broke a lot of things , system was very unstable afterwards back then . only release upgrade that
i only run one at a time
anyhow ... this is an ux change , so this needs to be talked with them
it 'll do that until the upgrader has done its first check for a new version
pretty sure this is all due to timing around the workers that had been asked to start have n't fully
point me to that ? because i 'm looking at the source code in-kernel right now
that 's one good thing about it
oh wow that 's nice !
muon-discover working for you ?
do you get it disconnected from computer but still at home ?
sudo apt-get purge applicationname
yes
not urgent or anything , just a heads up that i filed the bug as we talked about it earlier
try `` history ''
lxle is my current favorite , before that , mint was .
but im helping hunting early bugs so
at this point i 'll try to install grub2
yeah i know anyway carry on .
yw !
i wanted the command line version only
that 's what i was trying to say before , though . i 've tried that and i get dpkg
you free now for a chat ?
well , asking for a feature like this in core is basically tandamount to that
can you make the game log it as a .txt ?
yes , just plying a file here
o.o
stgraber : btw , any immediate idea what breaks overlayfs ( for lxc-start-ephemeral ) on current 3.18 kernel ? i
we have asserts in libqpa-ubuntumirclient.so on startup of unity-dash
but just understand that if you 're adding a presentation layer in the spreadsheet , and qa starts relying on
then you 'll have to make your flash drive up with persistence
there 's a bunch of commits from ci bot < ps-jenkins @ lists.canonical.com > that have it very confused
nvidia 340.96
we 'll have an example soon , then ; )
thx
yeah , might as well leave it like that
and looks like there is a # phpdev
what 's your ubuntu version ? it said 6.24 above
i 'm hoping they sneak a couple of bugfixes along with it : )
raspberrypi2-firmware - 4.1.10-ba7a8fb-1
wicked !
because it defaults to 6
yes sir..i 'm currently running it on x.org x server- nouveau display driver..
i guess they have n't hit archive yet
then maybe . try ' sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ; sudo apt-get -f
why you ask `` wrong ? '' ? is n't the bq usb-id just an mtp-device and/or mtp+adb-device , but
are you opensource ?
nope , something to do with it failing to monkey patch python 3.4.2 correctly .
could be ( i do n't remember any more , sorry )
i suppose there are the imported tests as well
try arch too
i 'm talking about distro defaults . of course i have no issues installing what i want
what to install to run and develop ruby on ubuntu ?
hense the big warning image when setting to dev mode ; )
right
alright so query your log files and check your /var/log/xorg.0.log .
just run systemctl on it 's own to see the status of services , and systemctl -- list-unit-files to show
one more ( stupid ) question ... .once started with screen in one terminal ... i can take it over
but tbh i doubt that it 'll make a noticeable difference
no , my gpu is the 4000 so the i915 driver works with that gpu
: - ) thought it would be fun to try and ask anyway . i usually bugged sergiusens with this
cant find performance mode in there ?
i am sure there are a lot of people but i have lubuntu currently on a laptop that is a
a users home directory should not contain files owned by root
/etc/fstab entries for each partition/device to mount it rw , anonymous ftp internal to the rest of your network .
i.. heard something about it . also a privacy-nerd friend of mine told me to beware of the latest lenovos
where would you check all `` main-mismatch '' in the archive ?
ok
it makes no sense to change imo
it 's running on vmware and the host machine is radeon
cheers
ppp0 is a dynamically created interface name , it may not be the same on your system . use 'ip
has life settled down any ?
i see
i cant paste it obviously , i followed your commands and failed , twice .
i have no idea
i am suffering from time-adjustment issues . i slept at 10pm last night and awake since 6am this morning
ok , that essentially means that there is no way to upgrade from old oem uboot to new one ?
so also `` depends : libkf5people-data blah blah , remove that library from those lines too ?
same error message unfortunately .
that is not the full output .
but , dont over think it , and add new issues into your situation.. just try and isolate and test
you 've disconnected before getting my pong i guess
ohhhh , sorry
no idea
excellent . but wait until i have updated the translations ( probably friday ) .
happy to reject it if there 's no urgency .
i guess that 's what im looking for
basically every version since 14.04
well , if you start `` system-settings sound '' you likely get the same issue
so i probably bungled an edit
yes please , both of them
shoot
yeah it gives us a path that has the album and/or artist in it iirc
should be able to .
the guys who did it were pretty good , i guess if you can figure out the algorithm and port
it is ~/music
sometimes . there are a lot of touchscreen standards to choose from .
during boot , as block devices are discovered , their metadata is checked and if recognised the correct tool is/should
give it a try , the daemon for it may run as root .
however you 've not really explained the ubuntu version
there is a way to submit new factoid data , but ive tried it few times
so , done
that 's it
have you seen ubuntu-africas growth ?
i agree .
i know how to do it , but it 's a hideously insecure way that i do n't recommend -
experimentally this feature will show up `` in a phone '' before end of the year ...
'nuff said .
there 's a deb package there .
yes .
fixed : )
but i do n't have a strong opinion where
i know how to find that information , but i ca n't tell which partition is which
indeed
if none found , it registers in a sharedcontext , which we just discussed there 's no reason to have
what 's it say when you try to mount it ?
how is valac-0.26 in there now ? seeded ?
not easily probably .
unfortunately nothing that pertains to my actual issue .
true .. but i do not know the test plan
that should n't matter
but if your exploring sounds you should definately hit up lazypower
we have a bug for it
so the isdeaddoc assert will cause the remove op to fail if the record is not dead
ssh-keychain and , optional , an integration into your desktop ( gnome , kde , ... ) keyring
however , with the specified `` private overlay mounts '' , snaps can actually put stuff wherever they want again
1 monitor works , when i plug in # 2 , both go black
viola ! ! !
did you test if this is still needed ? debian/rules : drop from -o3 to -o2 to work around a
have you tried i2p ?
done
you 're very helpful . do you know how i might be able to fix flash player in chromium ?
type lspci | grep vga
are ou pressing the shift key immediately after the bios//post page ?
is this in a vm ?
i doubt it is as simple as that.. somehow i got an old source tree so i 'm `` reverting
but my subjective feeling was that stuff got worse , let me try again
systemctl status local-fs.target does n't say which dependency failed ? it shold
i have n't managed to do that yet , would it be something you would be able to cast an
k
wait
we have to : )
is there any way to manually check fix in silo 53 ?
danchapman : so it needs to work for those as well out of the box
with what exactly ? you both said the last thing 15 minutes ago
i see , damn
well , the bios comes in a exe
jenkins failure - vivid-adt-nginx 42
machine learning stuff
new features are sometimes backported to earlier *buntus . if it 's a feature you just ca n't live without
repetitions are not liked here ...
mixing 13.10 , 14.04 , and 14.10 repositories is n't a good idea
what is src for
shoul be
actually , i 've just remembered that i removed that conflicts/replaces in 331 to fix lp : # 1247736 .
it is in the instructions and swiping between pages is kinda common to all mobile operating systems too . but
could you try an ota8 reset to defaults , maybe were lucky ?
so you do not know ?
one branch got updated in the meantime.. approved now
ogra_ , how/why is that different between ubuntu-core and ubuntu-desktop-next ?
indeed . how shall i put this ... tax limitations measures that whilst legal , one may find distasteful
or the intersection of people who use this driver and lts kernels .
: - )
so you do n't have a separate /boot or .. ?
that is not what i asked
i can assure you that i 'm an actual person . ubottu is a bot , however
you mean lack thereof ?
did the program exit after that ?
go does n't have them because you do n't need them
either by using wifi or ethernet cabling .
installing kubuntu to/ and then setting ~/ as a mountpoint in the installer partitoner should n't add much time to
there is a lifecyclewatcher
untar ... then run : click build day-d/
what ar eyou trying to do ?
there is no installer for vivid for this port ; )
what sets the $ f variable ?
also one action lazypower was going to take is to file a bug against the charm that is failing
that works for me , we could modify the build script to choose which build to integrate
try it in the run command/ktunner
bzr is not stagnant , just does n't have as much clout or press as git
see qtquick plugin , they export the same components with revisions , and qml documents are the same for all
indeed -- a88a..
you could actually back it up , zero fill it to force every bad sector to be found ... then
and if nothing 's there then it failed to tell juju to add those services to those machines
herm ... when will i know when my own gpu falls behind ?
oh , sure , a logtail should never be more than a few dozen kb , or you 're doing
is lts giving you issues ?
becoming quite the celebrity . better not let it get to your head .
of the ci dashboard ?
me too . my last thought was to bootstrap an ubuntu env , bring up a centos machine , run
of course you can . just boot the install media ( usb or dvd ) and use the installer
did you see that being fixed up upstream ? 31b33dfb0a144469dd805514c9e63f4993729a48
yes , so dd is the limiter here , rather than pv
odd ; can you tell if the hook grabbed all prs , or only the last one ?
why if the permissions are rwxrwxrwx everywhere . i did n't do it , it was like that automatically .
theyre not good , run
what says that ?
but in the typical case , that is how you assure the integrity of the updates
if there 's *any* doubt we should do that same for names
can you respond to the question..
but you 're also correct that it used to work , now the ux is slightly worse - i guess
sorry . irc notifications broken atm here .
as noted above : privacy settings
right , sorry , i was checking the ones attached to the bug
i will try it
oh , okay . nice . : )
the ubuntu7 upload is terrible , the rest looks fine
: d
i 'm in moonstone now if you have a sec though
i mean i know diddledan just lost again if he followed the link and who ca n't follow a random
fancy pants !
let me look into that tomorrow , today it 's already a bit late : )
looks like `` sdb '' has snuck in before the shebang
if you check with iotop or top you might be able to see top processes ...
there are only two tests in that suite
you installed without internet ?
i though you could list specific files in writable-paths
and it is n't a simple case of not having accelerated video drivers ?
i just checked the script source-code . i found this option and can not understand why the revierer got this
yeah ... no chance to do a wifi scanner confined atm ... this one only runs unconfined ... so make
i mean , i 've never done it myself , and unity can be sort of finicky about what it
can you tell me if the following work :
you could try to also add : dwc_otg.dma_enable=1 dwc_otg.dma_burst_size=256 ... i just read that this should improve things alongside disabling
comfortable with c++ , gtk , qt ?
well likley , though it is odd it is n't parameterised with why it is being run
where u from
k1l_ : i said to him that an swap is n't a good idea to put on usb . he
i get `` umount : /dev/sdb3 : not mounted '' when i try to unmount it
my point is you should *not* rely on the local copy of the doc ( inside the state.ipaddress ) when
raspberry pi is nothing like a phone
y u no sleeping
it sends what 's sent to syslog .
okay , no problem
yeah that function is fine..i miscalculated..
what 's on those 120gb drives ?
by try & error .
\o/
is there a way to make it have that optoin like something to install or ?
yeah
is the nic seen , just no network detected ?
ok , i 've found the error , i 'll pass on the details for it to be fixed and
if not that , then in the same general vicinity , yeah
sure
in # ubuntu-meeting usually
it might make more sense to look at the control panel source then.. or whatever tool it is that provides
that 's prettier is n't it : )
we could skip the test ... or just remove it from proposed
do you have the rpi2 oem snap in the store as well ?
or to have it exported beyond : export java_home= '' ... '' - also only for running session
yeah , it 's 180
i told you some time ago
yeah , that 's so much easier to do in c
though we 've started a process where that changes
not backingsubnetinfo specifically
done ; )
yes , it gets installed by default , but it does not work .
thinking lubuntu .
yes , if it was added for convenience , it 's not correct
i am creating a second glib main loop instance and this messes things up
overall it 's going well , there is a crash in here t & c when launched from the wizard
i was gon na copy & paste something but then ... kernel panic
yeah they must not be in main yet : (
what sort of tricks are you doing for those speed ups ?
by calling the provisioner preparecontainerinterfaceinfo which requests an ip address from the provider and associates it with host nic
* nod *
nice to see some contributors have been busy during holidays ; - )
: - ( oh
maybe do the name dropping after the tip though ...
i thought i read that there is some duplication that needs cleanup first ? but maybe i misread ?
and you login as the user nlev ?
well , adb shell does n't work when i am booted into ubuntu on the device , either
so he was saying it just has n't landed ?
well , very little besides qt
most storage systems have no idea of what a file is
do we actually have a separate upload pocket for wanking wanker yet ?
we could ask jujusvg folks to tag our revision 28683402583926ce903491c14a07cdc5cb371adb as v1 maybe
restart ssh server
it should n't affect it , but i can test it , yes
idk mac ... which vnc viewer ?
omw
i 've not seen email notifications for them since ...
why not ? it 's supported
the best way around this is to try to -- force destroy that environment
this was the way i tried > ( etc/passwd ) username : ( blablaignorethis ) : /home/username : /bin/rbash
be fair though , you did change you name by deed poll to `` ; drop tables ; ''
with a ssd that system still should be running fast . so see `` free -m '' if you are
that function would get called ... .when an input came down on the fd ?
from your description , i can not immediately guess the cause .
however , if those blocks include an intact directory chain , the filenames will be recovered
the problem ( wily , and x ) is that you always have a dependency on a versioned python3 interpreter
are you still in the install or you booted a live usb ?
seems to work ... but let me let me device go to sleep for a bit
hah , so elopio did n't squash : -p
how so ?
it should yes ; - )
i 'll do it the sad way
fwiw i would n't recommend running from a flash drive at all ; definitely do n't create a swap partition
apt ? not apt-get ?
hampton roads area
to get more information out of that , try sudo apt-get install unity8
currently at 50 successful runs in a row for `` right-up ''
^
oh , but you want 2 separate archive i see
i remember , but that is n't quite right
ah ok good , try a 1080p youtube to test
ahah , for sure ! just wanted to know if you encountered that and have some tips for me
it should just install
the provisioner *already has an environ* -- surely it should not be farming environ calls out to the api server
trust me . you will see that user again in 3 years , still on 14.10 and wonder why she
thats how its supposed to look !
of course not the .24 one
no errors ?
brought the page up and it has the following message : sadly , fans of our shows and movies in
has any of the file-systems run out of space , or inodes ?
were are always serious here mate
no , vivid is in feature freeze
is ur desk titanium ? : d
i 'd rather have the directory and files owned by the developer , and make sure the www-data user or
the account just does n't save .
seems a little unproductive , always utilize upstream
and then open the file with ( e.g. ) `` firefox /home/rory/desktop/photoprowess/index.html '' ( obviously your path will be different
ok , type ls -l /mnt
ok , i will answere th mail , then
i also .. retired on a fixed income .. and ... well i like it that-a-way ! 1st time in
hi
we find a lot of times in a release upgrade that many ppas have no support in 15.04 . ta
brilliant .
if i upgrade would i lose my data ?
did that
how about `` sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock '' then `` sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a '' ?
those are each individual folders , so perhaps your username was 'ducky ' - maybe you 'd be better off
webkit is deprecated . you should be using oxide
has there been changes to launcher backend in vivid that are not in rtm ?
no it 's only an actual xorg.conf - the rest are ok. try `` sudo apt-get purge nvidia* `` and
aww , nuts , it does n't appear to be 'stable ' -- your url did n't work for me
it just finished building , i 've not checked yet
ah , yes indeed -- getty.target wants boot-ok , but this runs after multi-user ; maybe newer versions accept this
man setfacl/getfacl/acl
i have no doubt that it 's a me error
i 'm not suspecting anything , just that if dac allows something , mac might not , and apparmor (
i meant make usb .
( i see no errors , when i install nvidia-current , when its compiled )
no , it 's an adaptation of how wily works
always : d
just refreshed that changes file if you 'd like to have another look
i tried..no luck
will do ! tyvm : ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
do `` pastebinit < ( dpkg -l 'linux* ' ) ``
that 's what i 'm trying to do : )
ok , mail sent to translators , so we should see them arriving over the weekend .
no , it does n't .
when you login here .. does the desk top start ? degraded graphics is ok at this point .
ah , yeah , the brewing naming system
i dont see any networks : (
huh , that looks like what i 'd expect
( i 'm using this as an example i work on right now , it 's not made up on
how can i emulate the startup of the service ?
that 'll be due to the gpu not being correctly initialised . could be flaky gpu memory that needs literally
o/
or , you can also use # ubuntu since its not related to ubuntustudio specifically
just wrote the mail - so no answer yet : )
glad you made it ! : - )
which kdenlive version did make it into 15.04 ?
i 'll leave you a message via nickserv
check in /usr/share/themes/yourgtk+themename/gtk-3.0/assets
sure , that shows you the version actually installed and , at the bottom , the official repo-version
here simply all windows should be closed and notification icon placed back on panel systray
transparent squid does n't substitute the need for working inet . still need basic ipv4 for dns and connectivity to
alot of things fail mate
sometimes i preempt to get a silo early while mps are being prepped and such
oooh , look at mr fancy pants fixing his build by ignoring errors !
but in every similar piece of code i 've seen , when an error is returned
i tried that . no success unfortunately . it 's not working .
it 's a question asking why they are doing that ...
is that alt+f2 ? i can not read because its too small
unrealircd would do the trick for less users
yeah the tests are not fully in shape yet
no worry
with `` makefile '' you mean debian/rules ?
if i installed 12.04 from original discs and installed pacemaker what would the library versions be
try to install the `` linux-image-generic '' and see what is blocking it
ok , run `` dpkg -l|grep tcpdump|awk ' { print $ 2 } '|xargs sudo apt-get purge '' *
did you run into instances where this code was not being run on > = 1.23.2
i 'll take the bug report , let me know if you have any questions about the test modifications i
indeed !
i guess pr.. sorry , was n't thinking
path and libraries will be all reffing whatever is in your install and stage dir if not
when you get the chance please get the gsettings mentioned above
fantastic ! : d
12.10 is eol
yeah , that system is in the lab , i can only ssh into it now
on which hardware do you try to start ?
already got that in environments.yawl : )
i checked , it only has the templates and translations for the apps we need
imported
depending on which init system is installed . if it is regular upstart then simply `` echo 'manual ' |
i would suggest you just start with the most basic desktop file you can and build it up from there
you have joined an ubuntu support channel mate
well i changed sources list and got utopic 's package ( and a few others ) and no breakage yet
are you saying , if i stop an instance and do n't run ha straight away , but wait ,
too many things to do : ; -/
lspci , will list your devices
howdy
could n't use a modem over the old analog network ...
yeah
i 'm watching it on a foreground terminal : )
what app makes the sound ?
yes
symbols generation seems weird ?
playing pf locally ?
search the `` this is my fancy conky desktop '' websites or threads to get that config files from others
i was basically pointing to your answer lol
then restart daemon , it will logs to journalctl
tks
we will always get lo whether it 's there or not
so lvcreate
bug you commented on , has nothing to do with a chroot upgrade problem .
well , no the router would n't allow duplicate port assignments even if i tried
what he said is that you get a large gap between your finger and the top of manage dash
yep : , i got
hahaha
still , should be deferrable work
re-read what i said before getting on your high horse
did you try what i gave you ?
as otherwise we 'd end up in a big trouble once some design changes teh whole structure
i get that . i 'm just saying that might be counter-productive .
no , at grub menu 'e ' key for edit - > boot parameters screen , in the line starting
ubuntu @ ubuntu : ~ $ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi
is that the maas server vm or one of the maas vm nodes ?
i agree that turning it off right now is a good workaround , but would be nice if you could
so ?
i feel like someone bought me a new studio , and all i changed was the software
out of interest what machine are you booting it on ?
thus , where i can find this information or statistics ?
hmm actually it seems like it might be our issue after all , we should depend autopilot-qt5 instead
nope .
as the entire thing gets marshaled and unmarshaled to a byte slice
if hypothetically , you were the new maintainer of deployer , where would i submit bugs ?
until i touch the file , open ( ) works well
make some toast
what was/might be the problem ?
think i destroy my enviroment for nothing : p
take it as fact when 5+ of us tell you the same thing : )
i know that : )
what press ? t_t i lame sorry
also depends on when that 20 min ingestion starts
thx . eta ? workarounds ?
right , now the apt-cache policy command
uname -a | nc termbin.com 9999
./debian/rules update ; debcommit ; bzr bd -s
i can see your test
names i forget films i do n't : )
i found this ... which seems to indicate that yes , it was init -- > upstart -- > systemd
pass , em is all partial differentials which are above my comprehension
you would publish to myapps
yeah repeating the same text does n't offer anymore of an explanation . i 'm ignoring you now .
its not a service
alrighty
that was really , really stupid . do n't use r and f with a delete when you do n't
the thing is i cant do that . so is it possible to compile it somehow so that it doesnt
cool , turn the swap on and it will hibernate , you should just change the swappiness to 10 per
yes
qtcreator -settingspath ~/.config/qtcmaster
are those the result of what you and ogra debugged this morning ?
try xfce
please elaborate ; your question or issue may not seem clear or detailed enough for people to help you .
right .
we 've worked out that *part* of the problem is that `` ignore-machine-addresses '' is broken for lxc containers
same : )
yes im sure you have to notify the whole channel about that
no , i recall several months ago that uefi had to do smth like that .
he 's keeping me busy : p
what make/model of pc is this ?
ah , the title was ignored by my eyes : - ) i thought we just wanted to support forking
this one fails : failed : ./_integration-tests/tests/80_test_failover . because of the no reboot file we are touching , right ?
now
not really - too detailed
the screen shot shows an edit menu , where is it ?
some say yes , some say no
it updates the voyeur with a integer
well 13.04 is definitely not supported here
hahahaha
ahhh good point
dobey has historically had horrible times with ap , and is experiencing some interesting behavoir atm
and hello to you as well : )
i have been messing with legacy all this time .
it does indeed . it 's complaining about matchers and dbus not being in my fake
awesome !
so , could you please remove address-book-service packages from silo 11 ?
you tell the script the version you want . you have to know that from elsewhere . you 'll soon
but it is same thing when we upload image on libre office to upload or insert image dialogbox
that 's not mentioned in the man page
if ya wan na to get rid of it , ys
are both interfaces in the same sub-net ?
maybe not right now , perhaps in the future he will correlate
switch to a vt
how old is the laptop ?
so ... while you can give ubuntu a 12gb swap partition
it will be ok. how can i install it ?
done
yes
i can access other ttys and tty7 still shows lightdm
yeah , lol
well if mathematica uses all the cores , you might get it with a quad , too .
you can turn that off in debian.master/rules.d/s390x.mk do_zfs=false sort of thing
/etc/hostname should contain nothing other than a single name . `` foo '' ... or `` bar '' ... or
well , you just nuked the computer 's ability to find remote web addresses ( port 53 udp , dns
install ubuntu 12.04 and it will work
search iu.edu indiana.edu iupui.edu ads.iu.edu
well , upstart is the init system , and also the sysvinit-utils package replaces the sysvinit package ( so does
yes then update frub and reboot
# ubuntu-meeting-2
hmmm , are the passphrases the same for both volumes ? if so , that would be expecteds since the
absolutely , its just a trikier way to add users to sudo , if you use the 'admin ' group
hey , sure , i can add you to the permission lists - do you know the essentials of how
e.g : `` modinfo -f parm nvidia-340 ''
also make sure bios is set to ahci instead of ide for ssd
so there is a 'long ' form `` -- user= '' and a 'short ' form `` -u '' that
whats the regression potential of this change , i see it barely changes any old code .
not urgent but nice to have and useful to understand how things happen
yea
we missed ota8 but we are working with upstream , fingers crossed for ota9 : - ) lol our side
what i 've just noticed is even weirder - i see exactly the same number of tests passing ( 1245
this is the usual procedure , right ? ; )
you forgot '.2 ' in the destination .
yes
( ie : dba 's upstart handling always assumes that system upstart == only upstart )
i believe that is true
paste the output of `` mount ''
you mean flashplugin-installer ? which release of ubuntu you are using ?
ok cool . `sudo mkdir /media/windows`
o/ ... after the discussions about content-hub on g+ , i was wondering if you could confirm the expected behaviour
that 's with a run which produces a corrupt video ?
so just use a wrapper script you are pointing to .
btw , what tz are you ?
fair point
uio.no has 10pib or so ranging from ssds for the hottest part to tape ( 40 % ) for anything
does n't that work only in ubuntu ?
the dbus daemon itself does n't seem to be starting ...
no . log out . choose a de . login
no idea not familiar with code base
is it fresh installation ?
yep , but browser
only to a bootstrap archive used only for build-deps .
well and what was the error msg then ?
dunno what happned , well , ty .
not really , because you 'll document the property in the component , and will be ro
we should n't put it back until that issue is fixed
ca n't reproduce it
ooh i know , tell us what `` pwd '' returns
ah , glad its not pocket specific
or the list ?
i feel safer knowing you have everything under control
free -m
-p causes adt-run not to work ... meaning that i can not get a full test run ... as it
yes i have cropped and send you before after photos
that 's good idea ! )
yes
then why are you asking in # ubuntu ?
back around then the system bios were not as functional as they are now , with regard to boot devices
you can apt-get source < package > and look at < package_dir > /debian/control if you enable the source ,
you did n't install it from the official repos then : )
thats why they changed it - quite annoying , but unless you have legacy scripts that use ethx naming ,
tried it out , yeah
again : only if you use windows . only .
i use it in one of my interview questions . windows dc time being incorrect for long periods is not
so is there any possibility two computers in world generate same public key ?
yeah that could be reported better i guess . right now the error just goes by the first wrong thing
i keep meaning to file a bug , will do when i get a moment . yes , vivid
yes i do
the /home it 's not your home /hme/user . i'ts owned by root
so read the answer in that post carefully and see the fixed permissions and ownerships there .
keep raising awareness ovidiu-florin ; i have a site going online in sept. for all the different kinds of code
- i figured , but when i first configured it , it crashed the configuration cause it was looking for
i 'm honestly telling you that thinking that is the cause is 100 % false , it is something else
there is no /etc/x11/xorg.conf file anymore by default on kubuntu
i know , it 's just hard to follow what has happened , and what you have done . i
sure , i promise that will be in the very next pr i put up
to the best of my knowledge , they will be sticking with unity but they will be doing a major
that 's wrong , grub goes to the main disk - not to a partition
i do n't think there is anything written specifically with scopes in mind
np ! it 's been fun writing them
yes . is that not recommeded ?
will do -- i should mention that i have created an lxc container and there are some virtual interfaces listed
yes .
your xorg.conf , also
if you want it in an lts , you 'd have to go with 16.04
yeah , that 's fine to get us up and running a bit better : )
let me do a little research to see if another key in the index.json would work . can you think
: - (
boiko : k should be good to go
kay . because of the ordering issue mentioned , it was really hard to see if the delta was breakage
yes !
or is it really a very basic error where logging would n't help anyway ...
it 's a bunch of one-file projects , i would rather not write makefiles .
the onboard debian also uses g_multi , so i 'd probably poke at /sys/module/g_multi/parameters/
i actually am having fun : ) txx
yeah
but if the types are exposed , then i have to figure out when i need the constructor and when
the diff is changelog and a patch in ./debian/tests/patches . no change to ./debian/rules , ./debian/patches ./debian/control , so it
evil draginses awayes
ok
my outrage was mostly to troll seb128 : )
sure
'udevd ' is the user-space device daemon . it receives device state-change notifications from the linux kernel and configures/notifies user-space
all those , plus weather reboot is under way , as is calculator reboot . both quite advanced .
^^ ... .when the keyboard stops responding , do that .
where ?
nope , regardless , uitk does n't seem to respect parallel= or -j on dpkg-buildpackage
no , i was thinking more about building snaps
choose a password that 's easy to type : )
that fixed release ralte to trusty via a ppa because mate is n't in the official 14.04 archive .
excellent
what was the fix ?
right
ok , in recovery tar up /data/system-data/ and /data/user-data/ ; that 's all your data
i *think* so .
there is one other way
what a mess : (
and also bad b/c constraints and settings are multi-env so really should have the env-uuid set
its not in the software centre
well maybe it 's because they 've had no luck finding it down here on earth .
yep , typing a patch as we type..err speak
the update the killed the box was a normal ubuntu update .
it breaks my workflow
: /
i agree . i can not with any reliability land slices of the stack without having first coded the entire
with you here , sure : p
how big is it if you compress it ? it should compress a *lot*
oxide , i have n't come across that yet .
well that looks good , both uploads accepted
not much
and the description on the spreadsheet is that correct as well ?
yeah , i poked it a bit but it seems like there is more to it , i.e . seting
nothing for gazeteer , lots of stuff for `` score '' but note the gazeteer app
yep , upstreaming will take a bit more time , but i am talking to bfiller to check if we
linux does n't boot from ntfs does it ? ... the only way you can do that is through grub4dos
echo > 12000 cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
: ( 'released to manufacturing '
i 'm not an expert , i simply made that observation from the pending sru pages
you mean live-usb ?
if one could construct a small test case that would let us pass blame one direction or the other ,
in case you did n't notice , i fixed the emulator last night
850evo here : )
maybe the # # programming channel can help ?
toykeeper has a different one to me but it has the same chipset , but she does n't have usb
ha , confirmed . i set my scrollback to unlimited and now i 'm watching /tmp lose space
the mako driver lives in /android and libhybris proxies into it with its own libglesv2.so
for what purpose ?
i 'm thinking that most geeks have a terminal set to be easy to read for them , so why
yeah - no existing `` find all ips for a machine/subnet ''
does the update from ocaml 4.01.0 to 4.02.3 require rebuilds ?
will do when i finish tearing my hair out with bluez5 that was supposed to be so easy because we
we 've also got a release we 're working on getting out that fixing some routing so might be fix
would recommend either taking some time off or stopping one thing
why are you trying to upgrade if they are saying they have patched their version
can you propose it ?
one big part , just like when using go .
btw , that seafile error , if the queue follows its natural flow the fix should land before the test
fixed ?
yeah , that 'd be the only option right now
red ?
in your home , you dont need sudo .
uugh , i see some problems with publishing , one moment
maybe it needs 'nolock ' in the mount options ?
okay good ,
can you give me example hard link files in system uses .
you do n't happen to know which distro comes with gnome do you ?
as for the packaging , as nm is a packaging only branch , that 's all i modified . i
check if 2.3.2-k does support the i217-v .
right - boot to the menu - install not try
hm ?
yeah exactly , that 's why i was so confused , but it looks like a third party app is
alf has been testing a mir change , and he noticed dash suddenly performing better than before
damn
excuse me ?
i can go in and make your suggested changes
but before that ; have you check the hash ( checksum ) of the installed image on the usb itself
but you would have to submit a new request
nm-tool
sweet ! no worries
yup
i have the asus rog g46vw , i have tried the usb on another computer and it seems to boot
why is that branch named kubuntu_vivid anyway ?
yawn ! : d
: ' (
no worries , just trying to get up to speed
cant remember ...
which ubuntu did you install ?
i assure you that a discussion about the meaning of life is not ubuntu technical support .
what is that for ?
you speaketh of windows ways , shame on you : p
+1
it is done , then ?
right about where the cursor is
yeah . is that really a problem though ...
do n't worry about the touch , i 'm working on the ofono override for touch .
the reason you ca n't save is cause you are n't www-data
i tried that , but it did not list anything about wine
ok so in a dual silo , that behavior is undefined , because the train is n't able to do
on what list ?
wich os going on it ?
i 'm going to look at the test failures first
you have to make free space . read the wiki
does `` ps -ef | grep zeit '' show any zeitgeist procs running on regular ubuntu systems ?
how did you format the drive ?
no

you can enable logging for the sftp subsystem in your sshd_config
but kscreen likely derives its xrandr settings from ~/.local/share/kscreen/*
hmz.. nothing
sorry , do-release-upgrade -d
there is no sshd installed in machine
i will depend on that then
ok , i give up , how do i tell then ? : )
i like xfce the best , it has been around a long time , and was the default in debain
i ca n't do that
i would n't trust them for writes
ah , i see what it is
import qtquick.controls 1.3 does n't work on utouch , because it ca n't find it
qt3d-oepnsource-src-gles depends on qt3d builds of matching versions which are no longer satisfiabled ? !
take the dates out of the changelog entries you are writing . that is my official advice .
anything else in the log ?
photorec
no need for that , there are no any files on this that are important ...
meaning , i can remove the property and it would still work ?
what kinds of fullscreen games are you playing ? are they native games or run under wine ?
did you type exit ? and it said script ended ?
looks like a ci issue
possibly the syslog for the period when the app is running , this will tell you of any apparmor denials
i even tried setting different vga=xxx options in grub
icons in menus

due for final release tomorrow ...
unlock your device and use apt-get install an-ftp-prog
which is akin to pip install $ stuff
no
action is a generic thing , coloring is the control specific part
i have been assiduously ignoring that i get lie-ins now
yes
ah , alright
the key combo alt & tab opens an app switcher
please use a pastebin type service , and give the full command and output
ah . no , i was asking about the schedule change
by removing ~/.config/vlc it should work again , restart vlc after that .
look for `` tst_i18n : ********* start testing of tst_i18n ********* ''
or we do n't need a timeout .
yup
let 's start again , you want light table to be associated with what ?
ah , ic . because i really would like to be there too . i love sfo .
me neither ... it is new to me
this is why people think oss is n't enterprise-reafy . the bugs we know about are n't fixed .
which clinte are you using or u prefer
that 's a good thing though , right ?
cd /etc/x11 and check for xorg.conf and sudo mv xorg.conf xorg.conf.backup
i may follow up your email with a chaser one saying that 's an option , but only for wily
no , i 've to search in the logs
is pulseaudio installed ? what desktop ?
yeah , but createformfield looks hard
that 's odd , do you have any logs ?
well , two ; being : ongoing tasks :
which ubuntu version ?
os=operating system is this ubuntu you 're using ?
yes it is . what i thought is that we have about 4 bugs that we agreed on for vivid
then type sudo apt-get update
how to fix it ?
run `` sudo apt-get -f install '' now
yes : d
are you trying to install ubuntu to disk ?
ok :0
ah ! ok. are you using it on the bq phone ?
try removing the cache
how do i reduce it to one ?
why do you think it 's installing grub to your sd card ?
so , there is a workaround
sunny scotland : )
yeah , looking the other way around
i 've also added that to the bug as a comment .
i have a new option in the part right before that screen
so my question is , should we really be splatting out a k/v map , or should we just extract
the guide seems solid . give it a try . good luck .
yeah that 's why i was wondering what to do , how do i know if it will fail again
it 's seeing somebody ( itself ) mentioning bug # and goes
yes
btw , what 's the missing thing in the mediaplayer integration ?
right , and i did n't add it to the main header . nor did davidcalle . weird
i do n't have the context for the soname change , i guess , unless it 's to support upgrades
`` checking which boost to use ... external '' -- so at least its not using internal boost . still
paste needs to learn how to color patches with a patch ; - )
now it succeeds : -/
actually scratch that . get you ubuntu usb/dvd and reinstall grub = on the theory that you have a kernel
it 's not a trivial amount of work , so i 'd like to understand better where this will be

when you log in it opens kwallet so you do n't have to open it all the time with a
that 'd be cool , there are lots of things that could use this
it 's not visible from xbmc on that device . can you see it those directories from another ? depending
i have some things to fix from dimiter 's review anyway
which is one extra db write/read-result , on the same doc , every time we write status history
i do n't think it really matters , which is not the same as saying no one cares ; )
we have an oder bootscript if you like
then learn ; )
probably not a high priority for the beta , unless cyphermox 's other fixes magically fix it .
you should probably be able to just create a new pull request with a different target branch ( i expect
that would be a suitable action item imo . then we can keep talking on the list .
usually the team lead or manager sets it
^
and what is up with the didier roche : netbeans and rust & jetbrains clion and twine game editor support
from a signature perspective ... not implementation
i 'm not that stupid
i change it and now i see it in the fstabdaftykins : what must the sudo service smbd restart
this is n't a mint channel not an xfce one
take the chit chat elsewhere please , this is support only
wrong link ? i just see a code listing , nothing to `` try out ''
having all that jammed into a tag
right
so they can use those metrics to set their app size
ah , i used -- suffix=v5
i mount device in mtp ... i do n't see the phone in disks utility
freebsd
have you made a new .symbols file before ?
i 'm on debian unstable
alrighty .
been there , done that
vivid only got 3.9.3 yesterday : )
wifi ?
just ask the question
the way you say onboard , what hardware are working with ?
other people have stood up to replace riddel . there will at least be a 16.04 , and i suppose
cool
i did and it was mounted
r188 has the fix if i read correctly the url i just shared
yeah , hiya
and let 's ask zbenjamin too
uhu ; )
my bad , i 'll head over there
oh , the epub one was nice , the pdf one fails .
je suis en france
work fine here , it breaks plasma or panel only ?
: )
it 's the controller interface card i 'm talking about , rather than the drive , the bit that has
hm , there was discussion about providing a native hook for this from snappy itself
i mean that i would differeciate between `` a layman can break it with a laptop in hours '' and
as in , it stopped working ?
better ? : )
ok ... .
still i am not seeing mouse pointer..
does that change it being wise to apply to an ubuntu installation ?
what was the name of the .desktop entry ( not the file.desktop )
and that 's different from installed : ?
and you are adding this to a clean install of ubuntu , right ?
?
some ops say ppas are not supported here , others say we support what users are prepared to give advice
use paste.ubuntu.com to share multiline here
did it go weird after an update perhaps ?
ugh , that -really- sucks ...
yes , assuming that the entries in the file are in some kind of consistent format . also , how
yeah , well that 's buggy
i got it fixed : )
can you try the update-alternatives command ? it should allow you to set the symlink . if that does n't
permissions
: ) yep let alone my mozilla work is based around linux
yes , i have done that
ok , then i 'm glad i have you .
the menu became a direct reflection on the workflow idea
have you decided the final look of the desktop ?
okay
does ps list it ?
please pastebin the output of `` cat /etc/apt/sources.list ''
let me know if can help
yes
welcome to webapps : )
ask the developers
we used to use the changes file for that
or renamed it to .deb and use mc to browse it
hit ctrl+alt+f1 , then log in as your user and show me a fresh `` ls -al ~/ | pastebinit
15.04 is still very new tho
do you arrange your tests in lexicographic order ?
i guess you 're trying to verify a wily silo on a vivid phone image and having problems ? that
but that 's a debug message ; still running with `` debug '' ?
kick it : )
i do that in muon > configure software sources > other software ?
have you tried just hitting 'k ' ?
i 'll make better screenshots for the release announcement
i *made* the fail train page ... what are you seeing now ?
can you refresh my memory on what 's expected to happen here ? should p-m calculate installability assuming the nbs
with *three* calls to startsync it reliably passes , remove any one and it seems to fail
right
a header action from the now playing page ?
no worries mate !
in the end , lp should not be a blocker ( words out of beuno 's mouth ; - )
that is my suggestion for you
not good
it 's not necessarily about the coc , which i totally agree with . it 's the greater `` meaning
right now it looks like we have a couple of options :
right , so there was no media in it before ?
which seems weirdly frequent for a rare race we 've never noticed before .
would you like to run an anonymous imageboard ?
great , afterwards , please power down the ubuntu machine by holding the power button down until the machine turns
i 've done that a few times now already
things like `` module `` qtcontacts '' is not installed '' maybe help if they are resolved
eh , today the worker is n't killed when the returned error is an errtryagain
why , you always hit that bug before ?
thk 's for replay it is mint
good evening
eof ?
qo
webops confirmed that the change was not done , i 've filed a new rt to get it done and
you have an idea ?
does juju-deployer cache configs anywhere on the os ?
do you have a question about a particular one ?
yeah just above ... look up
ok , press ctrl+x
are you in the live session right now ?
ah ok .
i. e. analyze plot is always available and has no overhead ; bootchart is on request and has the usual
can you put that outputs in a pastebin ? lsb_release -d , uname -a , cat /etc/apt/sources.list , cat /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
for now wily only . i will leave it up to mvo to decide if it needs to be backported
14.10 ? which package ?
maybe
it had an option for win ( uefi ) or other
picture time
why not ?
excellent . do we know if it 's 100 % working , i.e . , the issue ennoble is seeing
zippi : cheers
definately a bit dirty , but sure , why not
/mnt/boot/efi does n't exist
the cname record points from yourdomain.net to your_dyndns_domain.net where you have an a record pointing to your current ip address
yeah , we 're loading the spl and uboot that is already flashed in the emmc
how do i do that >
try again , sorry
the solution is what i had and does n't work for me
is it possible to adjust the left margin of the checkbox shown in multiselect mode ? it is missing 1
oh - no wifi , but fixable for a couple of quid
ohhh kk
well , as we 're now using subnettag i ca n't construct a subnettag for an invalid cidr
i can give you the download link for the sdk if you are interested ...
can you please run `` glxinfo | grep opengl '' and paste the output in the bug ? the key
ah , ok
no corrections i do n't think . it says finished . 18 % non-contiguos on vda1 and 0.1 % non-contiguous
we should invite him but then he 'd have more work to do : )
completely ignoring that nearly everyone runs something like ubuntu or debian or rhel or sles and uses packages with backported
done
do we have to manually add ourselves to channel list ?
what 's your launchpad username ?
can you check through bug 1449744. openstack-trove/designate were skipped
or the tox docs , its not a tool i use
what 's your other small issue ?
sure that 's fine , and understandable on both accounts .
still working here
i do n't
i only do n't know about `` update-rc thingy ''
i 've seen it happen - mainly with lenovo uefi too !
it seems related to having my external monitor connected
probably just too old and rubbish to play netflix then .
when you tried that entry did anything happen ? usually a faulty entry just means grub returns to the boot
ok , i 'll look at that , thnks
ok , try rebooting
oh , to great westerford ? no
ok
so basically if i 'm a developer i will not ever use snap packages myself ?
ah . i 'm not using vanilla intellij , i 'm using pycharm . it 's pretty stable
ok , i wanted to know to choose an appropriate swap size .
utlemming may know , but he is us timezone so the answer might be delayed
the paste was just to confirm what you just answered
the default driver is nouveau right ?
tasdomas : a more accurate nname would be ourobourosmanifold but that 's , er , a bit obscure
if i run it now , it works
if the bios is `` secureboot '' then the problem is the lack of a signature , not the fs
oooh will that also fix the case when removing six kernels that the grub config is updated six times ?
install the nvidia drivers
it finished
i 'm good right now
well , i guess in two weeks there wo n't be anything ever going there
if you look with the whole error on the web you will know what i do , and probably what
get the name of your ubuntu installation , and your efi partition too
what language do you speak ?
i see , yeah that 'll have to be looked at ...
uploaded and accepted : )
ohh.. what 's clock look like on the dashboard anyway ?
no
step by step , if no one is taking ownershio and is a pita for us , lets do it
me too
knock off the nonsense
i have no idea . i do n't even use ubuntu : d
development pourposes ?
it 's a change in code , but this basically should n't require a re-test i suppose ...
neither `` uname -a '' nor `` free -m '' share information from log files .
telegram
with autoconnect=true ? we rely on that piece of magic
a quasi-standard bootloader is no replacement for a proper boot specification and a proper firmware interface . luckily we are
yes . add configurations in $ home/.ssh/config . see `` man ssh_config ''
those are on separate servers xd
so basically if an issue requires canonical sysadmins or mirrors admins to act on it , put it on rt
never a happy experience : d
dankie
as i said , trusty
wo n't grub find his other os and kernel ?
your system is really broke mate , install 14.04.3 clean
well , that 's why i wrote this earlier : < dimitern > themue , try : ssh -i ~/.juju/ssh/id_rsa
well we needed to check whether you got sold a machine with a lemon of a hard disk , otherwise
i recommend upgrading though , as you are on lts
the vhost doesnt bind
superfly wrote something the other day
if you ca n't install one package via tickbox as most folk can , then the issue lies with you
i was told it was to do with i ran a script in sudo that should not have been so
well , i doubt you have cloud-init installed ?
ok , have a good night
no , it does n't need it . as far as i can think you 're now done , and
yeah , especially if it 's just an ssh away : )
it seems to be contradictory
you might find it more sensible to torrent kubuntu
annotation impl treats env differntly than other entities for historical reasons
things tend to work until they stop , regardless of how long
can you show me the code ?
if your dropping to an initramfs then that means your having a network issue connecting to the iscsi targer
oh hey ! - saw some strange issue earlier today where pod object was n't defined but we have been
right , good spot . ( s/amazonaws/amazonaws-cn ) .
that may already be reported - there has been extensive discussion about the battery monitor
this is support only not chit chat
i can see you 're correct : ) lol . maybe i 'll run their beta .
pushed
that suggests you did n't completely upgrade to the lts enablement stack
as said , we do n't have any hint from design on how shoudl we show the focus
i 'm guessing that direct rendering is broken everywhere , not just for steam
nvm , i 'll write stuff on the mr
i know , but i am just feeling guilty for not putting more effort into it . its just that
what do you contribute btw ?
the current plan is to add scrollview which will provide the scrollbars , and you just add the flickable as
please
like a game with extra levels
yes please ask this on # ubuntu-server
and i believe it 's in > = 1.22
i. e. they trick ifupdown to think that it already brought up ethn , so /etc/network/if-up.d/000resolvconf would never run
buy it , download , install
right , but that 'd be sufficient
either 2 or drop it and let ddebs take over it
so he can be a good point of contact
there seems to be something wrong with the preview.iscurrent flag . it 's always being set on preview0

i set it to 0.0.0.0
confirming which package broke what should get a lot easier and more predictable with the -proposed minimalization too
yw : - )
well that would work too
am i unlucky in being affected by the crash bug ? or would another qe maybe miss it ?
no , right now we just follow what you all were doing to build
it will open

you probably want the guys in # juju-dev for that one
it is

no

right , hence the `` ooops '' ...
yes . i was n't aware this is public api , at least in glib/gtk land i only know it
when is a `` proper timing '' ?
easiest way to prove if it 's ubuntu at fault , disconnect the disk with ubuntu on .
hang on
do you see grub ?
please check
then in /etc/default/grub add grub_enable_cryptodisk=y
are you referring to my issue ?
how you installing the apps ?
we , it 's a feature to land it , it 's not a feature to tweak more i.e the

sorry for asking ... . if your printer is working , what are you looking for ?
no , you will get a menu to install ssh/lamp and such , called tasksel

certainly , it 's an isolation problem . i wonder if there are n't a lot more similar problems in
the 'whois ' command seems to timeout ...
never saw that before , from which branch are you running it ?
o , that interests me
oh , do n't do that !
hrm : /
ah , it is eol in july , my bad./
then infinity , i guess
if it 's newer than 2010 then it most likely uses uefi instead of bios
i had to setup them manually after install
yup
the new version just built , though , so maybe it 'll be happy .
you ?

that 's beuno plan

many years of problems with external usb drives . power is always the problem

its actually a file descriptor , my bad
most of my sites are in /var/www , others are aliases . no need for symlinks .

it probably does n't work with the version in the ppa but it does work with trunk
not yet . i 'll give it go though . does the syslog paste show what went wrong ?
is it normal it has 0 used ?
that all was locked down by the higher security standards on the phone these days
and of course if it wrote something sensible into /etc/network/interfaces
probably ~/.cache/mozilla or ~/mozilla
you can call remove-package against a ppa .

that 's probably best

yes it works . i reflashed this morning after not having success yesterday and it did n't seem to change
that 's certainly not the failure i would expect
what went wrong ? the package should have already been uploaded
dont use geany with sudo
fairly logical assumption .
very good , if the hardware would run that

most recent commit of elementary-xfce
trying to put one on a vps is a mistake
any crash report that is non recoverable

that 's because it 's `` pending '' , not yet `` published ''
the first was [ \ ! a-ma-m ] * and the second was [ ! \ ! a-ma-m ] *
have you tried setting term to something different ? i 'm just guessing here
both are installed already
that 's what i read from the spec
are you getting a permission denied error typing 'ls /usr/bin/sublime '
that 's what i 'm trying to do . package virtualbox-5.0 is n't installed , as it says , but
why are you trying to hide software from the system ? ca n't you just uninstall it ?
not an ubuntu issue , xchat issue
than your emulator console will be full of upstart events .

there 's not much there yet , but i suppose one could yes , technically
because i 'm proposing it instead . i thought you had no time .
we all are in a meeting , will come back to you once that 's over
that worked man
alright . hi , so , you 're here and interested in being unbanned from -ot , correct ? (
restared several times now
: )
i already did fk myself , i beat my meat 3 times a day
svij what version of android-tools-adb do you have , which version ubuntu
from the link you provided .
win 8.1 , universal-usb-installer-1.9.6.2
sure thing
would it be possible for you to tell me the exact setting or setting screen then so i can google
windows
pah !
that all needs to be defined in hardware support packs that just drop the right bits in place , and
meanwhile you can play on nouveau : p
it 's odd i have that file
ok trying the rebuild now .
ok . so if kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa is n't a good place to get kernels , what is the recommended place ?
cool.. that *could* add the support.. thats the 3rd party source i referenced earlier

yeah , ask away , if nobody answers try askubuntu.com
a sticky situation : i 'm reviewing now ( packaging wise ) silo 9 which has pulseaudio 1:6.0-0ubuntu9.11
is 3d accelleration enabled in the vm settings ?
done : can you nominate bug 1430694 for utopic and trusty ( vivid is already ok ) ?
how can i find out which version im using , i just used whatever was in the repo
completely legit
nope get it from the download.kde.org url i gave you
yes we do , except some patches from knoppix for accessibility purpose
i would have to use plop linux though .
if that 's what you 're looking for
just trying to help the steps installing here , you might have overlooked something maybe
they do n't just keep the changes for themselves ?
oh it 's you anyway ( checks scrollback )
is /system/media/audio/ui/camera_click.ogg missing on your phone ?
yeah
i saw you guys broke into some other stuff in the scrollback
did you select it in the bios ?
should be able to do it in the networking menu
did n't manage to catch it yet that way
you can just tell laney your images are ready and he can mark them .
sgdisk is needed in for cloud-init to resize the disk
i would do a full reinstall with all hd 's inside
ok , a binding then
enlighten me
sounds like the closest , yes . still a bit strange , i remember i tested and approved that branch
the report suggests the printer had insufficient ram to support the postscript files being sent to it

dafty ... the cable in your web link pic looks nothing like mine . i was testing . i have
it was never meant for you man
actually that looks like a snappy problem huh
i tested it with trunk , i can rerun it with the other mp
`` systemctl start networkmanager.service '' will likely be required too , at least in my experience
ack , that is exactly the case . marking appropriately in the spreadsheet then .
stop it immediately
palm was even more heavy handed with taking their cut than apple and google today .
in any case , i ran upgrade too and there 's no difference
sounds nice
you running a amd card catlyst can do it
no - the oslo packages wo n't be in debian anytime soon
and we 'll have failing tests
ya , that 's my next step .
actually , the getauthfunc defined there is just what you need
yes , for sure
the flash memory stick has a gpt partition table with 2 primary partitions .
my main 14.10 is backed up atm . almost 2tb of data . what i 'm on right now is
to inodes . df -i will tell you
if you know what i mean
pfff
but yes , this is the place you are looking for
but still , seems if i do not cache the alarms , then i do n't get crashes ... though
currently i am only removing lib/modules and lib/firmware from the initrd i extracted from the preinstalled tarball
so , there 's clearly a second step here that involves changelogs.u.c
i have a 14.04 chroot here i 'm working from
configure the dns server via resolv.conf/nameserver then ?
our uni uses google email , surely that is not the problem
what about panel-switch` ?
and in the end it will not make it faster : )
ok done , sda2 is already mount on /mnt
no you dont .
sounds mean
how do i upgrade using the ubuntu desktop iso installer ? there is no cdromupgrade file in it .
if i hover over a proper link , right-click ... i get a menu , i choose open link .
most likely .
phpmyadmin is a web app , nothing to do with physical machine login
i agree with your motivations , and i do some extreme encryption stuff myself , so do n't think i
security_template_valid ( meta/system-compositor.apparmor )
i mean between dash and scope
rightclick , selecect properties . combine the location and name information
when i ran the whole suite , i got tons of errors . i thought it was my device or
weird , is it the status stuff not in there ?
in here , or the list or somewhere
danke .
you 're going to make me read
hahahahahahahaha
no bot tests in here .
lxc-android-config is good old dput ? no train ?
oh - we had a bug about that the other day
i 'm looking into it right now
do you have something specific in mind ?
there is the unity-tweak-tool in the repo
this is the xps default install so i assume that dell may of tinkered with it , let me reinstall
but that is n't updated past 13.10
man limits.conf
i have no idea about windows or its service packs . but i guess it 's a positive contribution and
for once all the nfs/rpc daemons are in /usr/sbin : )
mariadb vs mysql
theres much you can do : test hd , test memory , update bios , open up your pc and
also what gave it away that it was ansible ?
no sorry , only the home one is
meh . it 's the installer . it makes room for more things to be installed from a cd
i 'm running it on my crappy computer . core 2 duo , gt 730 , 3.5gb ram
what is your trello username ?
i wont spy
i thought the bot could handle feature branches
now back to my orignal question . if someone wants to reach my 'owncloud ' service and a different person
absolutly
now let 's try it and see what we get : `` grub-install /dev/sdb ''
yes it should , that 's quite strange

you know wich plugin webbrowser-app uses ?
so then you could manage your snappy system , but it 'd actually be using rest .

it has a patch to enable userns mounts , but apw is the author
does less work ?
i see - he looks like a nice guy
tried it . grub menu is still 800x600 ( 800x600 ) , bootup is in 720x400 ( 720x400 ) and

just wanted to give you a head 's up regarding some changes we intend to make to the juju/charm repo
most of the time : )
well we kinda ... do n't have a life
yes
i 've tweaked the bug tasks
i know , check above
i do n't understand
we 'll land soon
yes
well as i said , wifi should not disconnect on a flash playing
what dbarth said is n't quite enough
desrt
the lines with # are comments to help understand the file later
not asap .
my understanding was that testing was split out before core was cleaned up
ah , just joined channel .
greatness
but other news articles say different
thats a general recommendation to everyone , including people using ubuntu

this is not really fixable unless we touch every plugin
do you have the libz.so . with the numbers after it
what page ?
stop it : d
what 's nice about it

if they wanted people to be able to run whatever live distro they probably would n't have restricted the bios

3.10 was never a official ubuntu kernel . so you manually did stuff there .
*lol* cool , np , it 's a good feeling to get the first fix in
vbox 4.3.26_98988
it 's all greek
the rest of the fields look good
hi
you cant run ntfs as system partition on linux . but you can use it as a data partition ,
sorry , forgot to respond here . i ran it on the device under click , but i ca n't
where are we meeting ?
can you publish a citrain package in the tools ppa ?
what i 'm doing now , is to change how setup is invoked
? i meant no do not check upstream since it 's long obsolete : )

i used your 1.9 snap
instead using the widget container
hehe , larsu should send one back from his niece !
did you get back home all right ?
yep
can we purge the steam application from the command line ... ? i installed it from the ubuntu software center
right , but currently the broken system has an nvidia-generated xorg.conf ... which may be all that needs tweaking to
do you remember the problem i talked to you about ? i 'm not able to debug it , so
i did n't upload it yet ( sorry , being over-pinged )
oh , i see ; well , you never need any of the b-d to build a source
description updated , feel free to rephrase
lets move this to # -release
if you have a part that generates this bug please put it in the bug and i 'll fix

could you point me in the direction of configuring that ?
which ppa ?
i 'm preaty sure i got it of one of the ubuntu websites

have you read the link posted by lotuspsychje
i tried building one part out of few
only up my kilt
but just fyi'ing on the picture there as it was thought about for sure
do you have a nice bundle to deploy this ?
actually what is that system ? branded or a custom build ?
\o/
good deal : d
manual .deb 's are a bad idea , since they wo n't get updated
right , so it is what i 'm talking about then .
we can move it up yes , is that want we/you want ?
from ?
oh - wait not any more
i will try snappcraft first and see how it goes and then submit one next week
tcpdump
one moment then .
it worked
the recent rhythmbox upload is another example

how can i check if i can change output ?

that helps , but not what i was looking for . when i select window , it should come to
that 's better luck than me . lost a few meg last time ( on a 900gb disk )
only consideration would be , let the system shutdown properly on its own processing , as opposed to have a

yay for ubuntu deltas : (
that 's the point , you ca n't do that in any automated way if you have an sd card
already done . lets focus on ubuntu support again
if it loops , it wont alarm neither
using wine ?
yeah , seems to be a race indeed
what were you doing with x.org
you just blew my mind .
probably well ... puppy is well known for low specs and working well on a variety of machines .
cool . sometimes when udm gets confuzzled , it confuzzles the whole stack upwards : /

what is the loggo data race ?
ok , try grep bootmgfw.efi.backup /usr/lib/os-probes/mounted/efi/20microsoft

ok : )
/var/libs/juju/db is using 3.7gb
the phone is currently vivid based
is the factory reset important , or can it happen after a normal flash ?
it 's a pretty basic one .
oo this is looking better : - )
yeah haha
that also explains akonadi

probably make the official control have > = 1.1 but then when wily generates it it can change to 1.2

so one theory might be that the delta update used the wrong base , e.g . `` other '' was
you may have seen , 1.24 and master now have no storage ff and also have upgrade step for block
i 've seen the change ...
derp sorry , sil2100 can i push that button too
okay , will do that first then : - )
again : chrome is eating up your memory .
i obviously failed badly at geography
due to the removal of space.validate and changes to addspace

better ask a specific question
that is the task of canonical
that when i force my way into busybox and mdadm -- add the second partitoin , and then reboot ,
kilos- , kilos-
yes
okay
says on dovecot
again : ubuntu support only here . not hardware .
it 's probably selected , that makes it the default
probably something to do with systemd , i 'd imagine , but have n't really researched it
it happens sometimes that the aggregating home lens is blocked by some child , should resolve itself after a few
nope
# # programming might be a good start maybe ?
we need another point release/pre built image
are you on windows ?
there are so many combinations of series , substrate , juju version etc
if the new snappy binary helps or not
from your presentation 's perspective , i 'd say it would be good to sugegst such a thing !
i did make clean ; go test -compiler gccgo -test.timeout=1200s github.com/juju/juju/ ...
i do n't think there are any apps that register as sources for links
i would expect both of those to match , but i have n't specifically tried debsums on my system recently

and you think another linux distro is using another kernel ?
i would try to write script who formats chart element . behavior : user creates in calc a chart .

it autoredirects me there
that too , though i 've seen it with a present driver that locks up during normal boot but will
i know but it says to back up the open source one
i dont know why you choose lilo in first place . grub is the ubuntu standard . and that is
how do i run tests in there ?
i saw but could n't quite get it
yes ?
never be afraid
if i restart computer how can i make sure the screen gets saved

also there could be a problem with other hardware , but ram and hard drive are the ones that can

normal .

what is next ?
wonderful to hear . getting away is nice . i hope you are feeling quite refreshed
aisrael : fresh imaged computer , did the ruby install of brew , xcode cli tools , brew install juju-quickstart
or do we plan to switch -proposed to vivid before it 's rolled as a stable ota to users ?
cool , keep us posted
you think the bt headphones send the p key to the pc ?
if a popup does n't appear , that 's a bug , so the click-test found one . yay .
as i have said before , we are looking at a facilitative oligarchy
so did your patched binary help ?
perrito666 has approved the 1.25 pr so i 'll crack on with that

best thing if unsure is open a terminal and run `` sync ''

wow that 's new
but i need a break , back in ~ 1 h

you still have to mount the virtual cdrom device manually .
it depends on how you have set up the system . examine your configuration file to identify where it expects

cool
even better

it was preinstalled by windows 8.1 and it was faster

what did you mean when you say im strolling ? ..
they do n't have a # in front of them ?
lol , the answer to your question was right there
its an partitioning style
mint is not ubuntu . mint is not supported here . at all .
yes , say it failed
you guys should really get paid for this , i 'm trying to learn how to utilize linux/ubuntu and i

looking again at your revised patch
well if i launch `` ubuntu '' it wo n't load actually , i 'll just end up having a
yes please
type sudo usermod -ag sudo , adm , cdrom , plugdev nectar
i thought it was more general though , random libraries wanting to do things on read only locations
not obviously . perhaps bootstrap respects environment variables and create-environment does not , for example .
iirc you ca n't access any of the localstorage stuff from a worker script , so you basically have to
no rush , just wanted to add the note above
in runtests.sh , you can see how we do it for 'normal ' : plainbox run -t 2015.com.canonical.snapcraft : :

the build-dependencies of sssd exist but are not in main
i would like to know the command to get rid of unity , it is a pita
ux-wise just conditioning users to press the big red retry button is less good than just doing it ourselves
if you are trying to use sudo to use apt though , i 'd not recommend it . you should

have you replaced the symlink /etc/resolv.conf with a file , in which case you wo n't see the change .
we wrote our own xgettext
ok .
etherape is also nice to see network traffic , gui
it will inform you about the reboot and give you a chance to cancel it
it means its too damaged
well yea , i meant the actual username of your admin user
nope not you : - )
that 's all personal preference ... anything can be customized , but it 's a matter of how much time
hmm wait
yes ; )
k ; yeah i do n't need curdir/pwd
no worries
you had said you would look at it
yeah , that works for me
you just click on the drive in nautilus
yup , i remember the same , but it 's not working
there are also post-commit webhooks on github . they can post to a public url , whenever new commits get
i do n't think i can do it ...
worth filing a bug i guess : ) so the implementers know about that

awesome news !
i 've had times i needed to mess with plymouth 's configuration or reinstall for it to work properly
i suggest you to backup and replace
ok , any chance i get wpa out of that silo or do you have to run the assign-job again
that said , in my personal opinion , if `` apt-get dist-upgrade '' does n't get it mostly right ,
so why dont you install ubuntu normaly ?
added other ppa 's of any kind before skype install ?
confirmed your 32-on-32 works , 32-on-64 does n't findings .
even if i am in the .ssh dir ?

i 'm just saying your logic is wack
lets first troubleshoot this issue before doing random things .
oki , ping me then : )
yw !
hey , yes ! how is your fosdemflu , feeling better ?
where did you note it ?
i needed a different question
basically , even if it was from the default repository , the xubuntu team might not `` support '' it
ya , probably they 're just a bit busy right now
was to expect for anything which built before systemd migrates to the release pocket
right , but we have no way of knowing that
distros do n't have a distinct partition , they just share the same zfs pool ( on dmcrypt )
`` ls -l /etc/reoslv.conf '' should show that is a symlink `` /etc/resolv.conf - > ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf ''
no i dont have a faulty hard drive , prove i can install other oss
aw , shucks
sorry but you should seek your own distros support

i 'll check it out
at a conference , so not really a holiday : - )
well , a few years ago this led to a week of frustrating debugging because the device used in ci

ok sounds good
debian/control : : description : 'a screenshot commandline screenshot program . ''
which is why there is ui dedicated to 'disabled in hardware ' in gnome now
i inserted cd but nothing shows up in files manager
ask every 15 minsor so
1 ) the juju/helptopics stuff . that documentation is available through the command line right ?
and without grub the system will not boot ...
after about 10 seconds
it looks like you pulled yours from openstack-charm-testing right ?
ack , we can then check which quirks pm-utils actually applies , etc .
can you comment on the bug with steps you used to reproduce
can you ?
to much junk / clutter on them ...
in debian/ubuntu we disable the predictable interface names ( similar , but not identical to biosdevname ) by default ;
no
heh , i guess it needs some polish first , but thats the direction
not at all ; lots of regressions too
the autopilot tutorial explains how to define and use custom proxy objects . and the toolkit api docs show the
ye , not a bad price to pay
awesome . had a lovely time on our farm with family and friends . classic poirot and candy . :
i did those 2 commands
or well , we could try to create a component with 5.5 import
can you contact a podcast feed at all ? id web site slow/stopped for you ?
not install yet , still downloading ... almost done
adobe does that
you helped us : )
dropbox share or just an email i guess to nik90 @ ubuntu.com
at startup i see an error `` error parsing pcc subspaces from pcct ''
wait
have the charm write it to the init script ?
yes googling us.archive.ubunto.com yields really old articles .
what do i do ? disable the nvidia side , since i want the battery life..
how old is the machine ?
the partition i have is the users area from a mac , which is usually encrypted . i have taken
bah , i thought i 'd caught all those packages apart from sidnei 's .
okay.. can i put that file on my usb ubuntu install key ?
oh . but do n't i need the windows licence number ? it 's not written on the back of
yes , it 's connect with cable
and the ubuntu usb creator
how should one depend on a binary that 's shipped in those packages then ? i do n't want stuff
how would i know ? : )
qml vs. c++ testcase
i have the same video gpu ... why nouveau ?
slickymaster i 'll go and whine in # ubuntu-fr that xubuntu needs more translators , and they can come talk
qt will cache the image , it wo n't make multiple copies per scope
windows knows smb : // ?
might be worth checking the current /boot/grub/grub.cfg again , and if it still has a custom `` set linux_gfx_mode= ...
so now what ?
it might be easier to just encrypt the home folders of all users . that way the can not see
mac uses mdns if i recall
but if you also used my instruction for manually clearing demoedgescompleted , you 'll end up with an empty string
but could also be something else , i just set it back to 1024 and get the same error ,
yeah ... it 's a bug in ci train ( lp : # 1417961 )
dealing with the udm stuff to get it landed today too
by their life cycle value i guess
then i wo n't be helping you . sorry .
i mean basic dialog box which appears on ubuntu
ah , good deal . yeah perhaps making that regex a little less specific would be good , then
yeah , and use its boot menu to choose which .efi file you wan na load
i doubt it , i dont even get it to power on at all
i do n't check the forums that much anymore . honestly , i 've recently gotten back into helping people
here it is , i run a mixed servers setup where all the non-root users are the same and for
it 's targetting lp : ubuntu/ubuntu-ui-toolkit , should target lp : ubuntu-ui-toolkit i suppose
should appear in ~15min
elopio : fgimenez : sergiusens : ogra_ : so it seems we 're good to go , right ?
sorry , -- auto-deconfigure
no , i mean are the errors it spits out now readable and complains only about things that are really
this was because i had ( or have ) a problem with an usb flash drive
ack , let me see if the rerun works
yess sir
so the crasher was introduced after 1.2.1450+15.04.20150318-0ubuntu1 and fixed in today 's 1.2.1458+15.04.20150327-0ubuntu1 release
[ [ : lower : ] ] { 3 } even
i 'm installing 14.10 so i do n't have to make any changes on ssd ?
ok : d sleep well
not at all intruding , and yes , you are in the right place
you have n't asked a single silly question thus far !
sweet !
network and ethernet do n't show kernel
yeah , maybe a warning or something in the documentation should be written if the bug is n't fixable ?
the sdk tools discussion will go around moving away from the distro releasing to the qtsdk modell . that is
good night
nope .
it 's a bit suboptimal though , it means common action are not easily available
yeh , i prefer humans for paying in , but a receipt with a scan seems reasoanble
so i should run canonical_device $ device to see if it works ? i dont see where $ device comes
ok , no ubuntu entry , so i do n't think grub is done yet
what version of ubuntu are you using ?
new ones should be 1
lol
but then , the markdown for developer.u.c needs to be django flavour , unless we change that
linux is case-sensitive in many cases . but not in xorg.conf .
depends on how your global accel is setup : d
ok , so let 's remove the device mapper entry and re-run the init script . `` sudo dmsetup remove
popey : how 's life ?
yes . it should n't be difficult .
you 'd probably have better luck asking on # openssh ( chances are more folks actually doing that in that
indeed : )
happy2help !
games can be demanding . is the performance in 15.04 worse than in previous releases ? or do you have
yeah downtime has costs , so it 's better to use lts ?
a new one ?
not even looked at it . i just know printf still does n't work
excellent , that confirms my suspicion that they broke bzr on pypi very recently
so hopefully it 's already in there
ok - so remove it from the server
nothing changed ... same way as always
yeap , with the i7
yes it is sideloaded
if nothing else you could add `` -odebug : : pkgproblemresolver=true '' to the appropriate apt-get invocation which should get
maybe - i was just surprised by the diff between virtualized ppa and distro builders
i have nvidia 820m graphics card and using nouveau driver
design/mpt clearly stated it 's a bug on the mp
any idea ?
i 'm on 14.10
of the build and apn page
need moar rams : (
if you 're sure it 's empty go to the installer
yes .
ups , srry , i overlooked the all-snaps bit : /
which xubuntu version are you using ?
use `` msdos '' .
the hostname also matters for verifying the the identity of the remot ehost , but
well what ?
alt-f10 should
maybe we should just generate something like `` service for { pkgname } - { servicename } '' or something
dig +noall +answer www.defcon.org
great
from gui i got this error : `` error occurred while deploying the bundle : ( 'no charm metadata @
thats not it , must be the card name + model and driver loaded
i dont understand your question , but , `` root '' or sudo will be able to access it still
you let kde mount it ?
do you have a link with documentation ? i 'm struggling 'cause i went the winbind route and i 'm
what does the package manager report ? `` dpkg -s pl2303.ko ''
of course there is . usually done via trusts and llps via london as we have lax financial regulations .
restarted and still no different
sounds like screen magnifier
ah 192.168.1.75 , looks like it 's getting an ip on your network fine . if that 's your home
yuck
also , if i 'm running a server , it seems the easiest approach may be to just get a
try it , and let me know what you want me to do .
i had a similar issue this morning i went into /etc/bluetooth/main.conf and set rememberpowerd to false . also you may
yes : )
`` is there anything else you wish to share with us about freegeek chicago or how you use xubuntu ?
hope you get better as well !
those commands*
ok well please stop hassling us about it , the answer is n't going to change
surely it 's not a confinement/apparmor issue ?
yeah . any suggestion on how to make a liveusb that : 1 ) has persistence 2 ) has a
go ahead , disable it .
k ;
great , i 'll stick to this , i do n't like free form : - )
?
ah i see . i heard of people going from 14.04 to 14.10 in the past though .
\o/
how about loading a previous kernel from grub ?
we have # lubuntu-devel and the mailing list associated with the qa team where most of the technical discussion happens
since i got an osd on gmail on the latest -proposed
i just gave it to you , so yes
not tomorrow , but qmlproject is not really good
i simply use unetbootin , though , the iso 's can simply be dd copied over to a usb stick
is there a way to check it ?
or move the check out of the setup
yeah thats why i asked
i 'm somewhat spread thin right now , perhaps in 45 mi nutes when my lunch is
`` sudo service maas-regiond restart ''
you have to register your account , see /msg nickserv help register
oh , because that 's the existing check , right
i can pastebin the results
that doesnt show up anymore
ah , heh
i am using it with lubuntu chating with you
i suppose i will find out from the blood tests if it was hereditary
is it possible to remove lvm without a complete reinstallation ?
no
major_version needs to stay at 4.10
the search issue - that was cloud storage not being searched
well a reinstall should fix it
so you mean that unity8 did sent all the mir-surface-resize events but the client just did n't process them all
but i marked it as watch ?
what about buildroot ?
ok - type `` top '' in a shell , press the number one and take a screen shot of
so i 'll let gcc-4.9 finish building for vivid ; if that succeeds , i 'll upload gcc for precise
likely because the machine was old and slow
ca n't upload to the silos
sorry to hear that ! i 'd recommend mailing the juju mailing list ( juju @ lists.ubuntu.com ) if you
how ?
yes
so what happens ? cloud-init service gets killed , and not started on post-upgrade ... remaining cloud-init services do n't
the way we 've built it , the android layer is separate from the ubuntu layer
so link to the kde bug site
tests added ( should have been there from the start , i know ) and i 'm going to go
system-image.ubuntu.com is technically not intarwebs , it 's on the canonical network . so by /policy/ it should be allowed
sure , but where else can we log it ?
good shout ! ty
done .
otp
that 's the first installation ? it never works before ?
that means 14.04 users would have to run outdated versions of chromium , unless maintainers are so kind to backport
got international friends traveling ? dell m3800 is not sold in china , but i had co-worker who was visiting
use sudo
`` cordova build -- device '' is still the correct thing to do , right ?
says dkms : install completed
not yet , but poke ogra_ enough and maybe soon : )
you got a hardware wifi button on laptop ?
let 's not call it the same way as the networking method
basically , there is a possibility that the bad setting is still there , and that is what prevents the
marked on pad
desktop and correct
not it is n't
or drink a beer for me
and not here but on a pastebin
than make one you do agree on , but do n't let someone claim ubuntu is not free software
empty
nice , hope its that . here is what i see when its broken :
have you gone into `` desktop effects '' and tried changing from automatic to something else ?
it 's a freedesktop thingie
no worries , sorry it did n't get fixed the first time
and then what ?
what about /tmp/script.log ?
when orientedshell is in the built-in screen applicationarguments.devicename gon na be `` flo ''
where do you think i should start ?
yeah shout aswell
landed a precursor , now trying to get it going . the gcc5.0 transition complicates things
to me problems seems here
if you restarted lightdm , whatever session you had active is gone
they are all pretty much the same speed at adding , the encoding time wont be shorter or longer
did it just stop recording , or did it appear to crash ?
that 's correct , no idea how you ended up with what you got ...
i am on 15.04 ( unity desktop )
i 'm on what i believe to be the latest mako build for my channel , so i 'll open
yep replace and update-grub sorted it
tsdgeos if content hub will never use mime types , it 's pointless to do any remapping . would be
ensure you are using the credentials you specified for admin-password in your charmconf.yaml
1 . system settings > accounts > create google account .
aptitude is the package management system
that 's on flo
hey : ) i 'm glad someone is around - can i get an lgtm on this fix for the
so what version did you upload to vivid , and what was the previous version it replaced ?
yeah , we 've got lots done too : )
well yeah , afaik , there is none atm ...
tried but all i got are those conventional stuff
given it 's been over 6hrs and you 're still going , i have to wonder how you 're making
the release lists are almost a gig in size ?
yeah you could , but i mean it 's your data , there 's always a risk with partitioning and
were you given the option of selecting between multiple devices for the grub installation ? if so , which device
thats my ponytail !
there is already a card
: d
which ones ? back to reading the review
probably a failing disk or an interruption in power during a disk write , i would guess
ctrl + shift + m
telnet -b your.ip your.ip 1443
np
the rtm channel is the most tested channel
no
basically we add a script which is called during build , which goes to the archive , gets the debs
no , photorec is an app to try and recover lost files . short for photo recovery , but not
i read the code just now , it 's not doing snappy config
kernel version ?
they will change permissions on files/dirs recursively in a folder to those specified
/msg alis list *chr*bunt*
cat /proc/mdstat
sounds very very suspect .
heh , the `` fakes '' often come off the exact same production line
i mean maybe they 're local but moved to other countries ,
if you end up with just sdb plugged in and still ca n't boot , i would try that repiar
good
haha , nice : d
i hear we 're having a canadian sprint soon -- you can come back : )
i heard on one of the ubuntuonair sessions that it will happen . no eta though .
talk to the people who run your service
no , the pid of that dhclient did not change since 2 hours
i can relate to that . even if i could afford to go back it would be a difficult transition
i asssume you want me to see the boot in command line ( without graphics ) ...
yes , if you just install the rule , you need udevadm control -- reload
which drivers are you on ?
well , it 's not just devel if it 's a new feature
it 's not much ... but once we have 100 plugins it 's 100 times not much
83 % iowait at 20mb/s rewrite is not a good sign
that sounds good . it seems like there 's lots of places where mojo & juju could work better together
ss gives me unuseful data
it must be that you do that much extra devel on the devel branch and then only merge occaisionally into
ask mhall119 , he uses a nexus 4
sorry had to restart to test
and then you try to use hello-world.env and it ca n't create a tempdir because /tmp/snaps is owned by root
yep , all my attempts to reproduce were non-ha
there 's virtualbox and vmware
that seems to have worked thx : )
thinking more about it , curioux 's suggestion seems more appropriate
why nops , how do you know dropping that option doesnt perhaps disable other console options in the config ?
there might be a race here indeed
well , i 'm no ornithologist ...
ok , while phone unlocked , hold power key for maybe longer then normal , but before the pwr dialog
ack that here too - just checking ubuntu
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
see this guy , he 's even not attaching a debdiff !
you can use kxstudio , which , provides ppa 's to add to ubuntu , and sources to add to
could you please check if you have all the packages specified in debian/control ?
that 's the problem on me ...
realy you do n't know what fsf is ?
it works well for me
join the club .
it 's only an intermittent issue : - )
sudo service networking restart
ace , will invite you in a min
the affected version is -23 , and the working version is -22 ... kernel upgrade today initiated the problem
the efi files might be switched to boot grub , so the actual windows efi file is ubuntu
you 'll need root for most of this so to make things easier start off with `` sudo -i ''
no idea , # # windows will know
sudo apt-get install rng-tools
ah
put some of the extras on the external and use the internal , that is the standard way , you
loading ... never heard of pasteinit
while the bootstrap node does take an entire instance , you can put other things on it
the plugin was created by a team effort
which settings are you talking about ?
are you sure that the filesystem there is compatible with that command ? having no idea what macs use ,
did you restart the ssh service after edit ?
but be careful with things like that . you can try it if the black borders occur
but with lcy01 down again it 's going to take a fair while : /
help me help you
can you ping the internal ip of your router ?
what is your wifi card chipset ? ( see `` lspci '' )
basically , every tools i have tried says /dev/sda1 is mounted on / , except of df
insults will get you ... added to /ignore .
`` sudo mount -o remount , rw / '' and `` sudo add-apt-repository ppa : ci-train-ppa-service/landing-027 '' was not working
and sudo apt-get upgrade
so i can boot windows thats good , now im gon na try ubuntu , just 1 sec
setuid/setgid/sticky bit are set with the rarely-used fourth octet
no i do n't want . : ) i have just simple question .. maybe to discuss : ) ..
your next on the list : p
yes , but it is very fast and lean - so just run it - configure your queues and let
well , we 're hopefully going to be doing regular weekly chats about features we 're working on . though
yes , but i never tested that under unity
i usually click `` force rebuild '' and `` ignore missing twins '' by habit . i guess i do
indeed , the current implementation is hacky at best .
not on ota-6
if you find ag a bit buggy , i have a ppa with some custom patches which fix a few
?
it was working last night
ok cool , i finally had time to try out my own system image server and hat to use this
popey : but the reboot branch *is* the official one now ? is there any reason to preserve the one
the original one was from the train bot , but somebody got copy & paste happy there ; - )
im suggesting , the motherboard could be failing.. the usb ports.. simply the usb hardware/motherboard not supporting linux well..
but it is not a build dependency on all archs , is it ?
i did n't sync ...
currently using 14.10
you too .
i do , for provisioning and recovery
hopefully podbird will take over that need
i reset the root password . i logged into the `` console view '' , logged in , and changed
subnets in ec2 map 1:1 with azs , so you definitely *can't* run an instance with multiple nics attached to
not that i know of ; my goal was to remove windows and install ubuntu
ask a question then
i 'll land that this afternoon
in the livecd ?
how to echo file contents ?
also i am nit sure about what how to reconfigure : does editing the entry+saving does it ?
after the next 9months , you might experience the same issues over
afaict , all the screenshots and such just get deleted when adt-run finishes
e.g . `` 10.254.1.20 : /srv/cctv /mnt/cctv nfs _netdev 0 0 ''
do you remember what video card do you have ? i assume an integrated sis
nope , i 'll try
onboard
i was surprised that we still had qsettings code in there actually
so silo 16 must land first ?
yeah , i was about to say except in storageprovisioner watchmachine ( )
sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop logout and login to lubuntu
/j # php
i 'm worried about the worst case of what a confused state server might induce i guess
that is the desktop next iso with unity8 and mir preview/developer version .
i do n't care
wine is the way you do it
i just restarted my system and now ubuntu loged me in as the user 'gdm ' .
it `` fixes '' itself on reboot , yes
considering that gtk-launch is working in all ! unix stuff
sorry you do n't know what you 're talking about
rtm + the silo , so all the stuff for dash in there
because the owner of that launchpad ppa site deleted it
you mean canonical ? you can adress them on their webpage
ooh , that appears to have worked .
sudo apt-get purge pavucontrol
well ahead of you o
is the package manager in such a state that ' sudo apt install pastebinit ' fails ?
the stracktrace on the crash seems quite clean , nothing obvious that would cause a crash
ok , i 'll call it a day now . should be plenty to do tomorrow
ok , purge that one and download the one from that link .
i 'd probably just run it twice ; rsync source/ dest1 : destination/ ; rsync source/ dest2 : /destination/ ...
i cleaned the heatsink and it appears to be stable again
probably did , but meh
well , that 'd be the only consideration that i can think of , other than that , it should
cool : )
we had gnome by default on early ubuntu 's right
+1 to land
we should provided an optionionate default for our experience , with knobs for experts
or if you ran 'screen -s minecraft ' in the first place , instead of just 'screen ' , you
it 's not the only thing been holding it up
cron is the least of your troubles
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
i do -- i was stuck on clearwire 4g out in los banos for almost a year .
well i guess the bonus with juju charms is we could do a kolla like single process approach , or
i tried at least
mmm , i 'm installing also the headers
morning ! how was bcn ?
technical support for ubuntu linux
longpress a message to enter multiselect
are u a bot too ?
really ? so you got it alongside the other pc with a power extension , or are you using a
how was it
probably a useful template for reverts going forard
correct .
and are the /media/ mounts physical drives ?
ok
if we upoad it to the ppa it can land directly , or we do the full sru dance which
so you think its worth a shot to ship an empty uenv.txt and update might work ?
latency might kinda suck depending on circumstanceds and guest software acceleration . only fast thing i ever used was nx
ubottu has told you the network and channel
it 's not so much important just the bother of having to re-install : \
can you file a bug pls ?
i remember that kde announced 5.4.1 last week and it takes couple of days for kubuntu to ship it ,
oh , it 's a circular dependency
do you know which of sda1 and sda2 has the os installed in ?
it did n't work for me . i 'm still not getting the performance that i need
^
oh , you might be thinking that watching a silo will set the status to 'packages built ' . that
the answer it gave is the reason your change does n't cause infinite recursion
all i did was check the 'encrypt home dir ' box
how has `` the ci stack has broken down for uss '' ?
downloading
i say , try plank , and docky.. or an xfce panel setup like a dock , with the normal
check the id of the gpu and kernel driver with 'lspci -nnk ' , and then you can hopefully determine
squid-deb-proxy , i presume ? installing that into my vm
or that .
i said _check_ not _spam it into the channel_
what is your broadcom device ? have you read the broadcom page ?
looks like it 's working ... ty
we 'll go step by step and retrace what ubuntu-drivers does
hmm , so the binary module ?
i 'm guessing that the command was simplified
sweet !
up to you . 14.04 is still supported and will be for a long time yet
`` pastebinit < ( hexdump -c out.html ) ''
are you in the live session on the target system right now ?
pressing g takes you to the top of the man page , g takes you to the end
i 'll investigate that further
that keeps it updated , guess you could cron a cp
then you probably do n't need the newest software : )
is there any other log i can see ?
i do n't think it 's planned to land in the nexus 4 images in the normal channel at all
it is dark out
universe repo does not work for me
yep
did you delete everything in /boot ?
yeah
specifically , please try to run it in whatever configuration is slow for you .
ok - i 'll check when respun to confirm that
delete the entire build directory before calling cmake with -dcmake_build_type=coverage
done
saucy is eol , i 'd backup and fresh install
i have it , but how do i get the page elements like id , css class etc
makes total since , but sometimes , there are patches and fixes that do n't make sense upstream and it
hey .. you did ask .. it 's linux ... where there is a will there is a way .
is it only an issue with automated/preseeded testing , or does it fail to be useful when manually booted/driven too
it was hitting launchpad.net
do you know what device name it was using earlier
your means of getting gta goodness are n't hugely successful are they ? : )
i went up to the top of the channel but did not see your instructions sorry ould you up arrow
sigh . i dislike using alternate ports , more work for me to connect .
ok , i can spin up my own then .
that is a little faster , though
but why must i install/build manually ? it 's perfectly fine piece of software and should be in the repositories
dvd 's are a can of drm worms
it 's just that the keyboard wo n't display for any application that does n't have focus
that 's fine then
no , it survives
or is it '' high availability '' moment ?
just double checking ; )
at least it does the same thing
am i being stupid and missed something lol
oh , can it be done this way ?
euviuss create a hybrid mbr that contains that partition too , and it 'll work even on pcs whose bios
hold up on silo 23
ok , good to know : )
did you read the link i posted ?
resolution is fine now
though , maybe this is a self-solving problem if the ultimate goal is for migration to be unblocks , and

you get get ubuntu touch on your device now if you want
if you are using pulseaudio you should use the new volume manger which interfaces with pulseaudio .
coordinate that with ovidiu-florin

i have tipped wxl off , so as to concur that lubuntu will support a pi2 version of lubuntu .
it 's not a webdm afaik
another example of why a static foo triggers bar mapping would be nice : linux uploads should trigger ubuntu-drivers-common tests
and silo 23 which mterry published seems to be stuck on status : publishing
you had some patch cruft in debian/-p2 which was obviously an oops .
: ) no , sorry , was n't around enough during the day . i had hoped knome would do
not included then
it 's a little warmer than i 'd recommend but other than that , looks ok
hmmm , root-fs should be unlocked/mounted before /bin/bash is loaded .
what are you trying to access ? or why do you think you do n't have permissions ?
curious ...
no return to grub . once linux starts grub is toast
found an easy unity/compiz crash btw ; )
well it is a snapshot , so the values may be changing dynamically and so it is a fair approximation
nvm
i wish i was n't so lazy to invest in a real irc client so that i could block your
please join # ubuntu-ops if you wish to discuss your ban .
i see your changes that you demoed in brussels .
the awful artifacting has been there for some time now . the huge scaling inside the xmir window is pretty
its a change i dont know the magnitude of for sure
ok well you 'll need a new branch with a vivid changelog then
that 's coming from sound settings not from openshot
type sudo rsync -av /oldinstall/ /mnt ( make sure there 's a trailing `` / '' after oldinstall )
it 's not enough apparently lol
hopefully easier to follow : )
dput does n't parse it , it just turns into a directory on upload.ubuntu.com
upstream are pulling some new 1.23 features into a feature flag which should eliminate the regressions . but that means
yes . in vivd you will have kdeconnect installed by default
or try the liveusb and test from there
manual instaled ?
ok
upgrade time
when the deadline to apply fro the cc membership ?
you would store the lock data in the collection , but you could validate it against if the thing that
i top approved it
what about the ouput of a terminal command ?
do we have any of the coredevs active in this time ?
does your laptop have a switch ?
i suppose the fix _will_be_ vivid : )
also all the docs are in lp : autopilot proper , yes ?
inetpro grumpy ? never !
i seem to recall a bug about this or similarly named test - can you check if there is one
yup ...
seems to be by package name , then friendly name .
not really , i the quickstart issue was identifed and fixed in juju . a subsequent ci run failed ,
ok wait for some more experience person he can give us the better solution i guess
virtualbox.org
automute is not the issue . with the latest kernel the hdmi audio is n't even detected , ie does
you likely dont want any-buntu at all , and dont have to have it
ok
pull-lp-source $ package & & hack , hack , hack & & debuild -s & & debdiff old new .
yeah , should have instructions shortly
ok , type ls -ld /var/log
is it possible to ssh to it ?
aaaaand ... .
nothing out of the ordinary
check your logs
yes ! it 's error message !
that sounds like the way to go
when it 's safe to seed it again once the proper snappy firstboot logic is in place you can add
ah awesome : - )
i have a song in my head ... .it goes `` startreking across the universe , in the us enterprise
'pastebinit ' .
ya , that was my first thought , but the ld flags just pass on the gcc cli so it
thx man
32 or 63 bit ?
kinda ...
no idea ... i was kinda thinking a systemd integration issue , but james page has just reported the issue
hehe no
np , im off to bed now
why not dualboot , an external is never the same
had i not been sick we would be at the butterfly house with our daughter =/
my core is on an ancient ubuntu ... might be that it does not support the the same crypto lib
just unplugging a drive without umounting it first can do some bad things , but i would n't ever expect
just saw it . checking my change against voidspace 's change at the moment .
ok , where do i go from here ?
from terminal
docker users treat containers as black box blobs they do n't tend to have to care about . and snappy
okay , the commit to branch from there is : c07aef9cb4f2ff1db7ddc9d43a0ea88eca39c9ea
type grep -m1 vmlinuz /boot/grub/grub.cfg
ok .
it even has linux , setting osi of which fixed the bug
k lets back up . ignore the www-data . the path /var/www/files all needs to be owned by root :
when i delete the file reappears .
i do n't see any epson scanner drivers in the archives , maybe epson publish their own
did you power off not a restart . after starting did refind boot manger show .
where 's that ?
get your coat
fwiw i was using go 1.5 from the golang-go package
well i am locked in because i will get a new machine in 2-3 months
mandel : i assume you are both using wily 's citrain right or the pinning wo n't be right unless
eeek , sorry ! !
you see at least auto eth0 and below a line starting with iface . paste that one line here
sure.. its *all* open , so , you can pretty much `` somehow '' do whatever you like . but
map ordering is my 2nd best nemesis : d
i 'm already dancing in the endzone
hmm , that template you pointed me at is the one i 'm using
from the store
you have a bunch of obsolete lines in here ... lines 14 , 15 , 22 , 32 , 54
possibly ctrl + pgup
please close gedit without saving
i never used it against a drive itself , just files to securely erase them , but i guess it
right , sorry - i tried to explain 3 times , but each time my connection dropped or something else
no , i get just a blinking cursor
no , i did n't see any - so we had a new custom tarball in the end ?
laravel means nothing to me . is the mysql db installed on the same server as your application ?
do n't waste our time with juvenile trolling
check what processes are consuming the resources . you can try ksysguard and sort by cpi
yes
sorry
ok , doing it now
yes
ok , try the legacy boot
ack
got some error about lack of display for x11 what is total bullshit becouse when trying to startx ( or
no
sure it does .
it 's a point cause i running this command normaly on my vm not on local ... on local i
i 'll re-do how i formatted the partitions before , could you watch along to see if i 'm doing
did this system have ubuntu/unity de on it ?
yeah i guess so
yes but there is no actif display
yes
man you deal with the installer now it 's all yours ; ) kinda critical bug too as it is
lets see
can you do this ...
you should look into proc_cn proc connector . that will tell you everything from the kernel = )
ah cool . som my `` plan '' right now would be to ask arges to let that version out
do you still have ubuntu on a flash drive , or dvd that you booted from to install ?
so did you install the packages the link told you to install for getting the latest enablement stack ?
i believe it mentioned in winehq
usually the kernel is problem free now
i do n't mind the lack of search , i 'm just tired of having to reinstall packages manually everytime
yes .
ah ok
did you include the period at the end of flashplugin-installer ?
there is one bug ( i do n't have it to hand ) that would make me so so so
add ppa : maas-maintainers/testing
lsblk -t /dev/sdb
interestingly they can be used for spacing values but not indentation .
one moment
ahhh , i see ... you need 3rd line support by the sound of it
you 're literally spamming right now
so it means link expired and launchpad is redirecting me to default login page ?
\o/ sorry for my confusion
( warning , have n't tested -- but i see no reason why it should n't work )
yes
hdmi or speakers output show ?
yep , it just changes the default value
ssh-keygen -t rsa ? ?
something like this maybe ? sudo mount -t nfs < ip address > : / < drivevolumename > / <
nein .
i can hear you
have you checked the s.m.a.r.t . status of your drive ? also , separate from this one issue , but
are you running ubuntu on any machines right now ?
ah , but hte filename is wrong for v3 , charmworld only looks for bundles.yaml
i agree - internally it may not be as useful ( unless u forsee more values coming in the future
the downloadable images are the `` ideal '' , where the in-cloud published images are pragmatic compromise .
seems like wily still has it
ok cntrl alt f1 ... lem me try
they do , but had my desktop do that stuff . : p
i only see `` assign '' `` abandon '' and `` edit ''
maybe something went wrong with the ubuntu install where grub is ?
i was n't really in `` troubleshooting '' mode , but i guess i could 've viewed it that way
it is an internal implementation detail , and the secondary write fails without it
still relevant , check the boot entries
i never thought about drm on an handheld pc ...
what alternative do you recommend ? xorg-edgers ?
hah , you are absolutely fine .
i will check with the ci folks ...
so `` charm url '' is technically wrong
very true
where do you see the issue ?
could we have the triggers exposed on the index somehow ?
cool cool
sure.. but , its the hardware that is the issue
thx : )
yes , saw a good groupon deal and decided to go for it . at the very worst it 'll
; )
i might need a better description than `` qt* ''
i would avoid doing system wide searches as they may take a bit
where do you find odesk ? it is not in the repos
pastebin `` free -m '' instead .
ok , so 4.2.0 rc8 does boot in smp mode
topic events
# vbox
i guess the error would be more obvious if i deleted /var/lib/apt/lists entirely from devel chroots .
let me check , maybe something happened during the night
this is just not the place to discuss that . this is just for ubuntu support
ooh cool ...
it is not default
oh , you mean our new project . talk to daftykins in -discuss , we have a surprise waiting there
because there is no x111 on the phone
then lets install std libs on stilson-07
no , for now that 's okay , especially that tpm testing requires a hell lot of manual interaction ,
read the manual for the software to find out ? : )
what is the exact filename you are using ?
great
i ca n't reproduce it anyway
i am just surprized that mom did n't flag that as a conflict
15.04 or rolling ?
whats that looks scary
the alternative is to pick a suitable format to use in the one bit of code ( losing any benefits
cool ... but concerning
or if you are ready , apply to become a motu = )
ok
maybe it 's a timing thing , but on xubuntu , when you click the `` reboot '' button from
i 've typically just used eclipse for java dev and lately just been using intellij so dunno about netbeans in
maybe the # # hardware guys can hint you on where to find these options for your mobo
sure
ok , is i t installed now 0.28 ?
i am glad i switched to this window manager
because pitti said this morning that it always failed on bluez and that he keeps skipping it
14.04.2 is just a point release . its like the servicepacks on windows . there is no 14.04.2 repo .
so what 's the problem ?
yeah , that was early days for mongo , our best practices were ... evolving
his name is on the uploads in staging
for hysterical raisins , many people have it aliased .
yes
it just says `` so edit to modify this file '' and then to restart apache , but it does
what changed that makes the tests start failing ?
great : )
i 'll try to move things around first , and then look at generators
i dont know , how can i check ?
bye : )
what are you asking me the meaning of ?
hm , we would still need the bind mount , unless we move /home/* to /writable/user-data/* ( which is probably
it 's a laptop using edp
so ~ refers to home - but i dont have a bin directory under home
need help ?
sure , but can you please check my driver upload to my staging ppa once i get that done ?
why yes , yes it should .
yes
in this case the unit started but i do n't think it took 90 seconds to finish
my first suggestion to try , would be to flash android 4.4.4 back on the device , boot completely to
thats looking awesome : d
or , if colin has context , what he said . : p
whoops i 'm wrong . so sorry
ok
this `` /sys/class/net/eth0/device/driver - > ../../../bus/pci/drivers/e1000e '' ?
how recent was the linux mint install ?
what do you get from `sudo journalctl -ex -u webdm_snappyd_0.9.2.service` ?
another nice alternative is to split the tests , one per click package . on the manifest we specify the
firewalls dont help anything
yeah got it to load into the os using the nouveau.noaccel=1 parama but its still a black screen , the
this behavior can be changed by my.cnf though
nice !
instead vroom contacted me in private because he was using deluge
the revision number should be chosen by the charmstore itselg
i like your description better : )
does `` insmod lspci '' and `` lspci '' list the controller the dvd drive is attached to ?
the basic `` sudo mount '' , or add them to fstab with ecryptfs type . also tried ecryptfs-recover-private
we should register one specifically for shotwell
you can use google-chrome -- app=url to turn off toolbars and such . perfect for netflix . ; - )
did you try disabling the floppy device in the bios ?
it seems to be still running some mint programs
the failing one is testmachineremovaltriggersworker
no , rather just sanity-check the diff
that can happen ?
you shouldnt
having said that , i suspect lock-passwd should be lock_passwd .
get involved by trickery and subterfuge
oh it just means that it wont save/restore the state of that application
oh ! i just tried on my laptop ... it does work there
ack
then it has to be an os thing ... i 'll try and find the article
yup , update solved the problem . hail to ubuntu ! ; )
it seems pretty broken to make /tmp read only ( and teach everything not to use it ) if we
let me do the code cleanup first , then i can hand it to you
yes i have mozilla
i fixed some of them in the past , but not everyone is feasible as it needs some x dependencies
there are even loads of those in the repo
i 'd have to google that too , ftm
so , i 'm setting it to abandoned
bon apetit !
anything else more i can do than filing a bug ?
okay , silo 19 is good to go !
so , i have a feeling that this is solvable somehow , i just do n't have enough quiet time
so do i but i thought i 'd run it past you
ubuntu 10.10 ( maverick meerkat ) was the thirteenth release of ubuntu . ! end-of-life on april 10th , 2012
see pm
yeah , i commented that jump in the mp
i mean is the executable flag set on the file itself ?
should probably be in ubiquity but i ca n't find it : ( (
or just provide a generic filter
yeah
nope actually , just browising the internet
which netbeans did not work
u sent me a message in jabber , but logged out ?
unfortunately , i 've tried all of that already
could you say which patches are applied to that build ?
14.04 - > 14.10 - > 15.04 - > 15.10 this ?
some video codecs use multiple cores
can you get the exact error ?
but we only pretend because otherwise people ask `` where 's dot whatever ''
what is it ?
whereas , i assume your sysroot is pure armhf , which is n't quite the scenario we packaged our cross-compilers
not from what i see ( kubuntu is the old install , ubuntu is the new one , both 14.10
do now what the file system is now , ext ?
no
oh , i see . no , it 's fine .
yes , you can use 'hwclock ' to do that
sure , and i understand what you are saying , but , thats literally the same guide i followed ,
do you have nfs mounts ?
yeh , it 'd probably be too slow on that even if you did have the space lol
yup if you just install the package can switch between em
the ui is a bit iffy but it 's all there
too many codes ? ; )
ah , hm , it 's an old change
?
it is fine now . i had edited the orig file . : )
perhaps we should track what 's changed in 1.3
inform yourself about supported for you country ok
what would you rather see ?
i have a meeting coming up , but i 'll pick this up after that .
great !
15.04 , gnome ( metacity ) , no , and no
now they do , so i assigned silos : )
is rtorrent there ?
is it a software kit or hardware ?
you saw the mailing list question about rackspace , right ?
nope , same error
i do n't have this file . my session is i3
i do n't think it should be
crap ... yet again the versioning trap - ubuntu-sdk-qmake-extras_3.5.1+15.04.20151005.1-0~7~ubuntu15.04.1.dsc : version older than that in the archive . 3.5.1+15.04.20151005.1-0~7~ubuntu15.04.1 <
yea ... the best you can do is post a bug report , but it would likely just be a
so it has fat read drivers and all itself ?
i am
without seeing some terminal output , it would be difficult to guess
what would you do with your finger if it could go through time ?
why ? a user 's finger lives in the physical world
+1
yep ...
sry i have n't sorted it out and frankly i am not getting the motivation to fix that .
good news : )
kdeconnect-kde is a transitional package so what you have is correct
if there is , i did n't spot it
cool : - )
ok , i 'll just push this up for review then .
heh , honestly i do really dislike that test
but yeah it would be nice to have a slick tool to tell you about denials
launch
yeah spreadsheet is fucked , trust the dashboard . also reload the spreadsheet before trying to use it , that
we do n't even have a proper overlay story with upstream
are you referring to the reboot issues ? ^^^
sure
not yet , i was afraid that i would lose you
you can burn .iso to dvd with brasero by example
cool , what is the next step ?
yeah . i just saw there were changes to those tests . i 've merged latest and rebuilding now .
ok , if it fails i 'd check the x.org log again but its ' timestamp first
sure , i 'll just delete it when we 're not using it ; )
any reason we should server /images from the root of the api ?
should i also wrap 'telegram ' string as translatable ? i suppose there may be languages where it would n't
we do not have the trust store in the desktop , that is not a problem when talking about the
in any case , that 's a questionable feature
me ?
ah , i see
so it does ... my autocomplete was not finding it for some reason .
no , with masking
ok , so follow the same construct/form ...
that 's entirely expected when trying to run grub-install from a livecd ( and why i mentioned `` properly ''
first thing i would do is try and casualy contact the maintainer of the ppa you are using
but i have no clue why
ta , appreciate it dude
point is that there shouldnt be anything to fix : )
and you do n't need a web site and an internet connection to do it . you can do it
that 's just how it is in 15.04 right now . dolphin4 with kate5
live cd mount every partition : )
how do you want me to proceed with this crash ? open a bug ? or ?
nevar !
yeah that 's what people do but they also write tons of other info in this field
are you a presenter , then ?
no idea ...
better ?
you can re-ask questions here once in a while
can other regular users see java ?
weird
please do n't kill it yet , i 'd first like you to run some experiments which would reproduce this
sure it 's lots better than before
i thought fuse is ntfs
huh , no , it really does hate you .
yeah it did revert , let me update it
yes , also teh dragmode
try , test print , did page come out ? if not , repeat .
your logic is wack
cool , no biggie , we all do it . ; )
damn for what ?
also , still no browser-friendly content headers before switching to the new shiny ? : (
the file system does n't matter
nope
the lib is not embedded in the click package , so if it is not installed on the system it
smplayer with mpv backing will do most all of that with ease as well
nfs has been available as a `` real solution '' for 20+ years on linux
did you check with -race ?
thx
i have several kernels installed . could this be the reason ? when you edit the /etc/default/grub file , are
like , put `` start on network up ; avahi-daemon start '' in /etc/init/avahi or whatever ?
first , do what daftykins suggested a moment ago
if your phone is slowing down because you have a few apps open , that is a bug
ok - bbs - got 2 to reboot with now
also the output of `` sudo parted -l '' .
no , get pid then kill -9 < pid >
e : not updated
yes .
cant i do something with live dvd ?
but should i see something on the console of the client1 vm ?
ubuntu net install w/ unrecognized hdd in the installer
are you asking about the libreoffice sru ?
great work !
