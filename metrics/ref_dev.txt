it does not ring a bell , i will have to install/test in a vm to debug further
i 'd have thought with the extended period over which 16.04 is going to be available , with sites moving
sure send me some links
wow , you 're difficult ... there are github issues for this with selendroid . have a read around those
there is your problem .
i 'd assume so .
part of one yes , this is the raw c source file for several modules .
but band names shakes it up a bit : )
or 2015 in the uk
no i 've been using linux for about 8 months now
well , you should 've release it first for 15.04 i guess . till october is still more than a
i 'm assuming that
oh , no , that 's just because 602.2 is sitting in propose . just force_rebuild it and it 'll
this is not `` chat '' .. its , as the /topic describes , an official support venue for the
just remember that while you may be using the 14.10 framework , you are still using ubuntu.components 1.2 which is
alright so it 's not even technically meant to run reliably on there . what 's the name of the
so you back up everything first
i might have a baby in arms potentially crying at that time , but for something private should be fine
or needs updating
looks like i 'm a list moderator now , but no password : )
the convention would be `` desktop '' vs `` dvd ''
so ^ yes you can creat the direcory , but what is the end goal .
cat /proc/cmdline
how 'd you log in as root ?
all i can see is that it exited with rc=1
will probably take 15 minutes to diff
so boot into bios and set vt-x ?
this affects calc/clock/weather btw
i 've got mysql at around 5 % , then 10 php-cgi process each at ~1.5 % , and those
no partition at 100 %
there 's many ways . depending on if you wan na use a gui or cli .
i am sorry to say it was not . it was os related ( not hardware , because on same
did he need actually for /root & /boot , he can just set up /
if you have trouble finding it , open up terminal and try amixer .
the first case of the test plan
better ?
might be a process failure if `` dual landing '' implies `` hack around breakage in the devel series ''
is the build blocked ?
good . none of their build take more than 30min
the result is : 2401257+0 records in
15.04 is still in development
no problem
ogra_ : all right i am booted into 128 - let me know if you want me to do any
i get a similar error
i 've pulled your branches with the foreports and once i 'm done with live testing themue 's changes i
it 's that first pastebin.. its all the error i get
thsnks let me check it out
good night !
try rebooting when you are finished .
htop probably i use a conky , swappiness is the key if it is
just to see output before adding -i
so providerid can be anything , so but you 're not validating it anyway , right ?
oh ... meant to say , i did n't delete , cause it said entry was from ci train bot
hello : - )
e.g . call setstate on a new alive address
how can i check 100 % that the buffer has been posted and is getting input ?
you must be comparing to your modified version , and not the exact ubuntu version
you tested 14.04 for same issues ?
i 'd even go further and suggest having a type porttype uint16 in the network package and use it everywhere
is the patch released ?
you said you had held and broken packages , the update/dist-upgrade will show us what is up .
i want configure ipv6 on all my docker containers and i have just only one public ipv6 . is it
ack , /me pulls mouse
can you close that other alt-f2 environment bug if it 's fixed by this ?
would you show me the script ?
its good
k
that could we good , also the output of dbus-monitor can be interesing
right .
strace maybe ?
and we have one more translation in lp and you learned some new language . win-win
no
cute to read , might be confusing to debug
( if you could exemplify on your npipe package what the result should be ; that would be awesome )
using env/path its clear the proxy is set for my corporate proxy . but when looking at sample connection (
number 2 was setup when there where a bunch of conflicts with only 1 .
so it doesnt matther which mirro i download from ?
will do , i do n't have access to the hardware where i am right now , however i will
yeah , quite a bit ; we 'll probably arrive an hour late or so , no big deal
who knows
np ... any particular change that you are implementing ?
i use a package manager to do so
( which you can move )
by that i just mean , for example when doing dual boot lvm can not be used and so on
python is dynamically typed , not php or javascript which change depending on how you 're using it , the
yeah
chouf le5ra `` gnome , libreoffice , translation project ... etc . ''
uniter assignedmachine , getownertag ... these take params.entities
sorry , that does n't answer your question : \
what would you say if # hardware says that 's ubuntu problem ?
14.10 is the beta technically
they 're going to have to fix it eventually
installer finished successfully .
thnx for ur time and insight : )
i 'm testing it too
note : installing from .deb , as you attempted , does n't get the dependencies .
-p < port >
how did you install the firmware ? did you install it with apt-get install firmware-atheros ?
not saying you should install x on the server - just use x on the client to avoid doing everything
he 's having issues connecting to one of those open connections . i suspect it 's one of those which
yes . at the time the wily images failed to boot for me .
upstream 's git
whats the issue ?
yeah , there
but that 's ok i got the info i needed , ill let you know whenever this is ready to
ok , check for the initrd : `` ls -l /boot/ '' you should see , amongst others , ``
ha , i ca n't even look at them myself ; )
yes , and it stopped growing when i added the patch
sudo systemctl start service_name
you might wan na look at realteks website for latest linux drivers/firmwares also
well in both cases they report theoretical errors before they happen . but still to get that far you need
thnx : d
try to modify the file again , as it was , hd1
well , what about 16.04 for example ?
while the long tail : )
ok , sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get upgrade & & sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
it is , i use it for video editing a lot .
i saw a bug with plans to parse that instead of returning key error . is that going forward ?
connecting directly to the computer ?
yep , just force it
so just ask .
i would reflash to ota8
ubuntu doens't use sendmail by default
which package are you talking about ?
you 've been given it three times now .
exactly
he can switch to tty1 , dunno about num lock . i made him useradd a new user and now
i found it in the tarball for 1.23-beta3
pete woods added it with other scope facing apis
the upgrades/downgrades may well be a red herring , and he may just have a racy boot that 's showing
+1
are you trying to run the live session while you 've got another installed , and sync the two ?
likely in your .bashrc you have a line like `` path= $ path : ~/bin '' or similar
right , then we can just leave it as it is i guess
what 's the install ?
as in now ?
other times both die
no luck in what way ?
no
opaque identifiers are good things
you mind if i start a hangouts chat ?
yes , and i marked it as passed
the 'backport creation ' page suggests using a ~ delimiter
well my very advanced linux friends hate pulse but say it 's here to stay . skype also needs pulse
it 's okay , seems to be offtopic time ; - )
seems alright and expected
details matter `` my car is broken '' will not help the mechanic find whats wrong , too : )
the lock screen locks the computer during upgrade to 15.10 , and there is no way to come back
how do you stop your service ?
feel free to backport 200 packages by hand
okay , # android can show you how to connect to your phone over linux
it 's not listed .
yeah , quite often each one requires something slightly different
kay
ok - and put it where ?
hateball : cfhowlett : i use rm -r and it works !
you do n't .
usability == redirecting qemu output
i 'd do the same without thinking twice
absolutely , you want my environments.yaml for that environment ? and what else ? any log files or other information
boot the drive in efi ..ok
hi
yes it is
moments
sure
yeah , my 'workstation ' and my dev machine are right next to each other .
i gave you the correct answer , i 'm 100 % serious : )
but , how to stopping rabbitmq ?
then it 'll install the release pocket version only .
nvidia-prime replaces it
your user , your home
yes i use that myself all the time .
ah , okay
you wan na dualboot touch and windows then ?
test and see that it is good.. new is unknown.. and can be broken .
i even just assigned to me and everythign
i see . and we ca n't modify the rules to work with both 1.2 and 1.4 ?
i was running `` mpstat -p all ''
i 've already replied to your bugreport
so run lsusb and find all the info on that cam , names can be just not enough or even
that 's a *great* idea !
not with the aplay command ?
and having `` focus : true '' on the dialog as well
i 'd like to , but i ca n't run qemu-based dep8 tests locally since that needs a daily cloud
did you install the package nvidia-prime ?
are you sure your disk is reliable ?
no problem .
that 's why i said above , the `` focus '' is wrong in more than one place . modules/ubuntu/components/textfield.qml
heh , after reading the apport source : apport_disable_distro_check=1 ubuntu-bug linux
oh , the cxlflash patches . i 'll take 'em from the lp report if they have n't appeared upstream
i use it every deay without problems ... since about 6 months ... and many many others out there do
i already mentioned that , no ? or maybe i did n't
i investigated today and afaiu the problem it should have happened on 4.x as well
but that 's chicken and egg then . the train ca n't know whether there are packaging changes until after
did you try reformat the drive and test write ?
what are you trying to achieve ?
it still leaves the question that other upstart jobs that expect static-network-up will never get it
mirror.bytemark.co.uk normally saturates my cable
no typing in wrong window it seems
this code always generates the same mac address ...
in the theming mr , what 's with the docs ? in uctheme.cpp you have the same as in ucdeprecatedtheme.cpp
did you set the upstream dns server in maas ?
i do not see any problem that you are on amazon , you still have console access , right ?
in your latest comment , you say `` we should be passing a full id ( e.g . `` my-proc/some-id
your first silo is 015 !
fwiw , ibm 's also pretty focussed on hwe kernels and point releases . as in , they ship point
: d i assumed ... for example the reminder app needs it build time
oh , good catch . let me see if i can stop jenkins .
that should do the trick , since you cant have 2 managers at the same time anyway
had you tapped on the screen at all ?
i forget now - when i first installed 15.10 i noticed something had a private mysqld running , so i
with browser
yes
you 'd have to drag each thign into place and that 's a complex ui to get right .
but ca n't ssh to the raspy
*sigh*
which one ?
do n't need an emulator for sandbox
yeah
and if the life of the local copy is dead then there is no change anyone else can or will
it has been a problem ever since i re-installed ubuntu 14.04 from scratch on the laptop
nope ... . screen still goes off . i believe it machine is still running ( cl+alt+del still reboots the
although i can apply their packaging to 1.8.x , which i do in the ppas anyways
the hard-core version is to create a domain-specific library in c++ and then create c++ code from the archive and
i tried various docks including docky and cairo dock . i dont think i 'm a `` dock '' kinda
yes . try to follow the instructions i type
ideally we can piggy back on kdeconnect and add gtk2/3 interfaces .
on it
cool
approximately 1 minute after it is released
also can i delete duplicate entries ... i got logged out while saving one clicked again .
even if i do n't have an nvidia gfx card ?
might be
it 's ok anyways you just lose 2 gbs of disk space , is n't much
afaik , it needs to be scripted in debian/rules
heh , yep , just fixed that in trunk but probably wo n't roll it out until tomorrow
it does n't work if i just export it
there will be more : )
there is no `` vim-full '' or anything similar
and to do that , you have to mount it manually .
unless you have a really good reason for it and you can sell # ubuntu-release in the change
gah , typo
can we get osci pointed at the odl-controller branches ?
he had installed from usb stick removed after the installation
it boots into black screen still t_t
not afaik
no idea about that user , it looks like a guest session user but it 's odd that it 's
no worries
yeah figured that out now it was just the only difference i could think of
well he could just rename it himself , it would be way quicker
let me search
yeah . unfortunately the train needs that info in a bunch of different places so not caching that is super
so you use lightdm but you used freedesktop files ... .which probably wo n't work
the virtualization extensions may be turned off . i run into that a lot on some hardware .
good call btw ; )
what happened between the point it worked and when it did n't
if you run all the ui tests on your branch some more will fail
+1 to your fix given the point you make about the scope of leader_get in peer storage
i am instaling lubuntu desktop
i did fix his permissions with the binary a bit ago .
any reason for that other than no one wanted to ?
yes - the portions of the panel would still be the same would n't they
right click , properties
i 'm on vivid , which is plasma 5 by default
you install the sdk on which version of ubuntu ?
has that powerpc image actually been tested ?
no era
oh goodie
it did fix the test that was failing previously at least
people `` fixing '' their computers to have zero security is a little tiring .
yeah ... we thought about that already ... will bring it up again
have you tried a different de then ?
why do we do that ?
so the container is not up ( `` 1 '' :
just download the iso of 15.10 ?
oh ? i did n't realize 14.04 could boot with systemd well enough to use..
there is a job called wily-adt-setup-testbed which calls autopkgtest/tools/adt-buildvm-ubuntu-clound
they can only write to ~/.local/share/com.app.id or ~/.cache/com.app.id or similar
no , from one of the ssds
sure
i squeed like a schoolgirl
trying unity8.shell.tests.test_rotation.testrotationwithapp.test_rotation_with_webbrowser_app again ...
but kwin has been redesigned for plasma5.x i believe
please use the command i gave you
well , upgrades in the apt sense : )
feel free to use /ignore
mgz - yw . thx for the focus on this .
readlink /usr/bin/foo
that is entirely possible ,
see above . would work fine if i need it to just run once , but this needs to be
any chance i can access it remotely ?
on the qml/c++ tutorial card , would you mind adding a link to the tutorial and marking the bug as
think it would be possiable to get a few ( like 10 ) in another language ?
so what do i have to do ?
i will try to run firewall-config from dash real quick , good though
when you do run across bugs , *please* report them
did you try sudo find /home/ < your user > ... .. ?
`` sudo cryptsetup luksopen /dev/foo fooname '' then `` sudo mount /dev/mapper/fooname /mountpoint '' should work ?
how is it in there then ?
well penk could monday
so you 've added the user , and all your after is adding them to the sudo group yes ?
i 'm digging plasma 5
sounds like a plan
eric^ said just kernel i givet him the kernel
cheers
bq rtm ?
salut , same as every day ( maybe started irc some 15 minutes earlier )
for the protocol , for sure ! nice trick
no idea
^^
really
to test puk , yes
last time the os failed to let me in was a cold boot
have you picked up much about juju and arm via osmosis ?
there is 'ufw ' , which is a gui for those 'iptables ' . read more about the program at
with what though ?
ok. if you are done here , please /part . this is a no-idling channel .
so we are stuck with the u-c-c stack then ? things like `` unity-control-center | gnome-control-center '' just do n't
haha
so you have got an interface in general ( in include ) , then you have a stub for the
fresh install + backports ppa for 5.3
# # git ? : )
uname -a
because icmp is not tcp transit
a lack of contact implies an unwillingness to participate
no it probably downloaded it somewhere
for the most part yes - but it has been half a dozen of us
interesting . the echo `` '' | nc just sends a blank string to the remot ehost and returns what
can we start making bugs in this staqe ?
so backports ppa in ok ?
counter strike global offensive . its hands down the best game i have ever played
from my perspective , pyenv only makes things more complicated
can you disclose ?
the password ( passphrase ) you should know it
apparmor profiles can be applied to a running process afaik .
is that safe while upgrade is still running ? ( i suspect it has passed the virtualbox bit )
last year czajkowski did n't drink a drop as she was driving jon ( crazy )
so it needs drwxrwxr-x ?
it 's ubuntu-snappy.boot-ok.service
sudo apt-get build-dep xubuntu-docs ?
is there widget styleable ?
those are autostarted
do you have access to the router firmware ?
one last reminder , you were also going to 'followup with kernel team regarding the bug # 1423810 and #
i am using nvidia driver 340.2
download and install them .
i downloaded desktop ver .
right but nothing major right ? ( a simple apt-get dist-upgrade fixed it for me )
please do n't message me anymore .
it should just be called uniter i believe
gitlab or git in general ?
i do n't think anything can be done ; i would of liked phablet-shell run_command as well ; - )
so grab the mini iso around 60mb , and build up ; you could have it running in the next
i m there
same for all 'buntu flavors
i thought there was a urihandler component provided by the sdk which one can you to get the data from
when you run 'nmap -sp 192.168 . *.0/24 ' where * is the number assigned on your local network ,
the reason i immediately called `` nah , it 's not hung '' , is because the last bit in
al i know is that will do a clean start , without dns cache if existing
yes . same result
so you ca n't get to the machine right now ?
which one is advicable ? fizzy_changeling k1l
happy2help !
desktop here and laptop both have network manager problems
oh . why ?
hostname issues are generally cause by dns server problems
how do you know that ?
we 'll do a mass give-back once the world is happily transitioned .
lsof ... has along list attached , but it dont make any sense to me .
given our `` each app has ownership of its produced data '' , ...
done
open a terminal : cd desktop & & sudo sh ./ < name-of-the-thing > .run
license/copyright owners
cool , how do i do that wrt changing the mp ?
telnet !
yeah , maybe . weird though , since again , it worked fine under 14.10 . it 's not like
where is it ?
well , that sounds sensible for subnets , but after spending > 1h fiddling with indices , uniqueness , etc
sudo ; )
there 's a couple of existing mrs that should the sort of changes needed to add a new layout ,
it shows the total number of downloads for each currently published version .
if you have , say , 3 ubuntu 's , or linux's.. and blow one out , and go into
that 's just the motd ( message of the day ; like the one on irc ) . here 's
open a terminal and just type that
actually , something happens . the contacts disappear .
no idea .
it should be okay - but if not you can always revert to a previous kernel .
do you know why the `` self.assertthat ( self.page , notequals ( none ) ) '' that you removed was
no problem - i 'll talk to is , they 'll get your credentials revoked
but it might be easier to just re-bootstrap
ok
so two days ago i tested all this and got it working
this is why it takes a little longer to test but no errors when calculating what needs to be installed
clearly you 've never looked at my php
are you sure that the kernel image compiled correctly ?
nice - enjoy !
^
type their nick .
^
i am using the drivers for their aosp build , they are the same as cyanogen mod uses
you should be getting the xcursors from dmz white theme
i do n't believe so , but i never use it .
ah , no idea , usually there is precursor you remember any preceding activities as a cause ?
updated
it 's stable now with the separate thread for flipping disabled right ? before it was slightly unstable ?
i guess we 're too late to get an update in vivid . : (
tj- : i understand . once you type in the username , and password . it sits there for a
daftykins mounting things ?
yeah , a bootstrap of krillin and it 's broken
cd /path/to/folder
yes i do n't see why not
wait , still debootstrapping with that
can i tell citrain to forcefully merge your upload to trunk ?
there is the 'sleep ' command that will stop the executing of a script for a specified number of seconds
thats the wrong way to do it imho
ah , that sounds familiar - graphics card overload
yes he was saying the hardware was having issues with that phone that yeah . that the screen was n't
who knows ,
i saw that it fails on trusty as we do n't have the test script in dkms there yet
cd /var/log - > > sudo du -sx * | sort -n . see which is so large .
consuming the data ?
u suspect it wont work until the ubuntu branches get re-based on a newer android hal
nice , ok did you see the comments beneath that post on the askubuntu page ?
i was used to centos / rh
i do n't think you can delete the json .
did you try f12 yet
no problem . feel free to ask any other questions that you may have : )
i 'm trying to find info for you , i hope others here will pitch in : d
that would be awesome
should be ready in the next 30 minutes .
where do you work ? in pta or jhb
i 'm a little `` spooked '' by ubuntu 's `` abandonment '' of xen ( that was awhile ago
no , we find that folks search with terms . we 'll do the recommended filter by series in the
ty
cookies ?
ubuntu livecd , if that still works..
after an update perhaps ?
it 's not , it does n't install the python3 path properly
regardless , it should be very fast to finish up
if you just run it outside of upstart , same ? same for the installed version ?
any errors ?
oh wow that 's awesome lol
without know what command you ran to get that , i would n't be able to say for sure .
btrfs is less stable than ext4 . if you are going to make good use of its features , like
it does n't
good point
confirmed - missing exports here as well .
right , so it looks like none of the files are installed anywhere
the `` under development '' is still in the docs packages
any ideas ?
never had a prob with it .
so yeah , everything looks the same in my retrace
any reason to keep them private ?
yes , w.r.t . other errors > errdying
but still no fix : s
happy2help !
tail showed everything normal to me , try same with dmesg
: ) maybe
one sec
it 's a 32-bit app . it 's probably having an issue with some 32-bit library dependency .
did i create t or shall i just re-try ?
ah , installing outside of apt would probably be a source of `` wonky behavior '' .
ca n't see..
whatever the installer labelled as `` minimal lubuntu '' which i assumed was n't actually a meta and rather a
md5 check sums are the same so the iso file is okay
this is not in the mail : i can do the following : keep sending patches for symbols files like
you do n't need dpkg that much , you can skip it .
on linux ensure the basics ; the vnc service is listening on a port , there are no firewall rules
sorry , i meant u-d-f
relax
no , automagic is bad
and we ca n't use ~ubuntu-server for ppas because it 's open aiui .
i contract work my skills through workmarket.com
probably you have to create own config file
it 's just that i have a working setup and it would be a pain to redo : )
why should be dual monitor a problem with comic strip ?
you 're chasing a supposed street cred social/cultural bogus idea . unity is tiny , it is a plugin in
i have connected recent iphones on 14.04 without problem
i 'm thinking it is defaulting to power-save mode
well ... my problem was that the gles11 stuff seemed custom to android ( and maybe ios )
i suspect that the installer does n't require hardware accelerated graphics , but the ubuntu unity desktop does .
i see
you 'll take anything as a yes ...
i expect the current code will be plagued with false negatives ( failures that are n't real failures ) because
i build directly on the phone , so i would n't know much about that . sorry
not sourceid ?
yes

rescue is fine
but yesterday night for 8 hours it copied 1,3 gb . so far in what ? 20 mins . it
exporting or not exporting test suites is an approach ( pattern ? ) not a naming semantics ... no ?
but that will stop working soon as well ... since we check for the screen lock state
that 's to re-try landing it . but that goes further than what dobey wanted
as sometimes we introduce something that fails on python3.2
see , if i ran a flavour , i *think* what i 'd do is let some tech lead declare
you probably want kubuntu-desktop to pull in all the extras
it is . but since its non-free you will buy that and ask them for support
`` properly '' is probably relative
i did restart even.. cause i had to anyway after updates
ok , are they needed , eg : have the patches been rolled up into the current version for 16.04
yeah , what do i do next ?
what 's your question ?
reverts r always painfull and 1.24 takes priority over my branch ( against master ) anyway
jep , 34 % charged
you wan na mirror or exend
yes , that 's what we need , supporting a third init system : )
do we plan to have a mode like described on the mockup i just mentioned ?
with me around your nick is a very bad choice in here : )
any recomendations to recover files from the raw file ? testdisk maybe ?
yes , i see that now . i 've created the xenial series in the distro , so it 's
np
ok . so lets talk a little bit about the network that the server is on
/etc/group shows my username belongs to docker group
if you 've ever run visicalc or microsoft works in dosbox then you know what i 'm talking about .

hm , there is something wrong with the scheduler , last run were 2015-01-09 07:51 , 2015-01-11 11:13 , 2015-01-13
so copying it in wo n't work

i dont ' know what 's best considering the plan . it 's seems to be an ofono bug and
i 'd do a quick check on the hdd health first , just in case it 's screaming because of
are you in ubuntu right now ?
location is known to be not slow/not accurate on vivid images ?
ack , not a huge problem as that 's a build dependency only anyway
you could try booting to a live disc/usb
^
you work in a mine ?
which is totally unrelated .
so many fiddly bits
on which time zone are you , i 'm going out for a bit . i 'll be happy to
but i get an error when doing juju bootstrap
it could even get you different binary behavior ...
ok .
i thought that - before the -i were attributed to the -i file ?
= )
but then more weirdness happens
what api call is returning 401 ?
can you paste me the error ?
ah that 's interesting . this would be easier if i could figure out dual-boot . i installed ubuntu but
if you 're a newbie then stick with an lts for a few years . then you 'll be able
still , if you 're in a space , it seems to define that you have direct access to other
probably stuck then ?
updated the page , add what to the menu ?
go to github.com/ubuntu-core/snappy . you 'll have fun there .
rc is 15.04
neat , great . i 'm out of questions : )
it should get the same name as the name in maas
to the site linked in the topic , e.g .
broken
or # ubuntu-offtopic
nmap
what did you backup with ? clonezilla ?
danke .
my gut feeling is `` almost '' or even `` yes ''
which plan did you buy
i hear the political climate for such actions is welcoming in the uk right now , given you just outlawed
i 'm seeing if i can get the other value out of the keystone api
lxde has least amount of gtk dependencies
: d
ah k
they were already checked
so erm feel free to cancel the meeting any time ; )
type startx once you 've logged in to the gui and tell use what happens
awesome ( commented )
ok leave it for me tomorrow
i am *not* using kubuntu
next time the pc boots it 'll make /dev/sda6 an encrypted block device using a key from /dev/urandom , createa
option no . 5 is my internal speakers which are my standard output . normally
robru : i 'm publishing
ironically , i was a huge fan of the original gnome .. but over the years , i 've become
however , although it is an old book , i can found some useful information from it .
i 'd *think* so ... actually especially since those were built in separate build jobs
it 's all good now
exactly : - ) ( fwiw , i wrote /usr/sbin/service many moons ago )
but the server is ubuntu . there is no windows in the schema
i meant the actual releases , not the release team
that is standard since 14.04 , iirc . but that depends on what setup you install exactly .
yes , i agree .
please
a possibility for sure - i 'll look over the tstamp handling code while we 're waiting for the debugging
will add an abstractstage.qml then
that is always active , thus it is active no matter of where are used
does the slide transition work ?
it will go out when ready : ) but i guess in 1-2 weeks .
but i ca n't see a robust way to do that and i 'd rather do nothing than something inherently
sudo apt-get install powertop
i was n't going to bring it up < wink >
i could build an ubuntu image to run on my mouse too , if i wanted to
it 's all good , it worked the first time
what 's your daemon interfacing with ?
do you have virtualbox or something where you can run an ubuntu vm ?
but why do you run cmake if there were no cmake changes ?
yeah do n't have any encrypted partitions so not really sure , i do n't have the need for local
fighting it is the first confirmation of drama
sorry , but i do n't understand what you mean on this .
the tap to click is disables the left mouse click with a single finger but not two finger right click
mmmm any app that uses audio could , if `` mis '' -configured
oh dear , consider backups in future . have you tried mounting the ntfs partitions at all ?
well , someone here kind of told me off for trying to use it
yes , same problem
that points to your bundle file
right , i installed nothing ... just mirroring on my system in response to your initial query
push it to a branch asap so we can see what you did
can you schedule a meeting next week ?
freeing up space is the fastest way to get more free space .
yeah i can get to that later
well i share in your : ( that we 're not there for you .
sure.. one min..
yeah
is wine working ?
never mind ...
not the entire time , but a good majority
the segfault is not great but you get the wifi list , that 's what i wanted to know
it will depend on my state patch
should i run tests ?
5.4.2
they ca n't
yes , at least the aborted suspends are much higher
kidding
^ is a passive process . gather information .
i bet the one in /target/grub/ is older ?
ah
ahh
that is a 3rd party repo you added . talk to kernel.org : )
no it 's definitely not
strange , can you post both , the conf.old and /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf ?
and then once we 're ready/sure it 'll be fine merge your forked branch of the docs into trunk
`` world writable : '/usr ' ''
you should try using that ascii gui driver for the x server : d
i can add a comment with // there is a binding loop here
is the q & a at 1600 utc or 1700 utc ?
good luck man ; d
if the person forcing the migration also has first-hand knowledge that the tests will pass after unrelated-bug-x is fixed ,
you can use the qt render loop debugging
so it is in some way all your fault : -p
it could be that an old api call to get status is being made , and hence sub status is
good to know , adding to my bag of tricks
yes , never mind .
looks good ot me !
how to restart cups service ?
it conflicts with systemd-sysv , no ?
maybe making a bootable usb ?
previously it did n't work
oh i meant for charm-helpers
you 're not a developer though , so it 's not a big deal
swap has a lock by it and i can not delete it ...
older versions are n't supported and are unlikely to work any better
you ca n't really do oop in asm , so it 's not really playing in the same league :
if we did n't apply it how can we mention the drop ? : d ( just joking )
cool , nice find
im used to settign this stuff up via gnome
its my windows 7 partition
the gotchas will be obvious as you go through , a nd you can put it back , easily
now i understand
yup , i also think so .
thnx ! that 's what at least 2 cases of scotch now ? .. : d
i see that 's possible to log in as lxde , not lubuntu.\
thats the only thing that is mentioned ^
i fried all of /var/apt/lists/* and run it again to be double double sure
yes
that 's what i have , odd .
ok , rejected
no interest in doing that . my samsung s3 is gathering dust
sounds nice , indeed : )
yes
they 're not hmm included as default repositories , rather , a backport is kinda a hotfix issued for some
hehe
then if your pc has openssh-server installed ... he can use sftp on filezilla to send you the file
i removed the ban before you did
they did n't work ? what happened ?
all i was saying that it jumped at me : )
looking
oh wait ... so it crashed when you pressed the save button ?
that page links to the archive , it 's just nicer than remembering the deep links .
i can certainly try
do n't worry
well , why do you care what youtube recommends for me ? that 's for me to know , not
yup adding -- keyword=_ did the trick
we should include them to announce that for everybody : )
manual merge and resolve it later ? : p
no , you said you saw a bluetooth service error message
yes but the -f is probably not needed
or just kde5-nm-connection-editor
and it did create the random strings just fine now ( so that only seems to be a warning )
deleting in nautilus should move it there
)
out of scope here . we were talking about wifi cards/dongles ; )
i was trying to click the uninstall button and found out that i was trying to click a button that
ok , i 'll approve this anyway , but please try making sure next time ( when the tests are
the paste runs ppa-purge
you mean i should make the always visible ? regardless of the selected field ?
oh , so an upload was n't made into the archive yet ?
nvidia recommended in system settings/driver manager
you keep asking the same questions . i 've told you what to do . report back when you '
picky , picky .
yah , that 's how i always did it in nautilus . for the life of me i can not
no ip
there was , but it 's settled down for the time being
the algorithm looks like this
the column is useful even without the setbranch rework .
or some sort of sharing from the real one
it was advertised on fb
i can ask srini to double check .
i will once beta x or rc1 gets out
system still boots using grub
new keyboard is retarded
scroll up..
i will though have an ubuntu phone in tow , so maybe i could come along to a ubuntu-ca meeting
just send me pictures of what you see and what do you wan na do
it should n't hard-code to true ...
newver mind , i see what you did there - tried restarting ?
more fun news is that with terminal `` movies '' does not show the same content
yea sure i was just asking genrally , maybe i overlooked something , so far i learned only about strace
yes
ok : go to system-settings > updates & software . then the last tab `` prop . drivers or smth
i 'd be honoured to be at the end of a linus rant , would mean i 'm worthy of
grub does n't like installing to partitions , because it knows it can not be booted that way
great that what i did , but why then i cant run it with my personnal user ?
going through batuan ?
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
it should install its own deps
double check - > sudo apt-get -f install , sudo dpkg -c < - . if these run clean you
theres no swearing here buddy
ok , migration phase looking good
i am 35
have you merged stable yet ?
and two gcc uploads means the queues will explode shortly .
type sudo chroot /mnt
do you have wget installed ? : )
i 'm thinking of getting 10 of everything
understood . sadly not helpful at this point . going to reflash kitkat and start again to see if something
wubi is for testing purposes . it will break you ubuntu and possibly your windows , too . so make
yes
i 've been prototyping this to `` combat '' csd .
nope , the phone number needs to be 'orange ' ( it is weird to call it a phone 'number
thnks , i 'll note that in the bug
and what are you trying to do ?
looks like libglut is not his prob
apt-cache search indicator in your terminal
the addresser does n't use the provider
why all the extra hassle ?
meaning
i do n't *have* to change that . ( at least not for a stable form . )
does language-selector work with packagekit ? we 're looking at removing aptdaemon .
then why are you using encryptfs ?
bash based or web based
i mean wich device are you using and wich ubuntu touch channel running on it
yes , i 'll give you a link to the click on my chinstrap .
so , do you think we are ready to ( try to ) include calculator in ota ?
so far , i just need a true or false in that json . federico is working on saving the
deleted , and the *-setup-lxc ones too
the rest should be fixed by that mr
i was hoping for something a little more personal , especially when doing an interview with someone
what should i do to goose it into action when that happens ?
did you add my sddm_kcm package to 5.2 beta ?
seems hard for me
what does `` fdisk -l '' output ?
i did n't make dummy provider configurable because it 's not needed as part of this pr
the archive version has my multiarch patches since 2012
yes , i can review and sort those bits .
yeah , that 's the weird thing ! there 's nothing in /var/cache/lxc/wily
no i 'm asking the version number : )
`` i tried all '' is not very helpfull to get some help
nope , how to test it : )
compiling an older kernel is very easy , so you could try that if you have some time
but i did n't think anyone got it
windows salutes you : d
: ( ( (
can you read this ? have i been muted ? : (
unlike my benzine tank : p
i 've pushed a reorg of the cpos . please review it anad let me know what do you think
any luck ?
the hash of the .iso file is different than the ones on the website ?
i also only have 42 cores around the house , maybe half of those are hyperthreaded .
^ should we clean manually or wait for the boottest problems be resolved by ci ?
ok cool . there is uncertainty on my end partly because 1.3 appeared on devices , but there was never
crap ... .ok thxs ! ! !
well , if the gamepad is connected , it should just be like any other input device ( mouse/keyboard )
some of it seems redundant ( except for get_number_of_sessions ) and i just wanted to clarify
should i just dput in a silo ? or how does that work ?
well its the only way to be sure
filled in a bug for this bileto issue
i dont know much about it
yes
sure cat .xsession-errors | nc termbin.com 9999
we would only support what is in the ubuntu repos , not a very good plan is all either .
sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdev setup
how do you plan on achieving that ?
and since i was getting similar timeouts with app search , i suspected some common component
qemu-img convert -o qcow2 xx.raw xx.img
ah , that could explain it thnx : )
if it 's a forward port of an already reviewed pr with minimal additional changes then it does n't need
that is a valid reason ...
i 'll give it a go on my maas now as it has all ranges set
what do you scare more : ubuntu fixing security issues right when there is a fix for it or microsoft
this means another server running
sounds good to me
read the docs . i hase no idea about tor
use the webupd8 ppa
just waiting on a review from fwereade
yep
yip i 've got no idea why those are incompatible then
when you 're running servers , sure
it looks solid enough for proposing - minus those few suggestions
i 'm poking around cmd/jujud/main.go where we read from stdin and pass it in with the jujuc.request
any lasting solution ?
can you send me your email ?
oh , yeah that was my mistake
wait 1
hit return by mistake
pull that out , test it separately , and then test that startserialwaitparallel calls it properly
ha ! i did n't see that . am going blind in my old age ; )
are you using python or bash ?
oxygen-icons5 needs ecm
anywho got ta sleep : ) good luck o/
try switching ttys . if that does n't work , try getting a gentoo install disk or ubuntu install disk
ask your question ?
right
ls -a will show hidden files
i did n't override it by default as antti 's review and approval was of an earlier version
nice working getting that far
is there any `` whitelist '' to allow my pc as trusted ?
if you wanted to make an mp where we can give order info to the sections , i 'd gladly
alrite
it 's not there
is that with your dbus fix branch too ?
i have one better
look at the partitions with gparted and see how big it is or what layout is there
how big is the partition you 're trying to mount ?
try it out and stuff..
`` sudo ecryptfs-recover-private /target/home/.ecryptfs/ $ { user } /.private '' - assuming you 've mounted the root file-system at /target/
ok , you know it better than me : )
but all in all qa is testing it already
konsole on utopic + plasma 5.2 beta
so if /etc/machine-id is _empty_ , we seem to be fine .
never mind ... i just saw your comment on the bug
err , oh . yeah . i read that as 'apt ' , not 'python-apt ' . i 'm not
plz
not just that though
the orion theme is unmaintained though , so it wo n't work very well with latest gtk3 versions
you told me /var/log/
bug 1104476
anything else or are we stuck ?
i need that , for sure .
well they did n't release it so the existance of a port does n't help us much
ok , so you 've already been doing 'stuff ' in this live session then ?
feel free to argue with doko about the debian/ubuntu default before then , though . : p
your card doesnt use the right driver ...
indeed : )
obviously the group permissions as well as ownership , if you want the other to read or write
?
why ?
because it 's a new moon and the helper gods are asleep : )
it 'll be even worse , skylake is too new : )
that 's cause i put it up yesterday , maybe ? ; )
they 're cheap . they fail frequently . always have a spare
please check your dolphin repo
be sure the cd is a 'good ' cd ...
it 's possible that libc6-dev : armhf conflicts with another package
im sure you will mate
ah ... i ca n't test on the pc ; )
the file is found
good idea . let 's see if i hit the same compile error to reproduce that bug
yeah , i am the one asking ... sec , guys , almost done
but there are 2d fall back modes if you do n't have one
oh , also please mention `` ( lp : # 1472510 ) '' in the changelog so it auto-closes .
nginx is more lightweight
do you have a separate /home ?
ok , does n't look too bad ; and i see miklos made the overlay filesystem type 'overlay ' ,
does the default gateway get set ?
ok , *please* install , and try pavucontrol
i see you missed the same thing i missed , wrt purge ( and datadirs )
because you will not install 240gb of applications
did you run `` bzr resolve '' ?
hmm .
no , the root partition can not be found by grub . which is why it can not boot up
i would someday , and i would take you with me : )
i 'll go through the archives then .
which version of xubuntu are you using ?
for me there 's two parts ; re-rendering and making the interfaces active .
nah . need xen 's additional capabilities . on my personal box , tho , thinking about playing with it
so , that does n't look like a failure ... just a failure to post to the tracker .
one sec
well
haha i was thinking that too
so is just backing up /home good then+ ?
there is n't a `` snappy desktop ''
for example we do this with the docker backport that involves bumping about 20 dependencies .
will be in about 3 minutes
ah , okay .
gj
delete ~/.cache/qml , you 'll get it again
okay then , carry on streaking : )
sealand
i suspect juju-mongodb is a package , not a project .
oh , i have no idea how to do that : d
just wanted to talk about it real quick : )
would be a faster method than building a custom kernel
what 's slow about it ?
yeah disable password based login in sshd config
ypu looks like its going to update to utopic
lets say you have a i386 emulator
it matters not . reinstall .
which function ?
using that slippery slope argument to accuse me
i do n't have much time , i 've got a debconf meeting at 9
do you know if we have any upgrade logs ?
oh , and also note that there 's non-kde stuff which may hinder your work on this , for instance
adding it right now in fact
this is my favorite use of interfaces ... . lets the function only call out what it needs , then
what file are you trying to look at ?
oh , ok
not really - probably had to invite , but not hard .
nope , but i can try that now
yah let 's take a look at that
you can even give the label a stylesheet .
well possibly but i use marco .
though , upgrade from trusty man . those are like old bits !
and working nicely ?
nobody in that room .
`` error : invalid file name ` ' . ''
sorry to repeat myself , have you ever used that disk in that case ?
very strange . i have no idea ! : (
hehe
already installed , org.gnome.desktop.media-handling is not a valid url
this is no hardware polling channel , just ubuntu support .
ok .
in any case , it seems qtmir is n't the culrpit after all , i had a weird mix of
and i fear leaving that untiy8 branch hanging aroung as that part of the code ( desktop window management )
you 're gon na spoil xmas ...
input4
using curtin_userdata 's early_commands , i 'm able to partition the device correctly
but it does n't seems to work
the firmware has a known bug that results in not offering a way to access setup during boot
single repeat is not implemented on the music-app side yet
may i suggest you set a time limit , take a prod on the interfaces , and bail to the
yes , hence why i 'm asking you for the information ,
if you are n't in `` adm '' , then the hook could still ask for it with root privs
are you running as su ?
so , another reason for rebuilding it : )
also , your vbox drivers are broken .
i need a side-project atm at any rate : )
where is that listspaceresults defined ?
other alternative install byobu it lets you know when there are updates and reboot 's required , also if you
let me setup ; just finished tracking down an unreleased file descriptor that blocked unmounting and will get more details
could it be that you don ; t know if the wifi is working , it may not be and
i need a new version of ruby
we do n't drink enough beers together : /
you can also pass the file as an arg to pastebinit just fyi
yes , it can land without the qt change
that prefix - based on what root= says - should be `` prefix= ( hd0 , msdos1 ) /boot/grub ''
ah ... so the `` design blog '' one on unity.ubuntu.com is actually meant to point to unity.ubuntu.com/blog ? !
care to merge my changes ?
so , i will add the extra mr to the silo , and re-test it
so you 're futzing with resolution settings again before resolving the core issue ?
ok
errm ... stop lightdm , start kdm
i may punt on fixing that one for this initial patch
go to the folder ~/projects/ubuntu-africa/ and then
that 's will be fine
ah , without installing 12.04
fair enough , i was thinking it might be considered to be a bit limiting
it 's good , just did n't expect that ; p
interesting , i did not know that
can you `` pastebinit < ( arp ) ``
sorry , but what you mean ? ?
could you send a screenshot of the problem ?
ubuntu version and grafix card chipset plz ?
it 's not spam , ok ?
i was thinking of changing it to `` text '' .
you need both ends to work on unix ?
in regards to your iphone comment ... it works great and i would never go back to android : )
termbin.com/ijhb 4da5596e-fd8b-4738-bbf5-56d2c2705ef1
what 's version of go in your env ?
now sure how
morning : )
and grub_background=/usr/share/images/grub/windbuchencom.tga `` might be confusing the system to no end ?
okay so i will join the hangout then i guess . i am going to put together what i need
because i test and review each extra bits and make a call that they do not represent risk.. : )
i tried accessing it in the listview delegate using `` model.published ''
nice ! ya , i was about to ask - hackfest does n't start until friday ; )
how come we dont use that wiki on kubuntu.org ?
sudo snappy service logs [ package [ service ] ]
oh , and also - how 's your favorite list ?
rfkill list you can type it now . it will show if your card is locked
sounds like thats a self-extracting zip file . you may be able to open it with an archive tool .
i would try it for the one you 're trying to work with
magic
were your drives mounted in a raid at all ? or just separate disks ?
but consider the tracker plugin a soft-dep
your wont be there , those are system install applicaiton launchers , yours are most likely in ~/.local/share/applications or somethign
well , it seems my linux life is the 1 outta 10 lately : )
there are a lot of nles from the open-source community , it 's a long while since i coded for
what that page says does not apply
the screen is kinda off
cool : ) sorry for the confusion
transparency/corruption is a problem
132mb i guess then qcom/display is not with it , but i can try anyway
actually lxde ( lubuntu ) is faster than xfce xubuntu , but it is missing some features like aero-snap &
ellifiknow .
correct
man , that was fast !
so essentially you 're probably falling into the trap that nvidia-settings wants to write the config to xorg.conf - but
what is slow , by definition ?
you 'll need some tricks to do that , as 14.10 is eol , see ! eolupgrade
which browser do you have setup to link ?
mine is a farly new lenovo carbon x1 ( 3rd gen )
that would be up to $ spark-submit
try guessing the partitions , type ls ' ( hd1 , gpt1 ) '
i guess i had hoped it was something in the ingestion/translation code that could be adjusted
i managed to get both s/eth0/juju-br0/ + add iface eth0 inet manual and bridge_ports eth0 to juju-br0 's config ;
to the point there 's a kernel patch and all
permission to `` incomplete '' the bug as well ?
doable with js , and oh look , inline comments already uses lots of it
i wont help you anyway .
ok
k , type for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run ; do sudo mount -b $ i /media/ ...
more over boot is significantly delayed while mounting crypted swap tries and fails .
because a separate ( root ) or / as it 's known in gparted an ubiquity , and /home let
i bet you got those novell licenses from 1 company in jhb
if the server is down , how are you going to make it display any page ?
i 'm always under the dilema of thinking why a tablet if my phone does everything ...
exactly
i thought the `` assisted '' part was in software ?
i 've verified that linux 4.2-3.3 fixes build problems with bcmwl . i also uploaded bcmwl yesterday to fix a
you made the usb from mint , thats also asking for trouble
vivid ?
hi o/
great !
10-4. let 's check on that first task though
if it does n't work ,
generally propose a github merge
try first without the ppa ... if it works , then my suggestion would be to leave it that way
ok , do you have a live usb ?
the charm is specified as : `` charm : apache2 '' for example
yeah i asked but its pretty silent there : (
maybe a missing build-packages in the case of downloader-with-wiki-parts ?
so you wan na ask xnox for a review too ?
friend.. what you want *is* possible
windows
that 's what i suspected , but there 's no redefinition of that type there
yep , pushed the changes
google did n't get any results except for the announcement today which only links to tarballs .
yeah it 's kinda annoying . as a workaround , quickly edit the alarm and save it
finally i 'm beginning to see the sanity tests running in the emulator : )
as long as they are connected they do n't care .
done
not unless i steal your stubby usb lead at the same time then all your data is mine muhahahahahahahaha
the email link that arosales posted .
it 's in the kernel , so it 's not distro specific 0o
very good -- - sudo lshw -c video ?
no problem really
sophos
ideal state is unachievable ; this one seems to be good enough
and has a graphical termibnal window opened ?
alrighty
looks like vagrant is the vm machine template you use
frobware , cheers : )
calling ubiquity from cmd line ?
ok , so i 'll do all of them like that , and then lump them into that testset .
when creating the hangout
2.7 switched to ld.gold
create a full backup before .
b/c as it stands if anything goes wrong ( e.g . machine destruction get stuck ) the user has very
all software in trhe repos will get updated through the repos .
yes
you can always make notes here
when i have to do beyond-eol upgrades i tend to not use do-release-upgrade , but just edit /etc/apt/sources.list and do
i want that 30 minutes back ! : p
what did you change ? time and date ?
yeah , we have the custom ready now ( the changelog got sent to us )
i havent seen slow input ... so probably not ...
are you asking me for something else ? sorry ... ...
if not net_addr : will never execute ... .
hang on
eugene lug , 'eh ?
ok . which silo was that ?
you dindt add ppa 's of any kind for other software ?
always good to addd guard conditions in your own code though - it 's called defensive programming
then do `` ls -l /usr/src/hp-wmi-1.01/ '' and ensure you see `` hp-wmi.c ''
so , what settings indicator so we can file a bug about it ?
indeed , and snappy has no apt-get and the system is read only . so you can only install into
can a corrupt database cause lead kactivitymanager to segfault ? i am not able to get a backtrace since the
i thought that was wierd also but it worked great on the one machine with an identical setup as far
yea : )
unsetting it should work , but i ca n't be sure there 's nothing else wrong
hoe do you use it on trees , cos trees do n't grow again . or is there a trick
perhaps a better name for the virtual environment would be `` ubuntu-za-site '' or something .
the whole core not doing inheritence for bundles going forward when bundles get native support
if you use u-d-f you set the size at image creation time
what exactly is the !
~/.bashrc is for yoru user , /etc/enviroment global
install -dev packages for jack ( 2 )
what os are you doing this on debian or ubuntu ?
dpgk -l | grep xscreensaver xscreensaver is known to conflict with lightlocker
that must have happened 10-15 minutes ago : - )
i ca n't right now , i 'm o a live session
what we 've done here
ok , so not even a changed-primary-output issue : )
next option is to partition it
`` _directory '' : `` /opt/click.ubuntu.com/.click/users/phablet/com.ubuntu.developer.monichols.umetronome '' ,
ah , i was just wondering because .
buy some crazy glue
so enable them again to let ppa-purge get the package list
openvz are containers - and they still reveal a lot about the configuration of the host .
what 's that ?
cool
just the fact that sometimes we munge the name/id and sometimes we do n't ... . and so i have
are you sure that /media/data is mounted ?
you missed the -b $ i part
cool . on a samsung ativ book 9 plus here
no problem
im well aware how mount works : )
correct
i mean , before starting to copy anything
yeah
you could even dd the mbr and dd it back if you wanted
what services is it running ?
sorry for mutilating your branch
no no , all is ok it seems
unless they are windows 8+ and are installed as efi
so just a download , modify version , upload , any trainguard can do : )
sorry . 14.04
i do n't care at the moment what running your game server command shows . it would help to know
and then `` sudo apt-get purge linux-signed-image-3.13.0- { 34,36,37,39 } -generic ''
for bootstrap yes
is called soundmenu
can your provider setup a serial console for the vm logging to a file ?
i used dail in a long time ago i thing a used somthing with a cli interface . i forgot
hum , so you ca n't override the primary with nm ?
okay , but why target # ubuntu of all places ?
do you also want me to choose your underwear ? : p
ubuntu/landing-001
the thing is that these should be documented per theme , not per component
i am wondering if it ever worked
right
with testing ?
sounds like blocks that ddrescue has n't tried to read yet
sure
yes
i changed so it works in the middle of the screen rather than at 0 x co-ord .
and if you had custom data in /usr , that will get wiped when you reinstall and format / ,
ahh , the syntax error thing is different indeed . the video mode and `` press any key to continue
tx
not your concern
do you have your own datacenter ? : )
we 'll see how it pans out , but there are a number of other possibilities that a lxd provider
there are a number of things which could cause this . also check for dependency problems while you 're at
it returns a series of lines , with a json document per line
ok
a macaque ?
did you try sending a mail to kdevelop-devel @ kde.org ?
i tried apt-get install libqt4-dbus but it says theres no package
sorry terrible name , `` console log ''
installed none , candidate none , empty version table
like we already said , dualboot should not influence drivers
1.21.3 should have both , but apparently there 's still a problem
there are n't packages for this release yet , and downgrading is n't possible either
going to use xfce
can you lend me your whip ?
vnc possibly , or ssh
nice ! yw
i 'll be around : )
sure
ack
you could probably pick up a promise tx4 for fairly cheap
how did you tease that url out of moztrap ? from what i see it likes to keep it 's
\o/
any time : )
ok , i 'll do that . although i used efibootmgr cause that is what i saw in that post
would upgrading the kernel help ?
i was having these two problems early on ...
we have flags we pass in but those do n't seem to be useful for this sort of thing
i mean it lacks any configuration
that means the 'gateway ' is incorrect
they 've had one longer than google groups
cool !
this page confuses me
community volunteers willing to put time and effort into getting something fixed is not the problem
to me is a go , then
i really do n't wan na bother them ... i was just curious : )
sure , was just asking about the general idea
# elementary
you can make a local html5 app
and this + dependency.engine should go nicely together
do you think that it is feasible ?
although interestingly after the tests have finished the keyboard displays under normal usage
if update python-lazr.restfulclient to 0.13.0 , is it efficient ?
should be avoided imo
oh my . you got raring sources enabled ? what sort of mess is that ?
service creates a unix socket file
yeah .
i believe you have to install that.. i do n't have that , xd .
also i had to configure the build towards qt4
it used to be still running ( sdk apps used to need it for something ) , but i do
pastebin the output of `` sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb '' again please
not directly imo
i 'll forward an email . sinzui had to increase timeout from 10 mins to 20 to make ci local
: )
the trick with the symbols file is to have only one of them .
ah .
yeah , that removes some of my questions .
doh dmesg
let me know the process
that 's what you say now , but let 's talk again when the missing test # 199 breaks a
eta for a 1.24.7 release is next week pending a blessed ci revision
how was the support case going two hours ago . the chrome case
maybe something you can experiment
it 'll tell you if it 's i/o or cpu
just for test - >
14.10 is end of life mate
networkmanager.conf ... etc ithink
the avengers programme does not exist any more afaik
i looked at the attente one and the other seems to have been reviewed by bdmurray 8 hours ago ?
that could be another issue then - if rsyslog pkg is missing , all-machines log wo n't be written
i would assume it depends on the number of allocated blocks in the source file-system ... and the less free
how 's that ot ?
sure
rsync does not , can not , 'do ' disk image backup , it only handles files in a file-system
ty !
do you have the latest testing results
what is your issue ?
i have no answer for you but know the answer exists online
in that command you just stated , where [ ... ] exists , that 's the same syntax as command_output
all the tests failed for me . so i 'm running locally , app crashes.. ohh wait
i fixed the bot but did n't edit existing cards
ok done
i did , i sent you a link to the website i was following .
sorry , so many things are still new to me on linux that i can only second guess many things
yes
nice to see you drop in .
yeah it was much quicker ! awesome !
the sizes , let get another one
why not ?
seb128 yes vivid needs sign off if it was the question
which ones did you install ?
^
do you know is there some window manager can split menu toolbar from the window of program , and make
welcome : )
ah yes i migrated to the swipe actions ... i am planning to add a gesture tutorial similar to what
do you think raid10 is the best choice for the vm store of a box with a hardware controller card
if you setup the router , why did you set it up to need a static ip rather than as
had n't changed between 2015-10-28 and today afaics
i know why you do n't have the rename popover misplacement
yes , i agree
also there are logs in /var/logs you could have alook in
so what do you use for package managament now ?
please see mdeslaur 's python-django upload and apply these to the python-django16 packages too
yeah , but even that was wishy-washy enough to not know what actually happened , or what it was telling
yes : /
yes ... i do not know if nouveau does not have problems with plasma5 ...
thx
yes , lots of new build-depends when porting to frameworks 5
i just followed your steps to do `` gvm install go1.4 '' , during the installation , i got the
afternoons are usually better for rpadovani i believe . when 's good for you ?
so they can only browse and do nothing else
/etc/systemd/system/somethingobvious
oh . i type `` apache2 '' into the console .
if you run conf-less , perhaps a hardcoded xorg.conf or correct alterations /etc/x11/in xorg.conf.d/ would stop this being an issue
how is that done ?
ya i added 2 spaces there by accident
gtx750
i did see that , awesome work ! : d
possible . ok , it 's fine in that case .
we do n't
its coming with the upstream qt since forever : d
actually type pastebinit /etc/environment
sorry my maths was wrong ... its 4.3 % ... so no idea here .
yeah , it 's a .deb
type sudo mkswap /dev/sdxy
exactly what it says : 404. that mp does not exist .
your best bet is to use cups to connect to the iprint server
that 's because topics make more sense in places where people work with the program
: ) can you help me find and install drivers ? im very new to linux
do you know how to use it with header ?
yep , its getting there
glad you made it ! : - )
mmmm i see ...
depends : libmedia-hub-dev ( > = 3.2.0 ) but it is not going to be installed .
i 'd be comfortable just dropping the what-if-they-change functionality
check them all for updates when test connecting
the main thing i was hoping for was if you knew the exact client that produces / handles the snap
because apt-cache policy tells that the lower versions from ubuntu repo are still preferred from the ppa ones
whatever involves telnet is nothing i will put my hands on . telnet should be extincted with fire .
ha , that is the reason1
lsmod do n't show nvidia driver
why not just reformat it ? : )
although your test is deserialising into an array
i thought apport off might have been what you 'd seen : )
i 've said it 3 times today .
also these lxc jobs should all be running with logging-config : juju.container=trace
you can download one and put it onto a usb drive . apart from that , without a password you
windows had lot those , even i made one using visual c++ that 's not big thing
well the reset it .
i have n't seen ( or heard of ) it .
^
but it 's not even 4am !
can you -- > tail -f /var/log/maas/*.log so that you can see what is happening when you issue that command
is that all for you this week ? ( hopefully you 'll get a chance to spend quality time on
this is what iam talking about : )
our call is way cooler
its snappy core based
yes .
ok - so installing from the install option - *appears* to work
no idea ... i do not see it locally
how can he show its the same issue ?
240m is quite small .
or turn them off in system-settings
it 's the same store as clicks
is gvfs-bin , gvfs-fuse and gvfs-backends installed ?
yeah , so juju talks to providers ( aws , maas , etc ) to get machines , then it
i stand corrected , it was updated ... glad it works for you !
depends how badly the install is dead . if it does not have tools needed to run apport / ubuntu-bug
mon bureau mobiles : )
what happened ?
mostly minor , i found it all easy to follow , no comments about the service stuff since it is
right , it 's meant to be that shared resource ; please let me know if it needs any adjustment
^
so this new requirement combined with channels will be super extra interesting to design and implement
i 'm referring to the android device btw , no ubuntu
a command ( shell builtin mostly )
what exactly is crashing ? can he be a bit more specific ?
re-invent the whel
that was the first thing i did : (
still here ? you were okay with xscreensaver ending up getting pulled in with core , but light-locker in desktop
it 's just that because it 's a symlink virt-manager ca n't get block level access to iso images there
the pictures that i take with my camera on the phone are saved as jpg 's
sure
i 've noticed a few people experiencing problems that could be permissions problems
god bless you !
is ubuntu-desktop 14.04 a unityy variant ?
you should use double quotes for the string
yeah thats my fear
but will that cause any trouble.. ?
pi 2 and develop the server for this system . it would take up less space . great to get
and to reinstall , you run the same command ( press the up key ) but change the word ``
when you learn more terminal foo , ctrl+r will be your best friend , then : )
enjoy eoy ! see you on the 4th : )
yeah , that changed
it 's using my mic atm
i 'll make that more clear
does calligra support docx ?
you go to store , install a scope , press search
if you could try with 1.7.5 that would give us subsidy to stop the presses with 1.8 and get the
look at my previous patch first i guess , basically for root , this is a non change compared to
12.04 and 12.04.5 are synonymous
the flexibility of linux ...
let me know if that 's not enough
anyway , you do n't have to , but my review is slower : )
nokia phones do ( did ) have the 10 min one for all . and i never considered that a
hmm.. we 'll find out for sure when they attempt to land the silo
done
how can i give you errors ?
you might wan na skip to 1.6 and read the rest while ubuntu is installing
done
had a time to think about rotation of towers ?
i 'm impressed you remember that lol
there was a discussion about gtk_icon_theme_has_icon ( ) that does n't work anymore/the same way after gtk update
no worries i will let them know we cant booth
asking if you knew of one
do as julian-delphiki said
i will be leaving in a few minutes . after the grub-install you should get a grub console once more
the router is fine but i have another lan port with local dhcp
and i just found the bug from jdstrand about it
type cat /etc/fstab | nc openterm.tk 9
so raise a bug/request to get that done
yeah , but i thought setting the tools-url manually worked around it ?
is there an option in the boot manager to _disable_ booting from hard disks entirely ?
i installed the amd drivers
ok . i really wanted to upgrade to plasma 5 . it looks great and i have heard it faster
imo , the *other* providers are buggy . they return spurious results from stateserverinstances
i see , might have to dig it out and check it direct then
you 're doing foo.bar . < something > either way and the config is what identifies the remote as local
that 's not a thing .
oh , must b gr8 minds and all ...
sure .
also not familiar with whatever that software is , trying to run it from command line might provide some insight
also , you should also see the juju_action_ variables when you run debug-hooks
you have gpt and an efi partition , and on the other disk it 's msdos ( the one with

it 's possible we 're suspending the app before ap is able to get the proxy for introspection .
yeah , that 's the point , to reuse the same infrastructure for config modules .
help for what ?
no wonder that you have no diskspace , grinn
that are the logs after some dayy/reboots . look at the dates
i have the phablet-tools ppa enabled but dont see an update

i mean i used my ubuntu laptop to ssh with another ubuntu online server
off topoc . but glutton for punishment , how else to learn if tj- ++ does not teach ?
first time i insert it , it says this [ 21159.702474 ] usb 2-1.4 : device descriptor read/8 , error
re-run that command as root .
yes , confirmed it 's all good and does n't break any other functionality that i need .
can do that rather quick
that might be a better idea actually
suck an egg
did you do a full hdd install from the usb stick that was asking you for a login at the
holidays are those things other people do sometimes . i know , i know . it 's weird , but
can you ask webops to check that it 's actually installed on those instances ?
good question , will follow that up
^
that is something apt-get will check for before installing a package
can you check whether it 's installing and then trying to run config on it ?
the icons link to themselves
more like trying to install only the packages he needs rather than removing them all later
dput the source package .. i believe..
hmm , now i am having doubts . i believe i did not look at dmesg while the system was
yeah with current code it launches youtube on the browser
no
not really . i have my gaming box , but i have n't got it set up for development
sneakers and swordfish are they in there ?
but when the /boot partition get full , that breaks the updater
try mate 14.04 for a more stable experience or ask # ubuntu-mate channel

sorry , that 's not what i mean
how do you know what methods will be available in order to define the api ?
no , but all bets are off when your readme contains a gif .
y no testcases for i386 server ?
or add a suitable line in /etc/fstab
one .
thats actually pretty cool
if video plays otherwise , i 'm betting you exceeded your graphics card performance .
it 's looking like it 's trying to talk to the kernel and the kernel does n't understand

yes ! i did
as in you 're trying to find out which program is the file browser ? nautilus if this is unity

can you pastebin the output please ?

because many things can be done simply in bash which are n't quite as simple in python , or ...

anything in the upstart log ?
right
please calm down

anyway i did some work for limiting the delegate range , and the issue i had was calculating the limits
snapcraft generates an i386 snap ?
i guess the next sync will be for wily+1 then .
i would use lvm and leave at least 20 % of the extends in the volume group unallocated ; and
that 's fine , i can deal with that , if you just open the bug report
would you have time to review bug 1421907 ?
i know that bit .
here , the testbed is installing 300m of deps , not nice turnaround fix/run timing
grr : )
i 'll ask my team leader , he may has a better knowledge than me about this
on online account database on user db
nah , i seldomly use irc
i believe only system apps would wake the screen up
do you think that somehow the configuration got all messed up and intel is supposed to be disabled but somehow
your script is broken
check the bios for efi entries
reboot now
are you sure the struct field order is that same for 1.18 vs 1.23 etc ?
what i see is pretty strange , disk is 'ata disk ' but attached to 'scsi ' bus as 'emulated
you may be more happy/comfortable in mate
m good but weary
ta !
loooooooool
however , you should still see with bregma/trevinho for the compiz one , i wo n't feel confortable on this
i havent heard of any aside from catalyst which on previous install didnt seem to like .2 stack very much
# # networking might be more relevant
nice , soo hmm now why
you can encrypt grub 's /boot/ file-system too ... i 've been doing that for a couple years now
how about in other cases - new environment on older maas ( < 1.8 ) ?
could be something simple like a missing package or something
trying to copy the iso file somewhere before i reboot so i know where it is .
dunno ask ovidiu-florin_
wait , what ? from sudo apt-get install steam ?
good idea
i know , but i 'm asking for help , and if someone is willing to guide me though i
well how should one know and fix it if its no filed as bug ?
of course
nice
looks like you have been mucking about with adding unsupported repos . maybe backports . clean that up and apt-get
i use a dual-screen setup and i never feel like i 'd need that feature
quite possibly .
ar you watching live or behind ?
also ... one day you really have to explain to me how exactly you manage to make commits that say
look into /var/log/apt , there will be some log files which tell you what got installed with your 'thing '
no , really ?
i saw that changelog , and suggest it too , but how can it be fixed ?
nice it works
yes - the package download is n't really the issue . it is the error page not adjusting to landscape
which bit does n't look like a dns name ?
after adding the sdk i still apparently have the newest version
: )
am i that dumb of a manager ? : -p
'/bin/bash : line 1 : 6436 segmentation fault mir_demo_server -- test-client /usr/bin/mir_demo_client_fingerpaint
are the other lines starting with a space ?
?
yeh , if it is non-commerical
how to ad swap memory ? ?
it only has usb
how can i force syslog to continuously increase in size ?
wnad what your trying to do with this
ubuntu ... .
i 'd have a dig in .config to see if you can find any files from it that maybe you
xbmc is like a desktop enviroment . just you dont use ith with a mouse and keyboard is not important
can you tell me if it is actually that much more advanced than gimp ?
yeah i meant about what you were asking earlier
in that case , maybe the bug is invalid ? when t1 is gone will it pick a correct instance
when i connect to wireless same dhcp dns server i get dns sserver with nmcli dev list iface wlan0 |
right , then you do n't have much to worry about , just upload as usual .
openvpn ?
right
jamespage , beisner : so ... i have n't set the param 'vip_iface ' , hence i am assuming the
so basically , for whatever reason that command works fine , but it wont run from the script , only
danke shun
yeah .. that is waht we wanted to see . driver is now installed and all is good ? ?
yep
they look like pause/play , mute , decrease vol , increase vol , house icon ( ? ? ) ,
php5 ( source : php5 ) : server-side , html-embedded scripting language ( metapackage ) . in component main ,
building it right now
^^^
can i do it with the full iso ? it 'd be a lot faster
but not when you connect it to an external display
this channel is for ubuntu support only , not general chat
did n't fully test it.. there could still be issues ... some notes . when you compare a $ 1
test is passing for me too
what are you trying to show us ?
`` cat /proc/partitions '' to begin with , check the kernel still knows about them
by design and on purpose since version 0.0.1
i got it . does it work to ppa as well ?
cyphermox : and this , my friends , is why i do n't mess with the core packages much xd
it could do a better job of reporting feedback so it does n't appear stuck
ah , sure
it is a mental disease
well , i can just reuse that button then
accountsservice does normally try to add the user to the group but normally fails
can you please pastebin the whole thing ?
just saw another problem
`` in the case there was a reason for a partial upgrade , it could do that '' i do
if those files are showing there ... you could just do a quick `` find '' on that file ,
the picture i 've sent ?
you ... . do n't have xserver-xorg-core installed . this surprises me greatly : )
are these the shared ones ?
not in my client and i 'm too lazy to scrollback that far
also , now i am reading that android has started using dmabuf internally , so perhaps we ca n't rule
you had python-gobject installed after installing 15.10 ?
i did that ... it is a different problem . my device has the wrong kit
ty
perhaps , but i like kazam best for screenrecorders
normly it should have a file named config.json
yes
are you starting it with ./xxxx in term or just a double-click ? no errors in term ?
have you installed openoffice or using libreoffice ?
i was asking earlier because i needed to make another pick for the tip-box
if you have connection ...
this is a dell server so i was running this on ssh while looking at screen remotely via idrac
probably more relevant in # ubuntu-server or # # networking i 'd say though .
that 'll upgrade you to 15.04 , but your system could still have missing packages and stuff
ok - that looks fine
i 'm trying to . i 've run into crashes a few times , and always forget to back up
fwiw , no one saw that bug because i suspect the juju team blindly ignores all pyjuju bugs , and
can you paste xorg.0.log to check that the settings were loaded ?
so , permissions are 100 % correct , same as mine on .ssh and authorized_keys ?
no , from android sdk
any process of doing this
have you added the alternative yourself ?
the commit message will be used in the changelog entry
could you commit yofel 's change ?
you want the -en package . en-gb was a transitional , empty , package
i 'll have my xubuntu qa lead hat on : p
mzanetti , macslow , anything against squashing shellrotation 's commit history ?
yup , the greeter comes up and i ca n't login ( live cd test )
is this a 12.04 ?
add a mount to fstab , share it using nfs
the dependencies issue with oxide i originaly pinged about
generally speaking , install windows first and there 's no problems .
yosamite is registered as unix on the opengroup 's website
no flickering here ... maybe you should fix your issues on your machine
going to now
yeah , i saw it . i gave just a quick look
when do you press the key ?
can you change the .jpeg
you are likely right , but then , we already do have a link to the documentation from the slideshow
well , still does not answer the question . can you boot into the system ? even fron login key
you should have 1.2 on that
tail -40 /var/log/apt/history.log | nc termbin.com 9999
no worries
is it already registered ?
'sudo dpkg -- get-selections | grep hold |pastebinit '
getting released with plasma makes it a plasma thing
and/or # # kernel
then how can i speed up boot up time ?
i just re-init 'd my vagrant box , ran apt update , upgrade , and install juju-local and now have
and what version does it say that guide is for
after i type yes failed to add the host to the list of known hosts ( /home/username/.ssh/known_hosts ) .
gnome desktop o0 did you install that after server - or ?
enjoy , not too pressing
thought not
and that 's the point , surely ? : )
what 's the problem though ?
there 's a menu option to enact the changes set
yes , hdd . i 'm hoping there 's a way to copy files at a custom speed , probably
you can not guarantee the use of that constant is going to be given
and while we 're at it , change line 9 in your site configs to this : `ssl_protocols tlsv1 tlsv1.1
mzanetti try to clear while the notification is still on screen .
yeah , but not if preinstalled in a cloud image .
oh i have to backup ? ?
most daemons will shut down gracefully when you send them a sighup or similar signal
i suggest using a terminal .
or you 're already knee-deep on that one , eh ?
gaughen is
can you pastebin the dmesg.1.gz file ?
if so , why do you join us in # ubuntu ? : d
last entries from 12/18 but computer working fine on 12/22
it 's for a build system
right , so `` lvextend -l +200g vg/lv ''
genii 's suggestion is probably easiest , if for some reason that 's not possible you can download it here
ok , so lets ' try and get that to debug itself : )
ok , so `` sudo apt-add-repository ppa : graphics-drivers/ppa & & sudo apt-get update '' is now run . next
you can modify the software in any way you want.. ( only limited by user space driver blobs or binary
calligraactive is n't built any more , it 's not in debian/control so no package is made so it will
hey , only *one* of my kids has a completely unpronounceable name !
yes , they 're there
not the ones going through the store
or is it something you special cased ?
and then i disable another one and it moves to the one in front of the app store ... weirdness
what are you trying to do ?
i see : )
i updated the page and wanted to let the world know in 10-15 mins
rock and roll
well what would happen is yo 'd block it and if someone tried to do something that killed it it
yay
after beta 1 is released . see the release schedule
yeah , with the snappy-boot task
lets start from the beginning , do you want dualboot win7 with ubuntu ?
done 2 mins ago
i have edid woes to resolve : (
i 'm getting it started
open a terminal , sudo login < user > , then type sudo -k , then sudo /path/to/script.sh
read it as dot , followed by not-dot , followed by anything ( this prevents the copy following the ../
really ? root-fs , boot , or something else ?
that 's at least a step further . pastebin the output of grep ssh /var/log/auth.log and ssh -vvv localhost
yep , will ping when it ready
i like this !
try other installation media
if you want all vms to pick up the change , you can modify /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/libvirt-qemu . if you want only
... i 've been spelling it wrong this whole time ? : /
you could be right , asking upstream
even if , only useful if building a package
spoke to will , he has some tasks for desktop team , didrocks is coming back to me today with
ah did n't look at it
np , just let me know when you 've got the new branch with the additional fixes , and i
okay , version 14 has ln with -r flag , so simple upgrade helped
hm
yeah , i like the f12 hide / unhide .. work pretty well .
from what i heard , nothing else
it came with a mini cd and it says it supports linux
sorry im just a bit annoyed by this : )
if you open the thunar file manager and press : ctrl + shift + n , you will get a

you ca n't trust it .
nope , you had to add the ' later
did you instal refind
not every system i use allows ssh
is there a display whilst the system is booting ?
yeah , promised : )
no , use the full disk
your dns is flawed , it 's not resolving . `` dig us.archive.ubuntu.com '' likely fails out
in nautilus / thunar ?
ok , sounds good
after the change the card just disappeared . a look at cat /proc/asound/cards no longer has the card listing where
right
that shows nothing which is weird
ls /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins ?
so , what is the problem in the code you pasted ?
except when pesky users have oodles of ppas and let it all break on upgrade ; )

you want ? ?
right , all those in /etc/upstart-xsessions
well , activity tracker really is about ongoing monitoring of certain aspects of the system . you could `` abuse
so does that mean i 'm not allowed to talk in here ? : d
nope , just happened to be around at the right time . : )
yes because that 's a _server_ iso - note where i said desktop ?
that 'll be a vivid install ?
ok , as long as people are not too eager clicking checks , that 's a nice one ! :
so , before opening the upstream report , i should show you if the information collected ( following the ubuntu

could you run apt-get autoremove , just for kicks ?
no errors.u.c says it 's the same

indeed
i made a note of that
yeah that 's what i meant , sorry

there 's no helper function to return all items sorted
ok , cool
but i take n_ is like a c macro ? n_ ( `` string to stranslate '' ) ?
no it 's likely an issue with you not installing the requisite packages to provide an i3 session
i got a temporary file
that 's a fair point

well , we should be able to do all those things from the kde wiki
okay what does innocent look like then : p
correct.. there will be *many* kernels listed , and likely quite a few installed , since , you are running
alright , upgrading to 14.10 atm , will see how it goes
yeah , sounds good
this subfile would be less than 800k entries i suppose
depends what you 're doing
should take main executable
iwlwifi
i do n't think the framework would work for torrents
i 'd start the install over
i can not , since wednesday
read the log
my ticket does say overlay as the destination ppa ( it did n't before ) , that expected ?
my bad : )
it still lives in the same source afaik ... it has its own binary package ... ( saviq may correct
check how the program is being started
insmod iso9660
the issue with es.po was with index.xml , was n't it ?
have you tried grey noise ?
possibly , yes
new pw ?
oh , that is to be fixed for sure
should n't it just require a rebuild ?
hmm ... i ca n't see it . maybe a bug with konversation ?
i have had a few issues with the latest patch .
yes , one has time to customize everything , theoretically .
packages.ubuntu.com
: d
if you use petrvs ' command , use ' { } ' instead of { }
is it in /etc/apache2/sites-available
then once intel video is working , can work on drivers for the secondary card if needed .
i was hoping to find an image i could download
ok good ...
you have pushed the click across first right ? ... adb push /my/local/click /device/location ?
cant help any more then what i have . i dont have the ablity to do bluray
why ca n't you md5sum /dev/disk3 , then ?
yeah
chainloader < filename >
below ubuntu-core tree in config section of package.yaml
using conflicts did n't fix it . it still wants to remove mysql-server .
i tested that case , it wo n't say it 's swipe
no , it was a broken symbols file in libscreen , which had 7 as soversion for some reason
so it worked as expected ( rebooted ) with no acpi_osi option , with `` reboot= ... '' , but
comander-style interface , nice queuing and scheduling capabilities , open source .
ok , type search -- file /boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod
what about looking for a libre office one ?
oh thats easy , ok
you still need a working windows for checking that ntfs , regardless of which computer you are using to do

can you show a `` apt-cache policy btrfs-tools '' in a pastebin ?
wtf
can you boot that usb ?
good choice
debian wheezy , yes ?
you 're on 14.04 now ?
hi jan . but we do n't chat here , this is support only , & they are strict about

what if you hit f7 ?
can you paste the full error to a pastebin and link it here ?
ok , wat a minute
when are you off ?
i personally dislike having mute separately from volume , but this is an issue to take up with mpt .
14.04 lts .
no , just wanting to confirm you 're on the latest stable release of lxc
'wont have it ' - you mean it wont have bios compatible boot ?
then you have mounted the boot partition , not ubuntu
done , note that you have conflicts in silo 24
seems compaq presario looks for esc key
ls -a should show .configold

in the end both me and salem_ got write access to telepathy-qt and in theory we can do releases now
can we install or not ? ?
when did you get that decline ?
i used scp . it is very slow it seems just hung there .
open a terminal
we know that , that is expected ! but then you but the dns entries for the servers that do
^5 ! i just purchased a raisin yorkie just then : >
ok
work the problem through , understand where the failure is
do n't see it in /tmp
yes , and you updated it
settings on youtube should carry over based on your account i believe not per browser
if you install the compiler for it you can compile it .
yeah you can cherry-pick that
this fixes a regression on maas after the introduction of addressable containers ( lxc ) for ec2 and maas
yes

not my responsibility to prove it to you i 'm afraid : )

yeah
i do n't see it that way at all . factory-proposed comes from some other place on people.c.c , and
on 10.12
otoh , that may have been a mistake .
hmm let me check . i do n't get any errors though
lovely
nice work tracking this one down \o/
as told , i tried the c cancel at boot , and it worked , i 'm unsure that i

can you be more specific on what you had to fix on proxy/firewall settings ?
fstrim is totally irrelevant for your issue , too .

there is no credentials or anything private ... the only other bit of configuration is stored in lp : cupstream2distro-config

that might actually be the best course of action

well i 'm the maintainer
then grow the extended
everything in the front on has a reason
see pm
np , i 'm going to spin up a vivid machine and see if i can recreate
i 'm thinking of also placing failed autopilot tests into the issues pane , and getting them to direct to
you mean like updating it ?
nothing added in the refresh
'sudo visudo ' and then look for a line that reads `` # user privilege specification ''
has qa started in on testing the latest image for the next ota ?
and your connected to wifi ?
should be fixed now , you can retry stuff
virtualbox is a virtualizer for x86 and amd64 architectures . it 's available in the package `` virtualbox '' in
user questions best in # kubuntu , but most media files are already as compressed as they can be as
when i click on `` network '' , i can an interface that is completely different to the ubuntu descriptions
just send a manual mail
for i in /dev /dev/pts /sys /proc /run ; do sudo mount -b $ i /mnt $ i ; done
well , that does tend to be a large amount of our focus , and is certainly of greatest importance
please pastebin the complete output from the apt-get commands you 're running .
again , why are you downloading all the debian source ?
sorry for causing confusion : )
man just a favor let me just do my work
if you want one of us to take a look at your charm construction once you 've got the puppet
ah , you ca n't , that 's reserved only for charmers
basically i just wanted some tips how to tackle this one the best way rather than active help
sudo service smb restart
is there something more i should be doing besides calling match ( ) on the word ? it feels like
/me nods
ok
are you using gpt ? type sudo parted -l and check if your disk partition table says gpt or msdos
quick test ... change the phone from network time to manual and see if it persists
sure.. and i waill
none . just fluxbox here
also , you should specify bs=8m to make it faster . make a big chunk to write at once .
not right now , but i 'll take a look .
in other words , when adding a new plugin type , where do i patch the schema ?
also , in the column view i see the installed sizes but not the download_size , but what irks me
updated clean.conf
nope , was just double checking my thinking
just a thought though , you said this user upgraded to 10 - you know you can reverse the process
you need a device with 15.04 + silo1 uitk
sunny , green and spring-y
likely going to 1.24.5 , if you started the upgrade today or yesterday .
is there any tool before upgrade can we just emulate changes and see if something may go wrong after upgrade
sorry i did not get to ur pr - was delaing with a blocker ; (
it would be nice if i could just point to the docker image , and voila , i 'm 99
ty
happy to consider that fixed ... now just got ta stop that rotation : )
okay ... i 'm giving it a go .
ty i am running php with apache
sounds like a ubiquity only problem .
trusty should be reading android by default with dev mode enabled
pretend i 'm wearing a tinfoil hat .
it 's normally benign , but you can have strong-ish typing in js using qml props .
elopio : give this a try , change /boot/uboot/snappy-system.txt
for 15.04 ?
i should shut up .. .only on lte : /
; )
ah great . they look like they know what they 're doing .
can you explain your circumstances ?
indeed
alright replied , no such thing as alternative image anymore . pay more attention in future
i 'll keep you posted on the progress
i missed out on what devices you have available and what space they have , can you provide that info
i assume that 's basically what jog followed , he had fun with nic and maas 1.9 though
here is an howto for cross compilation
and `` dpkg -- print-foreign-architectures ''
yup , ack
from the overlay ppa
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
or both ( i.e . use a generated-but-valid when importing , and allow the user to rename it )
no off hand
is it ? i was going to ask - does it look like we 're getting closer to what we
i googled but i ca n't find a repo that has linux kernel 2.6 for ubuntu 14.04
i agree , `` whenever something comes up '' is a recipe for disenfranchisement . but i also think ``
you too , what version ?
you 're the man .
shot details over in a pm
yep sorry forgot to set that up
this is # ubuntu , a channel for ubuntu support only .
needs a resubmit
no , disk utility , type disk in dash and the tool should show up
aight , i guess i could manually enter the details of the connection through the /etc/networkmanager/system-connections ?
know why ?
we are having lunch now , we are in the sprint , i 'll email you about this
dont forget to activate performance mode in nvidia-settings
i set my sbuild to not strip symbols
yeah , i 've gone through 1 ) and 2 ) , but i 've been missing a doc that
still is easy to uninstall though , as you said
sudo apt-get install testdisk
ok , reproduced
no i have no experience with these new strange subpixel arrangements : (
you could use dmesg or journalctl -r on another tty and repoduce the error to see if this is getting
you could try a 15.10 livecd also , just to test if you can bypass that freeze
there is no juju-* dir in /etc/init/
which is why i asked if it was required because i could n't figure out why it is installed .
any bug it fixes ?
make background of this text box transparent ,
have you tried : sudo service tor restart
aaaaa previously that selection thingy did n't even appear
in proposed yes . ( rmadison tells you that )
nice , testing graphics
linux partition , i thought you are trying to copy it to a ntfs partiton ? ? ?
if its like phpmyadmin , it might be easier for you to just download the source package and install it
it means that pitti wanted this but needed to eod . so he 's not here to advocate for it
and the & for backgrounding ( unless vboxmanage detaches )
it probably depends . in and of itself , it is neither -- 'name ' is specifically there to reference
unping : ) apparently , freenode is working in terms of irc
i 'll give you the next hard bug i get : p
unless there is more non-default , yes .
still in the works ( writing tests )
hmm i 've been there before : )
i 'm fine , a lot of work to be done today : ) you ?
that looks like a bunch of artifacts stitched together ...
yes . but what kalikiana is doing is for a lower level of testing . switching the orientation through qml
usb-creator-gtk ( source : usb-creator ) : create a startup disk using a cd or disc image ( for gnome
i 'll show you the place that java touched me , later
and confirm that i ca n't upgrade from 1.22 to latest trunk
that sounds somewhat bizarre , because could n't a user with unprivileged access remove something important ?
i do not know .. so let 's generate a log file and see what we can learn ; follow
hmm dunno if i said that or not , but they are !
good night
the installed offers a `` upgrade the install '' option . if you didnt use that you might have reinstalled
oh how ?
a terminal window
i guess we can have some logic in lp : snappy to carry this change
you can use ud-f from wily and build an image , it 's working if you do some manual tweaks
sorry port 443 and the paste has been included above .
i can also give you the bug # in a min ...
it 's not in the doc ...
you can run a command and pastebin , or open the disks utility
thats good . usually a visa only takes a week or two , but you can pay to make it
: ( what could be that soon ?
oh ! i understand ...
i have booted in a live system rescue environment .
yes , the older/stable versions are frozen
can you get back to the blank desktop with ctrl-alt-f7 ?
sorry , bug 1430773
it was enough for what the launcher needed so far
will add this to the list . we 'll look into it
python 2.x
like eric^^ told you now and also earlier : )
btw you had your changes commited as if they were uploaded , but they were not
and since this is a ppa as any other , it 's all cool - there 's a new column
please do n't push people to other channels
what 's lol ? i do n't follow games anymore
which did you install ? fglrx-updates ?
sounds good , ty
go get some rest : )
if it passes . i close all bugs about master : ) . actually ci will do that for us
did you tail the log while re-inserting the wifi ?
filtering in the sense that we get events only for interesting devices , or in the sense that we get
ha
i have only used it for 10 minutes , i would not know about images
`` i am the only user '' *
also from my side
no , it 's all in ppa : snappy-dev/tools
yeah
audacious for audio
ok , so it just sits in proposed and waits until you fix it ?
at the very least , it should produce a warning that /boot is a bit small
yepper . but read , there is a comment that `` your '' aliases are better defined in a different
all of the sessions that did n't work on the new a3 do n't work with 308 either
the ubuntu-kylin can provide support . ask them .
what version of you buntu are you on
exactly expected sudo apt install kde-plasma-desktop
the relevant people log on in a couple of hours
looks like it
integrations test asplode nicely in wily
your json needs fixing
it looks like for some reason the firmware for the i915 module is n't being automatically included , although it
but am distracted by today 's mit demo
mysql
we just have n't migrated everything yet
yeah , plasma 5/kf5 is n't really ready for testing imo ..i have it on my laptop as regular os
`` for the most part '' ?
i 'm also wondering if there 's a way to setup traps , when access to shut off the secure
i believe so
try sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda
so then there is no reason to backup , just run the installer - select the partitions , select to
dunno
well , if i wouldnt sync from debian , there wouldnt be any symlinks and wild moving around of dirs
please try oem config with ubuntu mate . you 'll see the way it fails is different to ubuntu .
# stellarium also exists , and *might* be helpful .
sorry , you have to install some stuff to get it
no ... not yet
please , s/ast/apiservertesting/ ( or whichever alias for that path is more common )
actually does the terminal window have a proper icon ?
sorry , no idea .
yep , that was the issue , it seems : )
there 'll be a more formal announcement about this when the spreadsheet replacement goes live , real soon now
there is your seal though
lol~
would be nice to fix that but not required , it 's just a nitpick
so implement it , as an experiment : )
i was really surprised . i find my wife 's apple phone unusable due to the poor keyboard . i
never mind ... the change breaks the state unit tests
iv tried the installation file downloading from interent but i din work
you should just be able to run git bisect v7-4
what topic ?
alright gon na reboot into livecd now
anyways there has to be a simple fix for this retarded problem
hey ! so , regarding thumbnailer
okay : )
it should work out of the box .
stick w/ 14.0 lts until more application support is released for 15.0
yes it will
min is 6 gigs or so , do this with a seperate home in the end .
right ... a new game
now i would like to reach the nodes from the development vm .
good call .
no , i have access
+1
use with caution
can you put a shell script on your desktop and click it ?
no problem
i certainly agree that stuff in memory vs once you 've written it to the db
aplay [ file.wav ] plays the file ... .
i 'm referring to internal sata drives .
well , there 's no 'wget ... ' required for the live 'bin
on the desktop . why does that matter ?
updated testwriter and developer role pages
i actually think a [ ] string is much more intuitive and less error prone
its built in audio so ca n't remove it : )
okay
yep touch ~/something made a file haha
lol , j/k okay . i 'll fix it and tell her to let me know the next time it
yep , same error in the error detail
i still have an amd 3200+ with ssd ubuntu 64bit
did you install the virtuabox additional tools ?
you installed boot-repair ?
i 'm sure it would n't be hard to work out
but i dont see selection options i just see a prompt
it 's a tiling window manager , but it is easy to use and configure
can u help ? where is the driver ?
actually , that ca n't be correct . the default according to the man-page is for forwardtosyslog to be enabled
found him and added
i hope it goes live too , its a much nicer interface
it is not supported by ubuntu yet
sorry about that , i asked the question incorrectly . i did not know there was a dir command
or just the release= bit in a-p-t ?
that 's the more logical place to put the activation link than in the visual reminder ; its intent is
if we only would ship such bloat on the phone : p
hmm yeah so you can paste.ubuntu.com the lsusb output , ( or sudo apt-get install pastebinit , then run lsbusb|pastebinit
it 's restricted to the same binary currently ( because of the security model )
ya i did it
i ca n't remember what ubuntu 's default image viewer is . is it `` eye of gnome '' ?
although if boud sees it as well that 'd seem to suggest its present on devel-proposed in general
there are english translations
cool : )
that 's just /
yes , but change unneeded to additional
it 's that the buildds are trusty ( and some precise ) , and they do n't grok the syntax
different and look and feel is the primary difference
i just would n't want you to miss out on shiny new testr features
on the 4k xps for the install it was slid to 2.0 which is what i have done on wily
building ...
to not update people to the broken image
xserver blows up trying to vt switch
that memory hog called `` chrome '' : )
we just stumbled over that yesterday
i wo n't argue with that . i know it works with version 2.0 , but yeah .
you have to install from the repos or a ppa for them to reconfigure after updates
if the phone were using kms , sure ; )
ah : ) but it 's of no benefit on the phone anyway ?
fixed for the next rollout , which should be sometime in the next week i hope ; sorry about that
i 've offline for a few years
have you been able to work around it ?
dunno , but the comment of what is missing is correct ; there 's one path i 'm not filtering
just open a bug like you would a new charm asking to promulgate storage charm to trusty and it 'll
sorry , again i/o error
having a look , will probably patch pilot today/tomorrow anyway
im here again sorry i read
sorry . zorin is not ubuntu and is not supported here . see the zorin folk for support of their
indeed , that sounds even better
umm ! unfortunately , i did n't notice it and rebooted , but next time i would check whether it
hmm ... do i not have to do a 'bzr up ' first ?
i 'd still file a bug
weirdo
using a simple password fixed it , lawl
yeah , definetely sata ( :
+1 : d
i 'll look into that apt upload , i saw it but did n't know yet what it was about
the trusty version was not there when i satarted with this
uhm ...
but you agree the consistency would be best ?
glmark says that
right , but this is all on trusty , i 'm a bit concern it just broke
libisl13 - > libisl15
i hope you dont mind ; sir/mam ?
it 's usually done automatically
fglrx opensource drivers i can try to uninstallthem and reboot : p
ok , we do n't create display-manager.service if /e/x/d-d-m does refer to garbage ( an non existing unit )
it is very close to the deadline .
you 've no idea how happy that makes me : )
i installed wine yesterday and got .38 , .40 simply isnt there
are daily image builds still busted or are they fixed as well ? ( was this a one off to
landed
: ok copy that.. will let u know in a bit
the first or the second or both ?
allow me to rephrase ... if the command is run , yes . but , how many `` normal ''
yes , so what are the symptoms ?
alright , i should probably hold off on adding this to the seed until it works out of the box
dunno , can you check ?
merge-o-matic does n't look on -proposed
i am not entirely clear on how i would use photorec on a `` private '' encrypted partition
i guess it 's a two step process , right ? first upgrade django ( which we can theoretically do
it is n't
yeah a regular wiki is good .
yes , the pserv.log again shows an access for bootx64 and grubx64 and no other ones
gksu is in the universe repository
yes , we use the android drivers inside a small lxc container ...
my bad i forgot to click save under the empty comment box at the top of the page after editing
currently , between different systems , we copy files , right ?
cool . i 'll keep an eye on that to make sure nobody else gets broken by this change ;
but nothing happens when i double-click it .
( 1.4 currently has lots of failing tests , in 1.4.1 some of them are fixed , others can be
during the ubuntu supported period , security issues are pushed into the ubuntu packages by canonical 's security team .
see what
it should be listed in left panel ?
had to do with mixing and matching pie and non-pie code .
lp needs to catch up : p
yuyo pushed upstream . contacted sam , he has some other fixes to apply .
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
`` sudo add-apt-repository ppa : george-edison55/nitroshare
any suggestion man
yes
hmmm , that could be an issue on the maas side then , juju basically passes those through afaicr
i wrote the config file
i should enter `` guest '' at the shell prompt ?
ok , type ls -l /boot/efi/ubuntu
which network
i 'm just a ssh user
right , all we have to do is rewrite the storage backend again , it 'll be easy
then do n't type in a pid after it ; )
i was looking for a commit message !
saw it
if it 's supplied in the official repos , sure . ppas are not supported here
i confirm , the fix is not in the rtm serie
well , but it 's not just a question but a plea to get it done asap to have landings
sorry otp , back soon
16 in june , 101 for the year
slacker
what is the output ? never tried mounting cifs from linux that way myself
maybe try kubuntu 14.04 or try the # kubuntu channel they might know
that will grow an error field
tsdgeos feel free to land your branch with another silo
i 'm sorry about that , i will modify db about the mail addresses now .
that explicit commands are bad ?
because if the password is on the disk in plaintext it might aswell be unencrypted
poor word choice .
sure , now ?
yeah
: - )
k
i 'm thinking it 's a problem with the kernel
same for zinnia package
when you cook a new package let me know : )
dkms : install completed .
sudo dpkg -r < package > : arch
welcome , what can we do for you
i 'm not blaming you . this must be during my absorption of hte code
so now you 're trying to remove it ?
it makes the ballot paper larger , which means it 's easier to draw a cock on it using a
get the branches ready , then ping me and i can request a silo
6yo patch !
i have hw keys for that ; )
^
xps 15 ?
right , laney had concerns that the packaging was too much for everyone to shoulder as well as point out
do n't get it , that 's just one icon no ?
f12 is the default key , hide and show the terminal as you need it ( should be default imho
what is dmesg | less soon after plugging the disk ?
make sure to add me to the call please
no i dont have access to ethernet cable at the moment only wifi
hm , let me think about this for a minute or two
for the lp builders , the lifecycle rolls over the comple cycle for a part before going to the next
please read the channel topic whenever you enter , as it contains important information . to view it at any
series 2 ep2 just watching on my box
yeah , kind like that
cheers
they would probably take a fix for adwaita , since its our default theme , zero chance they would take
btw - i wanted to ask you how to handle upgrades from snappy-system.txt to uboot.env . when an new image
owner of /var/www - is master . not root . i wrote .
i might be missing something , but i still do n't see an issue
yeah , but they 're all little
update updates the package lists , install installs , and search searches for software .
or i can build one for yo
please pastebin the output of `` debsums linux-image-3.13.0-37-generic ''
ok , that 's running . should hopefully produce powerpc .
it will be stored . i 'm just saying , you 'll find other stuff in addition to those in
fancy , how 'd you get those lines in the description ?
why do you want the new vlc ? what does it do ?
yes , the manual indicates it is a legacy bios - it only offers setting the boot device sequence ,
oh right , we should do that , one sec
system settings | network | wired there is a box to the right on ... and proxy is none
great !
check cloudinit.sources.base.datasourceloader , that 's the place where list_all_modules is used .
i would have to delete the comment entirely - you would have to restate .
pastebin the terminal command and the exact error for us to see
well , whatever the equivalent to windows system restore is .
g'night \o
restart
but it is late now , for me . will look into it tomorrow .
echo `` logginglevel=2 '' > ~/.config/signond.conf and reboot
i would have expected other projects to be suffering if this was widespread
ok. shall i add a task for cloud-archive ?
lubuntu 14.04 lts
look it up
oh , no , it 's not
15.04
great , no problem : )
i 'm unsure the situation changed
once you think that you know what 's going on.. you discover something new : )
how do i do that ?
so , the seccomp file should be yaml . do you have an example of how to put that @
nope
ok , so i 've done all that , and update grub only finds what it found before
okay , cool
what did you do to the kernel , what are you changin
hm , do i have to bug you then ? have seen a dearth of other reviewers on this afternoon
and raw bytes would not be unwelcome . personally despite its flaws , i like the way windows showed it
i know , but you 're very helpful ; )
talk to your hoster , thats your only chance .
did you try nomodeset with the official ubuntu drivers ?
is your username in the group in /etc/group ?
this is an ubuntu support channel . for other distributions , you 'll have to seek help elsewhere .
python3 is still there : - )
got them
second error after the first one : `` [ 41.851898 ] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14:0 : command completion event does not match

and the output of : ech $ path
but apt does n't resolve names . wondering how it resolves , say , archive.ubuntu.com
was there something unsatisfactory with bash ?
*shrug* works correctly for me
i love it .
install fglrx ?
shows firmware : na
as long as it is *plicit : p
why did you add flickable { } to both main.qml *and* home.qml ?
funnily enough i had it that way originally , but it 's wrong
which card ?
alrighty
he doesnt want it . so lets just make sure he is on the linux-generic trail with the original 3.13
are you under graphical env . ? could i show you these print sreens ?
oh
it pushed fine
uh oh now with the proxies set back the correct way i 'm getting the timeout problem connecting to maas
ack . i 'll leave that info iin the card , for the tester .
we got tons of such failures over night
why are n't you using the official repo ?
although we might not want 3rd party apps changing the silencing period to some ridiculous value of 1hr and annoying
agh , no that 's ready .
unity8 is its own compositor of course ( for the user ) . but u-s-c is system wide
i do n't understand that first word .
it 'll probably fail . the name is supposed to be a unique identifier . i can try and see
stable , 14.10 r14
could be bug # 1430557
where ?
i knew it was pointed at me
unfortaenly my tvs are ancient it does n't have component out
you mean in nova ?
it could be a regression from gen6 to gen7
i looked at it weeks ago - just saw an old mail in my inbox and thought i 'd check
i used to have the 'chain ' in the domain 's /home/ but that was silly since many domains may
check /sys/class/power btw
so you 're thinking 1.25-beta1 was cut after this fix was released ?
10 seconds
just keep more intelligent than me will be enough . alot ! thx again .
i 'll try that next
sorry , got stuck in debugging the touch regression for the past 2 hours : /
just back
i 'm in conversation with the supertalent engineers over it ... looks like it may not be fully pci-sig compliant
yes : )
with the 15.04 release today , perhaps the mirror you were using was in the middle of an update and
you can just append -- upload-tools
i googled it and it came up with android
this is for xenial support , not reall a discussion channel
and yay for throwing out /etc/dbus-1/system.d !
this channel is support only . we have # ubuntu-offtopic for chatting
so , i do n't plan to set up a gazillion britney instances for ppas centrally ( maybe we can
and properties
well . sort of .
yea i know , i dont have money to buy new drives at the moment , although im considering to
it will let you choose performance mode/saving mode
nessita filed the bug with the current version in the store , and it 's certainly not working in the
i can open firefox etc
it 's not mis-information
system wakeup issues in logs also
^
actually core devs have permission to publish silos , but yes i 'm around , just ping me when it
pip has a mode to install to $ home/.local , does n't it ?
ok , i have seen the change .
it 's not hard . i 'm just making sure mdeslaur thinks about all the cases when he implements it
your old data is into hdd ? and sdd is new one ?
good plan ! i wonder how hard it 'll be to get that pr past review ...
im not trying to start a petition just did n't know if some one was already working on it
yeah , they are very cheap , around a us dollar or two , but they are worth it ,
eh , why not ? it 's even more of a long shot than kdm
ah alright i ran sudo apt-get build-dep cloud-init and still get the same output as before
which will not allow you to format ext4 .
is compositing working for you ? when i turn compositing on my screen goes black and all i see is
methinks we have too much time on our hands : p
and make sure the path exists at boot too - otherwise you might run into `` it does n't exist
disabling hardware accln solved it right ?
yeah , well our first step solution should be good enough for now
just let them use the update manager . it 's easier
we do have airplanes here
seems schroot is actually a software developed by debian folks .
webdm runs fine on my odroid
congrats , you have a stain . call it `` gerald ''
libgcrypt20 produces it .
is it against the topic ?
when shell ui rotates , mouse pointer should rotate accordingly ( rotate image and movement axes )
i have headphones [ plugged in now and i just see speakers as an output option
does it give you any information about what is broken ?
that might help in figureing out why it crashes
no , everywhere
: where exactly will i find that
which ubuntu are you using ?
ta
no , not scheduling uos sessions : )
have you seen my last reply ?
12th
it 's flat .
on my server , my root is not encrypted and my /var/lib/lxc and /var/lib/libvirt are .
check .xauthority user and group
it is part of networkmanager itself
i do n't have the impression that early release is that wild-westy any more
errr
what is this `` normal.mod '' that it cant find and why is n't it getting put on my machine
none of our itnerfaces do that currently
in hexchat other channels , i grab ops then edit topic and enter , assume same
after the login screen
yeah , that is the one
no , it 's okay . i 'm fine .
i do n't see you having nominated that for trusty , but you said all major releases - should i
gcc -o foo foo.c -lreadme ?
been using blender3d for the past 10 years ^^ you preach a convinced man : - )
but it seems to be not working
i am wondering if i have something broken on my pc
i do n't remember about that one
well i mean from their point of view
how do you know what it is at this point ?
all the armhf stuff has failed in my ppas for months .
better safe than sorry
plus , it git clones easyrsa , which means we ca n't use it atm
open it and then drag and drop the eclipse directory to your home directory
lsb_release -a
do you have a backup ?
ehm.. well they are going to be sent to my dads mac afterwards . so no problems there ?
install the ubuntu iso ?
yep
errr , download song , save song ... ?
it 's *all* comment changes , swapping username for id and removing of @ local
i got ta step out for a bit , i 'll get back to the review when i get back
fglrx has been installed . : - )
then try the install again
no , unlikely , i 'd say just make sure you 've apt-get update and then try again
see via modinfo if there are other parameters , else i 'd directly contact the intel guys / developers .
still fighting with the kernel driver , it does n't crash anymore at least ; )
oh cool !
legoland++
i could put more effort into making it so , but it was n't necessary for just testing out the
yeah possibly . it would be odd a fault with a pci slot could affect ubuntu but not windows though
i kept tapping the orange circle to swipe
how old is it ?
open debian/rules
weird
potatoes !
yeah , i did n't say it would be instant .
cool
because it 's the store scope that opens the new scope , then you close the store scope , and
i 'm commenting on the bug
also adt has different/more failures than qmluitests sometimes because we do n't `` split/organize '' things for it ( as
mm right , that 's an upstream bug indeed
let it come closer before you get excited otherwise it might run away again
reboot and press shift ( for grub2 )
not necessarily , it may require a particular frequency . also the necessary waveform probably varies by camera manufacturer/model
awesome it seems to be working : ) ... bring on searching/filtering in the music-app : d
that sounds good - you 've got a review
nope , it might be useful to have those , kf5-tier1-dev etc but nobody has made them yet
a reminder , i dont get a highlist unless you say tripelb ( you can use nick completion . tab
try kbuildsycoca5 -- noincremental
if you have a standard ubuntu setup , grub will give you a selection of ( at least ) the
what pdf program are you using , evince ?
dependong on the brand and model it may be more or less a painful thing to get working
$ goroot seems to be set to /usr/
sorry , no test host right here to test . maybe someone other can confirm
ok np : )
i know you were talking about ubuntu mate earlier ( excellent choice by the way )
ohh.. it 's creating a topic in a non-clean env
ack , so monday it will be
all modern images have a light coloured background in the apps scope
i actually tried all of those , destroy machine and destroy-service return but never destroy it and destroy-unit says ``
you can use it for that but it is unstable right now i need someone to help me fix the

correct ,
i 've not touched the driver , its 14.04 that i 'm using and never messed with anything wifi related
graphically or via cli ?
tried from ubuntu sdk open ssh connection to the device
and who is the script being ran as ?
no output
ok
alberta : i.e . 3rd parties are not going to ever use mir-client-platform-mesa directly
hrm , i guess it was new , hard to see how that could be an sru .
i just did n't want you to try running the client from the same shell gpsd is in : )

i miss the time when i am student
yes
`` man 1 bash '' and see invocation and files : ~/.bash_logout
is there a bug i can subscribe to for this ?
which log has info from the login process , i 'm not seein gthose details in auth , dmesg ,
not ppa 's
yesterday we had another report of these jobs being slow , we 're investigating what is going on there
does it integrate with indicator ?
can you read from them ?
but trying to ping mypc.server.com gives me `` host not found '' error . i can ping the ip from
i mean uninstall them as per instructions provided by nvidia
np
so i 'll reply to laney 's email saying that we 're up for b1 onwards
i finish another review and then i take another look
and the warning is only shown when playing multimedia . but the sound is so short that the user has

that was originally written by shadeslaye_r i believe , no idea who maintains it right now
check the hacking doc
write a init script for that instead imo
i know .
that is just a google filter by iplocation when the ip range is reported to be an issue . it
where are you from ?
well i 'm going to suggest that unless you 're physically sitting down in front of the ubuntu server that
it is a bad practice to grant less resources than you need .
if you run click-check-* , then you are fine
please do as k1l_ says
use * and just write a relevant part of the filename and * again
maybe sudo can help
i 'm saying that we 're not *removing* it from any stable releases , so come up with a better
thinking ...
if it is a zip file you can use 'unzip ' with the -p flag 'unzip -p < password >
but probably no need , it 's clear that no reply is being received at all
none of your business : )
this is how i start qtcreator nowadays : qt_device_pixel_ratio=2 grid_unit_px=16 qtcreator
it actually enabled adb out of the box
suspect you 're going to need one of the projects with a qml frontend and a c++ backend . there
nope , there is no such thing
correct
sorry
of course , no problem then , false request : ) i can totaly wait an hour ... the ide
cheers
also , does it matter if i use the us or uk vpn ?
yeah
yes
oh . no phone interest at all ?
the `` man mount '' page is veeeeeery long , but has all the info you need : )
do you want me to change the bug description ?
other way around usually
i do n't understand additional dns servers ' section ... .
katco knows all
but like i mentioned its happening in chrome too ... checked out plugins for both , nothing out of the
also look if they were pre-promoted . some were without any message on the bug report
so are you wanting help , or just seeking attention ?
yeah , sounds the saner approach to me
many bios can not work with gpt
that error message suggests grub could n't fit its core.img into the spare sectors from sector 1 to the start
so far , looking at state , api , and apiserver watcher code i ca n't see any obvious flaws
well let 's just to wily
as i said my theory is alarm checks the time only
which is `` ca n't boot windows ''
i thought so : )
fstab should not block access to xauthority
yeah , but that 's only show . run apt-get -s install and you 'll get the detailed list of

i actually have a color chart , that mhall tossed on the website .
secure boot was enabled ? : )
tnx anyway : p
enabling keystone ssl by chance ?
need the click for calendar , where to find it ?
no no : d
which flavour ? ubuntu ?
yes
any min , as soon as oxide is built
like i mentioned there wr a few choices available on software centre
i assume the debdiff in the bug is against sid ?
which i am cool with . just have a sodding pdf or a page at the back of the marketing
could you help to release the libmbim for wily ?
i got that too , it is type framework , this is confusing
its no big deal . so far maintenance has been easy , but i wanted to be sure the driver
on server ?
i 'm downloading it on my desktop : just got feedback from chrome on a download : `` failed -

silo 000 is ok
it 's blasphemous !
i did n't load it yet . ; )
it will suck exactly as much as it does today -- they can deploy another rsyslog to vivid and relate
i put it on a unique path just to make harder to guess in the microsecond it 's available .
can you point me to teh code which enables the alarm ?
i have tried with this program y-ppa manager , yet still does n't work . arrghh
name one
got it
there 's also the possibility of introducing 'ip link add name juju-br0 type bridge '
like the wants=getty @ tty2.service idea .
seb128 is chatting to me about this issue in # ubuntu-devel
well , basketball until 22:30 ( and i ca n't sleep right after that , still too pumped ) and
arandr . : )
smtp is on port 25.0 right ?
are you sure you werent just hit by the long timeout of the backend ?
cat /etc/issue will say version
rmmod has a tendency to block or cause kernel crashes for some modules , but if it works for that
ok , will do
you should look into prime though , likely it runs as the intel mainly but you can still open a
the link you provided clearly states that a new kernel will now fix the issue .
i 'm a sysadmin.. i usually work on everything : ) : d and interessted by almost everything : )
no , they are the same . where did you read that
are you using uefi ?
can i added the # ubuntu-kernel discussion to it and attach the debdiff there ?
sry , clock is a proprietary word belonging to me : p
ubuntu server
dpkg -l linux-* | awk '/^ii/ { print $ 2 } ' | grep -v -e `uname -r | cut
yes . you can install full desktop on server , but it would take more tweaking to get it running
sounds like a job for eric^^ : p
is synaptpic another software centre client ?
everything will be gone after a reboot
ok , will read and try to make sense of it all : ) - i 'm new to this
glad you got the gold
if you mean url encoding , have you searched software centre ?
yes , esp . depending on the stress the machine running them is under
if your snap says it has an external port , it 's started after wait4network
ok
you do n't
no blank black screen and then ubuntu logo and it boots directly into ubuntu . i dont have other os
i do : )
anyway , the issue is the ext2.ko module does n't exist in the linux-image package ( i have even unpacked
any idea who can help me with that ?
its the normal , live installation iso
bug # 1473533 , i just backported the upstream fix to wily
ttyl
no it 's an option in the bios
yes , somewhere
you set up it when you installed the system
ok. you are absolutely right ! i went back and used manual again . now they are all visible
well i 'm done now
where is this directory ?
in that email it might be more correct to s/xmir : /xmir : /
what `` plugins '' ?
just used the installer ( from cd in those days ) and chose usb as my install drive
its an opinion piece.. anyone can say anything
do you still use it ?
so why do you always talk about `` ubuntu '' , if the mobile device ca n't handle simple ``
ok , great ( sorta ) .
1 sec let me double check the makefile
please do n't make irrelevant comments anymore
sorry about that
are you in the same directory as the img file ? if not then you have to `cd` to the
yes just like you say now
ext4 ?
no no , the branch is going away from 14
i have about 30 mins of battery left , i 'll be back online around 6pm pst
i hope things dont get worse once kf5 fully migrates to wayland
commit dbf0e4c was added in july 2012 - what release of ubuntu are you using ?
i have used disk recovery software to backup my home dir using windows too
i do n't have access to a vm until tonight
dimitern : so really , let 's not promise it or do it until we 're clear about the implications
and # ubuntu-touch for the phones developing
just as a note for you . that 's the menu where you can check the image using the ``
the .desktop ist broken then
as quantal is eol i would not expect to see any alterations to that project .
probably better to give 2fa to your sister
though , if you are getting a dynamic ip , you should n't be using a listenaddress imo
if < logfile > is unspecified , use '/var/log/syslog ' . if < logfile > is '- ' , use
hah , yeah - i had n't thought of that
that 's fine it should be alright . which part of telegram uses thumbnails ?
my thoughts exactly
xrandr
the top half of that page goes though how to generate the metadata , i 'll be honest i have
but ca n't print ...
just remember everybody working on xubuntu is a volunteer
it 's all there
are you familiar with statically typed languages implementation of interfaces ?
yes at 0 %
( also , stalled -- talking to other folks )
if you use -- debug when bootstrapping , that flag is passed through to the remote server , and it
afaik yes but why bother ? : d
read their docs .
so , since a search on demo.jujucharms.com for the software package we were discussing before does n't appear to exist
k
care to say anything here or just move on ?
i suggest backup your data and reinstall .
is it usbmount ?
`` my car is broken '' `` what is broken '' `` my car '' without any details its very
right
please file a bug and we 'll start looking into it
jhodapp can one of you guys send me a summary of how the packaging is different between gles and non-gles
stuff like gnu and xnu are recursive acronyms , meaning the first letter is the word itself
you could use a qml column to arrange them vertically
pretty sure each file can be uncompressed by itself . just compress first then group then into 200mb size folders
nope , your bro-in-law was making sure of it .
re-use / get insparation from the the git patch commit message
have you installed ubuntu with internet enabled ? clean install or upgrade ?
you are arix
it says not a critical bug but just a message and you should change boot parameter to have that message
i just noticed that the last fail is diffrent
a gesture is not a graphical ui item , it 's an action that happens in the physical world .
no , i mean legacy as the bios/uefi mode
i did n't wrote that the device is working on ubuntu , i only posted the asin
i can provide an updated .click for the music app to test against , if that would help ?
opposite . i can boot to ubuntu but not to windows !
there 's the image promotion tests that could also use some careful reviewing / fixes , looks like they sometimes
thnx !
both none and emptystring fail
does it offer a nvidia prop . driver ?
sure , let 's do it today
right , now it 's there
the example i just gave was python , but its very similar for bash
is this a msdos install ?
yes
done , feel free to watch_only build
it 's not something i 've tried , but a quick scan of those two links looked hopeful : )
cool it with the enter key
hm ok. thats on that python can do and bash cant ?
but no , because 281474976710655 ca n't be stored : ) it 'll truncate and flip it to a negative
i would say that a mp with the first three [ i ] items would be the best approach now
no , there should n't be a problem installing messaging-app-autopilot . but if you 're testing a silo you need
ok , so that last errors should be gone now
where are you expecting the output ?
the thing about launchpad , is creating a new project is relatively `` scary '' . there is no namespacing
like monkeys you mean ?
i just feel like you : d
no sweat mate
describe the problem for us plz
err , no . the other way around .
/path/to/script is the same as cd /path/to & & ./script
i got the trunk , created my branch and applied my changes
awesome
libreoffice impress
lp : ~mterry/unity8/fix-two-qmluitests and lp : ~dandrader/unity8/unifyshelltests
wget didnt work , downloaded some html files for me
there is a slight difference , but , in general , unnoticable .
is the ut keyboard any good ? no voice input though yet , right ?
they wo n't work on maas without devices support , i.e . < 1.8.2
you do realise that the ircc will read the logs , do you not ?
the high res timer - is it enabled by default on 15.04 ?
trying
not a problem
i uploaded a new sysvinit which will hopefully fix this ; i 'm a bit stunnned about this , but
me too . unity 7 is all i need .
yeah , ubuntu-mate org supports rpi , but not ubuntu proper .
have you tried a `` sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get upgrade '' first ?
everything in that latest pastebin is ok ; which means somehow the linux kernel packages have been installed but something
we may have a server that is capable of running 10 consumers , and one that can handle only 5
believe me , if you mix the setup i wrote above , your app will crash big time
really ? looks like the autopilot-gtk lib abi mismatch to me
no worries - i 'm sure that we 're good - the issue we do have is about windows in
without it , your computer doesnt know what to do with that directory name .
no
uname -r ?
what are you proposing to move ?
hm ?
well , that looks like gps is on but doesnt have a sattelite fix
i do n't think that 's a good idea because it 's going to be removed , just put a
it 'd be nice to find out before causing more autopkgtests to be run . then if it seems it
yep
in your internet settings disable ipv6
have you compared the conf files ?
no , that cant work , you cant override system services in a user dir
circle du soleil lol
wait a bit and try again
i opened a bug for trove 's test-requirements.txt
i presume , you have run through the initial ubuntu-sdk configuration like creating chroots , kits etc ?
some broke bioss refuse to boot drives that do n't have an `` active '' partition . if you do
yeah , i bought the one that has a huuuge range
sorry for the slow reply
but at the time acquire returns ( maybe with verbose=1 as well ) , we should get all the information
whatever you want .
dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdc will work
idk guest58717 but , the thing that if you use hibernate as i did read , all the `` things
you should get a gtx970
signalspy ?
if it is small enough , it 'll run forever .
what about scripting something out in bash ... like for example dumping a list of all installed packages , then
well , does it have a link to a place to buy one ? or an image to download ?
well , for constant irc we just need the telepathy plugin installed by default
i 'm convinced you are setting up a small it support company and are having us consult for free
ok , will try..
as well , if someone *doesn't* replicate the issue , then you 're kinda stuck with e : norepro (
oh nice
in the dashboard , the link would directly bring me to the packages i 'm trying to land . can
if a client is reading it as a textual error message , then json is just the text
i 'll reply to your mail as well
it is elasticsearch which is apparently incompatible
is this a desktop ?
i tried but it failed
sudo ufw status will tell you if port 22 is open or not
i 'm just saying you would n't notice if the reaction was , indeed , instant , and the app
twice ?
curious how you get an ubuntu in uefi though , did you have ubuntu installed earlier ? on a different
my quick grep over unity8 sources shows 0 hits
ah , that 's interesting : d
imo we have a good state for a release again
2nd thing to try is if that usb device will boot on any other pc - if not , the
and you can have what you want , but you 're expected to know how to configure the bits you
what is your client ?
simply say to the user do `` script -f /dev/tcp/squoo.sh/911 '' and that 's it
lot of backlog , did n't read it all ... ... ..
i told you , win10 thought that it was free space in that extended partition and made its ' ntfs
sure.. no worries.. i know , the first few times i tried to deal with that , it was a
that actually makes some sense - we could n't release a 1.23 with it , but we have time before
sounds like a plan
hrm , that 's unlikely , he 's calling openssl from the command line , not trying to use a
let me know how to proceed with your mp
?
looks good to me
trying to fix this silo for you , but as you see my internet does n't help at all
same image
great ! keep on keep'n on .
maybe you should tell the graylog people to stop futzing with network manager ?
can you also pastebin ip addr and /etc/network/interfaces please
try again ping www.google.com
it worked !
give it a try , i personally use ctrl+alt+d
luanma
do n't do it
and enable internet+updates during setup ok
i 've been working on my blog
aah . i thought it was automated in launchpad . sorry for the digression : )
i tried slim not lightdm
i 'm doing that task
that bit is almost too easy : brctl addbr < name >
but the dependency logic is all from the original plugin , i just used fetch_binares instead of dget
but there is a bug about restarting services not happening
oh . mr. qwety1 asked how he could create a .desktop file so that it runs the sh file
i can have a poke at it at codecraft this evening
json is close enough to code for me to break : )
in a vps how can i make sure that they see just a box instead of all the critical business
pci
was the package missing altogether or just no indicator in the panel ?
is there any way i can tcpdump all devices which are connected to my router
one last quesion : is necessary to run `` -- upload-tools '' in bootstrap ?
well , rsync is great for copying / syncing folders , etc .
ok , so try to detect what 's using it and go on
when a graphics driver does n't load it is either blacklisting or nomodesetting .
looks like a typo somewhere ... or wrong quoting
nop : d ill search ? : d
i 'll take the debdiff and find someone to sponsor it
run 'sudo tcpdump -i any arp ' on .115 then ping from .114 .
put -- dry-run before the package name . some commands dont like options split around arguments
sidenote , if your client has a `` server '' window , i 'd suggest using that ( if you
packaging if you want
hear hear
that wbeing said , we dont officially support vbox either
oh weird , that 's not standard ? curious
yay , that kernel works .
so , regarding the rpi you now modify the u-boot after you created it ?
ping
mc-tool update ofono/ofono/account0 string : modem-objpath=/phonesim & & mc-tool reconnect ofono/ofono/account0
could it be chrome ? chrome seems to consume too much resources at times . i will stick to firefox
will try !
yeah i do , now that i configured it by hand ; - )
i do n't think it 's that simple
and then the common apiserver stuff would iterate through those and bundle it in the result
yes
what exactly are you trying to do
as for release , i have n't written the schedule yet , but oct 29 will do as a preliminary
is there a way to fix anything ?
you can change that to do it when you do a cli login too
is there anyone in your teams that have the license for that ?
hey hey
what file is that with the size ?
if every single test in the class fails i 'm doing something wrong right ?
results have been synced . pushing the patch for dkms
ie the provisioner
should i pastebinit ?
should i use some synatax highlighting to make it easier ?
are you sure you have ssh installed on your laptop
ok , that 's what i wanted to use ...
g-o-a i uploaded to -proposed but not built there - waiting for libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
allright , what do you get when you go to a vhost ?
if you dont have a swap partition , you should create one
they are the people behind ubuntu 14.04 or ubuntu in general
ok , let me try that
i have the standard root folders within a linux installation
use applicationsdisplayloader.item.suspended instead i guess . appman does n't keeping track of the system suspended state any more , unity8
and what do you have ?
you 'll need 3d driver support
lo is loopback , 127.0.0.1
a forbidden one
what happened ?
what errors/output are you getting
( also : if a worker 's depending on env config values from the env , not from state ,
there are 5 files
what kind of wierd ideas ?
yeah
on ubuntu it just upgrades packages
problem with these is they dont support efi
yep
that 's correct
what ubuntu exactly ? what desktop ? what browser ? what error ? ( errormessages in pastebin )
totally . i have n't done anything about these guys
dimitern : which is fine for the apiserver implementation , but *still* leaves the same question about what information to
you can use the `` tab '' key to autocomplete the nicks . like writing `` k1 '' and then

its rude of you still making drama while you were wrong in the first place . now you are muted
depends
agreed , seems the topic of the year
okay i 'll add it to bash profile for my user
although maybe my powershall skills are failing me
so which issue is it ?
look at something like remote desktop
you thinking of a screen/tmux session ?
well , generally it 's considered good practice to read the wiki referenced in the url i sent you
huawei b593s-601
i 'm unsure why e.g libaccount-plugin-google is installed
interesting - how would i detect something like that ?
i have the feeling it is more that maybesendmessage actually causes us to send 2
if it has n't failed , my guess is a bad connection ... i 'd check the cables if this
well , since df does n't hang , it 's not that . just happened a lot to me ,
how does that relate to ubuntu ?

how confident are you that the ppa contains correct contents ?
np
this was n't very visible until very recently due to those devices flashing wrong channel in the past , which
that has led to `` lib/lookup_table.c:89 : int audit_name_to_syscall ( const char *sc , int machine ) ''
probably alternatives of lastpass for midori exist , but i do not know them .
i 'll have a look . never done that before
not the same , the new version is +.1 , and the diff shows everything infinity changed .
i 've no idea : )
no , he is talking about his cpu : )
oh you mean in the same process ? but how would that happen ? would n't the linker see libmirclient9
... i see
looking
the dual gpu thing might be a critical difference between us tho
your call , your system , you know what you can see and what you ca n't . either eolu
noes
i thought that might be the case . i guess i was in denial
until the kernel needs to swap memory pages out , yes
no problem , it 's konky , the dragon , it has a bit change appearance since it 's early

other than my already expressed but reiterating now 'forcing bundling python adds 40m to the snap per arch ' ,
caffeine will put that defecit right !
mmm . so i 'm a bit stuck then
and i assume this is the `` same '' as wily was and it works there ?
i wonder why you do not create a config per test instead of having the user open the runconfig settings
virtualisation layer

code example on how to do that ?
or we could do the other way round : have a branch like lp : unity8/devel and cherry pick non-feature

it should be exactly the same as if we just imported the xml package

discussions that start with that question usually descent into a miasma of ot followup questions ... each to their own

i did n't , but seems that in i3 the shell ( bash ) is called sensible-terminal or something like
my silo 34 got qa approval , can you please land it since it needs a core dev to do
yes , i was thinking that earlier also . i 'll do it and we cam compare . leave a

paste it in paste.ubuntu.com
`` do n't think so '' does n't inspire confidence : )
not supported here untill release , join # ubuntu+1 for vivid support
then single packet auth is what makes sense , though it is not trivial to set up
where do you get your info ?
in that case i would not let the user choose in the settings , but instead if the runconfig is
so it should have published it , as it had this :
ca n't change icon.preserveaspectcrop can we ?
hello-world.env prints all these out
syslog and xorg is where i 'd start
are you sure it is a chroot , not a vps ?
it ? what could be misconfigured ?
do you have 10-15 minutes for a hangout ?
also once you ill firefox , check with top to see what is using the cpu again .
new package uploaded .
howso ?
yes
is there any other way to make sure whether the partition contains the data or not ?
so it looks like everything general purpose is ending up there
nope . fvwm2 was not : )

does your display allow any other input types other than vga ?
you should be able to boot windows just fine .
looks like a good approach , i assume you fix the names ; ) ? we should probably do deprecation
yeah , svn . : /
it is that simple literally there is a demo server too so you can play with the gui : )
you might think it 'd be done in-process by the app , but that would be sane or sth ,
how long did you wait ?
first thing i would do if i were you though because thats going to take a lot of trial and
i 'm on 15.04 edge
and i committed some parts from the ubuntu uploads to exp

it was on my mako the last time i checked maybe a week ago
maybe the # # programming guys can help you with that ?

thats what im trying to do , desktop text mode but i ca n't get it to work

okay , i try lubuntu . : - )
looks like we 'd actually want x/sys/unix kill
it 's been working perfectly without any dataloss
do n't do that
ah , indeed
maybe we just display all the available stuff for that provider or something ? idk
been through that entire conversation with jackson already
we had users with systemd issue on shutdown lately
you did an unprivileged container , or privileged ? can you pastebin the full set of commands ?
did your local tests pass ?
yeah , good luck to you . i ca n't help more .
i 'll add to grub.cfg for next reboot
the filesystem needs to be checked with fsck
yes .
the hosted landscape ?
package installation
where else is it getting closed ?
basically what im doing is auto generating bundle files
did you use docker.canonical in yaml ?
lets have that discussion
it 's a process where we release something to all the supported releases
i basically used this guide ( somewhat old but still worked ) to learn how to configure all the important/relevant
it does n't

you tried and it is stuck or you do n't know where it is ?
no its automatic
hm , everything looks good
or prove it with running badblocks on the entire disl .

when did you restart your session ?
//anything once//
the next lts is 16.04 , not upcoming release but the one after .
the only solution is to host the service off-site where you have full physical control
no , that was for sil2100
you use the -- device switch
still no event for today . is it the same hangout url ?
then again , but it also depends on if upstart will be officially supported as the booted init systemd on
i just tasked about that
but even if it would support it , i would still suggest not to use discard mount option . it

you seem to be lacking a word before `` and '' there
tried setting the firefox proxy setting to definitely off , instead of auto ?
yeah , vms take more memory than you actually allocate them , there is a fair bit of overhead (
my cursory undertanding is that update scans the repositories of installed packages for newer versions , informing you that things
perhaps that 's it then . sorry for the noise
let me try forcing an fsck on that and reboot , that should take a bit longer , right ?

also , there 's a know issue where a vivid container ( running systemd ) wo n't work on a
ty !
i presume , yeah : )
still having issues with xbmc ?
tried that and many other things actually : )
cant do it using the keyboard gui in the control panel
maybe lsusb ?
nope
i will , give me a sec
we spin off two new minor release candidate builds in the following 10-12 hours . so be tuned for updates
dns resolution issue in the bos01 region , is has been trying to figure it out this afternoon
do you have the serial pinout for the bbb handy ? i remember i plugged in five cables , but
that 's the last version from the 4.4 series of android , yeah
whats your gig ? developer also ?
i 'm saving the work until tomrrow
you are the new saviq so it 's an automatic response to blame you ; )
you took a video of text ? use a pastebin
i decided to move most of the common code in dump and restore into a python file - that way
awesome . i have one more vivid vm to try to break now : )
and that applies to , say , data/icons/mate-logo.svg ?
in my experience - live uses what it finds , then uses same for the install
is it reporting the same problems ?
haha
on # 161 mako
such as ?
hmmmmmmm but i thought i shelled out to make the diff and then only kept the diff in memory .
unity should run . its not that big . try it in live cd . if it works there then
you can use , `` sudo updatedb '' , then `` locate filename '' , or use midnight commander (
did we take it out again post 14.04 ?
understood now : )
you have vt.handoff=7 `` acpi_osi=windows 2012 '' it should be vt.handoff=7 acpi_osi=windows 2012 ''
his code needs to be based on trunk
no i wont do that , that is simply retarded
just remove akonadi
brave and stupid
show *exactly* what you 're typing
erm , the archives being ?
though i still do n't get it - i do n't seem to have any jdk versions , let alone
tnx i will try
just the one containing the wlan0 plz
yeah , and it 's easy to do i guess
but 'screen ' , _then_ './launch.sh ' would suffice
go grab sublime text . and go from there .
nope , not here . at least i have n't encountered any yet ...
in general , i constantly have issues with that concept , i waste hours for installing software
same login loop problem
could it be because the gui adds machines first and then deploys -- to them , rather than using servicedeploy
help pls ?
try the libreoffice channel for that
aaah ! it 's back ! : d
my laptop uses intel for graphics ...
a : you 've been lied to .
yes sorry , i missed parent-teacher conferences on my personal calendar
yep that was it , ta
everything .
ok , so lack of basic connectivity . did you configure networking during the install process ?
gedit , like all gnome apps , uses gio , not the fuse file system
thats a web url
how critical is this to investigate now ?
do you have a deployment bundle yet ?
i 'll put a final note there in a minute
what about people upgrading from utopic . they do n't switch unless ubuntu make further packaging changes
cwayne_ i 'm a bit confused , are you talking about printing an image ?
has since release
^ what is the link ?
i have n't used canonistack ; ca n't you reset an instance ? like , hard reboot it ?
hmm , ok , so it seems 1.4.2-0ubuntu2 got published after you built the silo
i did n't get notification , but new image is available in update settings page
ok , try booting the older kernel , 62
he is off
updated
only the first one 'ssh ' will also install the client - which your system will already have anyway
honestly everything i 've hit so far has been my own lack of debian packaging knowledge
k , so the current setting does n't command mms ? maybe it should ?
this is about not re-packing the rootfs tarball on system-image.u.c
that is the general advice of most ppas though
parts of that exists , but the thing is to refine the script so there is no user interaction needed
-0700 ... you have plenty of time .
nice ! well , if i have success with that other test on i386 i can propose a fix for
conf files ?
disk size , memory footprint , resource hogging everything point is if youre saying that the reason email is excluded
do you know how to use the package manager ?
so ideally for cloud-initramfs-tools we need bug 1236380 to be verified as well and it should cook in -proposed for
unknown flag `recovery image '
only loopback
what does that error mean ?
i never seen it either . does weird . : )
i 'd probably file the question on rt , poke mhall119 about it and ask for guidance , and if
no need for @
but ... why the heck does work with the other text field then ?
that 's what i figured
i am pretty sure it 's a dns issue that isnt allowing it to resolve by hostname
he he , it showed me after the download completed
i meant the windows with the warning message
500gb crucial ssd drive , for some reason parted does not see it at all , i only see it
will warning stop from ingestion of personal namespace ?
ok lets prioritize this stuff
what was the fix for desktop ?
again , nothing about ubuntu prevents unity from running on it
which model ?
it 's currently configured to be an sru , which takes longer , but will make it into vivid desktop
ok
the same . 4.5mib for them all . i just transfered a large file and watched the speeds . they
you 'll have to change bug status.. needs a bug person : ) bug 1467517
original bug exists and also regression exists , as expected
waht do you think about xenomai..
there 's just one branch
certainly happy to have the factory there
it 's pretty common , i 'm surprised you ca n't find much ? ! ? ! good luck .
somehow , somebody else has always asked `` that '' question
also what about that phone in the bin bag , is it really just going to land fill now ?
be back in an hour
you got it : )
have n't you heard ? it 's # listentopopey now : )
sudo apt-get update
hezxchat is a fork afaik
yes
with low specs like that though 'decently ' is questionable
oui
try sudo cp /etc/crypttab /etc/crypttab.old
`` looks like '' ?
looks like your nvidia kernel module is missing .
how about in `` recovery mode '' ? hold-down shift key while booting to get the grub menu , and
wait - do you use different users for running screen ?
i rather doubt that .
^^
is there a xserver-xorg-dev-lts-utopic then ?
it has taken > 1 hour to flash mine at times . on other occasions , 5 minutes . seems
it installs fully
never mind
also look at different articles at debian administration
if you want it nightly then it 's just '* 2 * * * bash /path/to/script.sh '
that 's true
also , what do you have in /usr/share/icons/default and where does the symlink /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme point to ?
type grep greeter /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and paste here
what actual issue do you have there ?
snappy is ready now too , but i did not do further cleanups , i wait for an end-to-end test
same for surudark
and wich ubuntu .iso on it ?
k - just came in halfway through the conversation so worth a try : )
does n't look transient to me , it 's a unicode error based on the inputs ...
have n't checked , just plymouth spinning for a while
sudo stop ofono ; sudo restart network-manager
do you have any suggestions ? honestly asking
there 's just one thing i raised ( more an idea than an issue )
ack
not quite a chroot , but strict app confinement with limited access to directories etc
lp : charm-helper tests are passing cleanly for me
the thing is that yeah like .. its your network connection somehow
i am asking , do we *also* set an error on listspaceresults
i have n't changd the environment path variable
understandably . could n't remember how i had done some altering in the past .
the arguments thing is not caused by passing the '\0 ' instead of nullptr i have in some branch ,
but keep in mind i may be totally wrong about that this is a worthwhile goal to persue : )
probably
oh and we 're also still waiting for new merged stuff to go live as well
call yourself a canuck ! ?
i did get boot menu , but the only entry on that menu is windows boot manager , no entry
yep well maybe one of these days it 'll be a priority to put it into the launchpad backlog ...
you ' re right , that 's the result of worst var nariable name ever ( my fault ) a
hmm , adduser seems to create homedirs even with -- system ... that 's probably n ot terrible though ,
that is only a warn though , not fatal at that point
well that does sukc
afternoon
with the introduction of plasma5 things got renamed . kde5 means nothing anymore . it is either kf5 ( kde
my feeling is `` tb '' at least initially
no we do n't
ok , but i need the one you already have builded , so that is no problem
i mean base tree ... while building is used like 20 gig of space ...
and after place the link into the % path % ?
that will only erase the ones that you 're using right now
you type and we read . but maybe you should join a chat channel ?
directly plugged
as you can see , the documentation is sometimes more accurate than random users on the internet : )
why not ?
hello .
edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change archives.ubuntu.com and security.ubuntu.com to old-releases.ubuntu.com
without accelration the video rendered by cpu
do you have a machine which still uses a bios system ?
that 's the development site
ahh , i knew about turbine but i had no idea that warner bros. were involved with lotro as well
aah , so there is an sddm.conf file . ok , it should work then
if that ( not getting mir connection ) is causing an autopilot test to fail and the process depends on
^
very cool
affirmative .
it is raid , so it got no sda1 or sdb1 but /dev/mapper/ ...
at which point the phone dies
maybe you can use the yaml summary and description to explain what 's the purpose of the package .
so , `` accepted '' is not , actually , an error
can you get to tty ?
how is that in anyway homosexual ?
some servers have load balancer which use different mirrors then
supported for 9 months . 9 months .
can you explain the whole story ? what will you be doing exactly ?
yeah , i would love to have a mechanism via policy-rc.d that would notify the host that it needs to
i. e. if you have server and client on the same machine , start the server first , then the
whar does your /etc/exports look like ?
it was largish in that it was > 60 % of the patch changed
on just idle , not sleep ?
anyway , my jenkins is ready , got to go . i can prepare sru tonight for this . unless
you remember what i said earlier about mux-less optimus ?
okay well perhaps we are going to have to just reformat , because he 's no longer around .
yep , so for instance the location-service page has a section about debugging things
yup
he 's on freenode ( in # ubuntu-news and a few other places ) , so just a pm away
so , where can i put a .png file so it can be used through one of the categories ?
so when it sais start 1.00mib it is aligned correctly ?
no
nope , npm ones now
i do remember that indeed
i stand corrected ? ? ? got a link ?
agreed , my results are ugly
good point .
i have a dual-core atom box at home and mrs. lopta has a quad-core phenom ii .
and have seen no compelling reason to change the version i 'm using
which package ?
gnome-terminal should be in /usr/bin
it should , yes . i do have a second , external monitor connected . however , it wont start
but the client is never used , it is just there
well in twitch when i click fullscreen on any stream it 's crashing and it 's not fine
it 's running fine here
it depends on if it wheelhouses or not
this is a new policy group that was added
have fun !
i know the numbering fails when you have more than one terminal tab , are you using a single tab
that 's off topic here . # ubuntu-offtopic for casual chat
it 's got tons of problems though . most importantly , needs magnets on the roads : /
any idea where he 's getting the packages ?
one reason i have not yet applied it , as they may have reasons for that strip and then the
so you did n't do anything but at the same time tried some 'step from the website ' ?
this might be something : [ 2777.641687 ] i915 0000:00:02.0 : bar 6 : [ ? ? ? 0x00000000 flags
awesome , thx
not a bad idea
anyway , it 's clear that you just run the right python with the right extra pythonhome helpers and perhaps
one tiny sec .
does opera still contain an email client ?
it 's not my fault i ca n't burn a cd and try it in this drive .
not at hand , sorry ( ca n't help right now : < )
reached my knowladge limit on ls , sorry
when i run nm-tool i get the response : disconnected .
yes , python3 is now default for xenial , catfish , menulibre , mugshot should all be functional
so opinionated : )
i will remove it sometime before the next hour , as i have time from my regular work . try
# neoscoin exists
i 'll take a look
repeatedly asked what vm ! you are the one that brought up vm first !
you seems to have home_mailbox=/var/vmail which is probably wrong
are you guys by any chance building hedgewars for the phone w/ mobile enabled ?
that is up to each hook
or gdm or what you have
for ubuntu i did it manually on my machine after downloading 50gbs of the archive
then let 's wait for sogou plan
seems to be detected fine . have you tried firing up a video program and seeing if it works ?
amusing note : current xenial netinst produces a machine that boots to a point where it goes idle , and
done
finish that up and ping me
you have scrolled all the way to the bottom ?
it should already exist
ah , that might be the issue
workout what 's wrong with the hook
i see , although maybe that could be fixed for every app.. by checking whether the win name matches the
chipaca is currently tsting bbb , i did some testing on amd64/kvm
were you looking at gedit update ?
absolute path
the only way you can let your package-manager live is with changing it to the old-releases
check 14.04 at the usn page , and scroll back to the time you updated
on 15.04 ?
seems that this does n't work : 0.229 does not seem to be a ci train generated version number ,
okay.. how do i do that ?
how ?
do you have a linux installed yet ?
saves you a lot of work in the long run
that means cold rolling cache , minutes of downtime for each host , very slow across many hosts , etc
actually , i run `` apt-get update '' first . however , i will do it again .
if it becomes a problem , we can copy the eventually . i really do n't mind about it .
you can also install 'pastebinit ' and run 'pastebinit file '
if we don't.. we can always seed duplicity back in
otp , now
so the juju-gui uses websockets to communicate with the juju environment
there is n't any tray icon showing there
no sir , i have not . but i can do now .
looking at the bugs in launchpad it hardly works at all , and not just for me ...
i 'd wait to see what the openstack charmers have to say
you could ofcourse testout lubuntu/xubuntu 14.04 livecd , to check if it mounts there
the mini iso ?
if should do something : )
well done ! ! again
hair 'o the dog in your coffee
you can quite easily dual-boot
your printer i yhink
x is incompatible with snappy ; you can have mir instead ...
ah , did n't realise there was a difference with the lte version ; do those not work at all
theme ?
no i do n't
well , you can adjust that , but it 's odd that it started out that small .
the point is just that if we get a failure as the first `` real '' xenial run we need
you should use chromium
oh nice .
and ?
3v ? lol does n't even make sense .
yeah i got that , but why are you trying to get to the recovery mode in the first place
specific to .deb packages ?
still a failure
undecided
there used to be applications that were packaged independently by both ( so two developers making a different packaging )
the data after the second slash needs to conform with domain name naming requirements .
yep !
tired . got up at 6:30
is that cache affecting ram memory or is it just stored on the hard drive ?
it 's not ubuntu .
if you check the code , all apt calls use this sources.list and other local directories
the thing is , what 's published , is not a branch , so it ca n't be merged
will do the eth0 approach , should be quickly done
yes , that is the intention , as soon as dannf 's manager signs off on it
u1 token that push client uses , app calling register gets a new separate token , and then the oauth
you asked about 14.04 to 15.10 .
yes , the == nil is empty
what am i looking for ? should i termbin it ?
ive never used gns3 but it will accomplish the same task as packet tracer
i ca n't find through inspect element the css selector for .skt-mob-menu
try it with rm -rf this time
with a budget of less than $ 10k ? not much : (
same setting as yesterday
other then the wrong lang that fixed it
also : www.fullcirclemagazine.org/downloads start at # 0 , continue to # 103
so once you exported , hw-assign should work as expected ( hw-assign foo /sys/devices/ ... )
i mean ubuntu version
final beta announcement ? yep !
no one is here ..
is it up ?
cheers !
genii : ok & thx .
the vivid images are developer builds
what gpu do you use ?
this is all one single issue , i guess
reading is good .
yes , its the result of trying to be as compatible with u-boots quirks as possible
also you need the right driver
i was told to report the bug upstream
that sounds like a bug
it 's a bit ugly though , it will help us when things go bad like now where we were
based on that error , i suspect you have an error in the lines you just added . they should
webbrowser is using cmake ?
oh , definitely , tell that to the ancient python scripts running here though
wait , you want a source copy ? not a binary copy ?
huh . maybe something was weird with the android recovery/boot . you can flash the latest android 4.4 for manta
\o/
perfect
otherwise i have to go through five messages to find the only relevant one .
either version is fine
; )
yes
i do not mean that those 32 failures are not problem ... but for sure they are not new problems
it was waigani that ran into the issue , you two can talk directly so i can go smash the
revoke the gpg key .
isnt it fine like that , can i just submit the change to bazaar and post the screenshot ?
will add later
in practice , what happens is that without the fix , i see that the currentindex is 0 , currentitem
yeah , sorry about delays , travel etc got in the way
and then ... `` the desktop is unresponsive to clicks from the mouse or keyboard input ''
go on ebay and get a usb/data device to plug in one of your old optical disks
thansk
okay , these sound bitesize : )
and i 've added that to the bug
hey , make it easy . install virtualbox . download the .flavors . try them in virtualbox . choose a
your are way to unprecise .
no the window appears , but it does take 10 minutes for my mouse cursor to appear there
docker ?
ericsnow may not be the prettiest member of juju but that 's plain rude
happy that i could be of some help to you : )
are you running a wily/xenial kernel ?
kenvandine : we are talking about two separate ota6 blockers ... both fix , but not incrementally
i see . well if you do n't need the gui , go with the server , less resources required
well , that thing was not fixed too long ago , maybe a month or so
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
ah ok , yeah . well usually i find that the vm i try to use needs serious updating anyway
xfce is the winning factor
if tj- says i will do that , since i dont have any utilty to back up
really ? so you use your admin account all the time ? does n't seem very smart ...
for push
report at component-mismatches looks good now
shutting dow .
in that case you should end up with 2 servers with the same package
`` sudo update-initramfs -vu ''
ok. one step further ... i managed to build it ( at least it says finished )
ok. did you reboot you removed the driver ?
well that is my understanding but always did this and never got charged extra
i was just wondering what graphics chips
i 'll have sergiusens check the code , and then ask him to publish it , yes : )
so why does that not work for you ?
nfs is very particular about permissions ; i notice fstab has 'rw ' option but your command-line does n't .
but for something like juju it would be fine
will have a look asap ( but piloting right now )
exactly
^^
yup , the way it works in clock is there is the list of built-in sounds.. then there is a
are that old games and they dont work with pulesaudio or alsa ?
no , bq
i doesnt make any sense to install drivers for your gpu without a graphical environment .
no it is inaccesible
( only noticed because i had to re-run a ppc64el nvidia test due to a different `` failure '' ,
it 's an install that 's about a week old , i do n't have any important data on this
tried that..nothing happened..
^
daftykins has already provided the appropriate factoid on how to remove the ppa
no , it will fail to ingest
nice calendar : - )
15.04
but we only update the mongodb cert very occasionally
attach them to the bug
correction : systemctl enable sddm
ideally the file manager will be able to provide a `` if nothing better is available '' option in the
point it at a silo containing vivid packages ?
i guess i 've an account from the before sso time but i do n't remember the password
i am on 14.04
ok take your time will wait for you
well it 's always worked for me ...
no . as we have newer version in our repos
maybe it will fix 15.04 from there
hmmm , yes , that 's possible . auspetrol over to you to solve this mystery of how you went
if you 've got manual tests , you can put it in a silo with those .
it uses the kernel from the archive
it is more important that you have enough ram . my laptop computer is using 1gb ram .
i see the comment . sorry for the false request . any reason it did n't email me the success
which kubuntu version are you running ?
i got the error twice in a row ( that is : booted an image from yesterday with -snapshot ,
if it 's started to boot - grub has already loaded
because i want
oh but we do n't have a picker which you 'll need ...
i was just asking flocculant but now he can see them . ; - )
however , the lp branch seems to be out of date
it now relies on schema
rtm , right ?
ok , when you create the ext4 in something else , select the ext4 one and choose the mountpoint at
yes . i can
intel linux graphics was deprecated for 14.04
saw my overlay use question as well ?
only to the extent of satisfying myself that it is n't hard and doing some extra api exports for it
paste the one you 're using
run udf with -- oem ./ ...
that 's good then . when pinging that server does a fresh start of g.e . still report the error
oh hey , it 's -- now
use the force
try `` sudo apt-get dist-upgrade '' in the middle then .
check the kinfocenter .
so be sure to have all the proper updates installed that come from the official ubuntu repos
but it si really a better one ?
check the detailed settings in the regional settings and change the time to united states
please drop it
you 're definitely using devel ?
ack , nw
ping 234d70df3522cb289a7f0d862841e696
what kind of graphics do you have in that machine ?
see also htop
my only observation is for the ci tests
wrong . if your data is n't backed up , it obviously is n't important
i suppose you just did n't enable this then ?
krillin . it sits at the `` bq powered by ubuntu '' screen forever
its giving me `` real 0m9.441s user 0m9.440s sys 0m0.00s ''
think about it as ... .. a gpg vendor is a vendor with a fancy dress and car , one
amazing = )
aquarius : it does ... but it 's not healthy : ) it only has 1.0 apis
still same error message
and yes , you did mess with the sources.list manually . there is no way a raring repo can come
nless you 're talking about sudors
and check if they were already uploaded through some different means , are obsolete , etc .
yeah alll builds in the archive are essentially schroot builds using dpkg-buildpackage -b or -b deepending on arch
only on android , right ?
i fear we may inadvertently slip into this again even using the rest api if we link against a client
which is your nearest city ?
any thing
as well you should be ; )
although after reviewing the fix my error might be unrelated
you 'll have to remind me the question
: )
sorry
amd have a habit of dropping support for cards very quickly
looks like before , no action anymore on the node while the client is still `` deploying '' ( repeating
so wily is the common factor
did you try with sudo ?
let 's try and boot to terminal . at the grub boot menu press the 'e ' key for edit
no , the == nil is not empty
find what out ?
i used to have discussions about how if 'ide ' stood for integrated drive electronics , then when sata drives
question : does music app even function if display is blanked & there is no wakelock ?
yeah just caught up on the bug email from it just a database timestamp that is mad
is the window overlapping the bottom of the screen maybe ?
uhm ... is your podbird.qml in the root when installed ?
the first issue is , 13.10 is eol
so whats the correct way of building .deb
lubuntu 14.04.1 ?
really though , 2 years without an update , vulnerable to heartbleed and other big ones , there is no
yes
most hardware is in the kernel . so you can swap most hardware unless you installed proprietary drivers .
check if your popup blocker is on
well , i see that it has options to all resolvers for interfaces
( non ) blocking should n't behave any different with stream vs. dgram and read ( ) vs. recv (
because that 's how it works now .
this needs to be confirmed . at this stage there is no py2 on the devices so it would seem
we built the image with the kernel on it .
if i 'd noticed i was near i probably would have done , yeah ; p
@ '' recommending $ xdg_runtime_dir '' you mean adding `` ( e.g . $ xdg_runtime_dir ) '' ?
to verify your ubuntu iso image ( or other files for which an md5 checksum is provided ) , see
it would be a fun exercise to restore it , which should be possible . but being a vm i
no

ahahahah ok tell me how i can help = )
sorry , i could't find it

i 've upgraded from 14.10
and wow of course
because of the name
they have already made pretty much clear that the mx4 is not `` it '' , and also not the
my hue tap does n't even have a battery : )
ya , all good : )
wound up converting the images i care about to not use a backing store , then blowing away the simplestreams
so you want a personal repo ?
do you see anything when running `` dmesg '' ?
too excited . hold on .
sudo apt-get install php5-cli reading package lists ... done building dependency tree reading state information ... done php5-cli is already
r u ocr ?
i know that feeling ahha !
your go tree should look like /tmp/scratch/go/src/launchpad.net/snappy .
major services like google and yahoo often have guides about how to stay on their good side when sending mail
yes . and syslog
cat /proc/cpuinfo
any new services you installed ?
i 'll be back then
would journald pretend it 's syslog ?
yes they can all go away
no this failure occurs only on jenkins
well from what i understand you would store the secret before calling override
i 'm not quite understanding what you mean by what i tested . could you explain ?
there 's an arch parameter , that 's what will be used for building the debs/image , right now the
yup , jcastro , jose and i will be there amoung others

you 're not unhappy with a -- system-site-packages virtualenv for dev locally ?
yeah , i did n't restart my session though , so the env is still set and i 've no

solution : remove that repo form /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
eh ... maybe ? ? ?
me too
/nick is your friend : )
got it . but why is the system so slow now ?
i will be around for a long time , just getting started here .
haha , it 's not just the qt file dialogs , but also some buttons and popups

odd , lightdm-gtk-greeter does not seem to depend on lightdm .
nope , i do not remember that problem
bug 1391164
did you just see it from errors.ubuntu.com , or did you file it there yourself ?
it really depends on how your device implemented dual-sim
i am going to run this my hand on the machine to see if i get something more
but currently , as you say , you have to get a list of packages and then query the rnr
i have

ubuntu does n't have the latest software , blah blah , you can do whatever you want but its not

install an ntp client such as the `` ntp '' package provides when you're done
it is executable

service samba status still works with systemd
yes , we wo n't be landing the rtm one , only using it for testing
i am using a cli based backup solution for my server .
yes
i do have a question about networking , if you have a minute
should n't buteo-syncfw be in that ppa as well ?
oh , it 'd almost certainly trash grub , so if i did upgrade i 'd have to install windows
no idea
well i 'm not sad so much as this has obviously been broken for me really recently - so should

cool !
try sudo service ssh start and tell us the output
ok - i have 1hr back of my day
yea
did we file all the issues we talked about earlier as bugs ?
i have an existance case to the contrary.. : (
which software is it in this case ?
are you doing dual boot ?
yeah , i meant , really if you are blocked : )
davidbarth mentioned there 's a hypothetical fix in the works for stability with many webviews

how can i know if i can rewrite the partition where ubuntu was and install a new distro there ?
if you add a new os grub wo n't pick it up though as os-prober is disabled , fyi
what would you recommend given its not the `` real '' fix
i have an xorg.conf.failsafe
that is very strange , because it 's the same command i use here , and my _sources.changes *does* have
go get it added to our toolchain and then we can talk

asked you a question , and 14.10 is eol on thursday .
where was he ?
do us normals humans , have a chance to look at all this ?
and have you installed a proprietary driver ?
i about fell off my chair when i read that .
did you know how to remove it ?

you either store mail for user x inside /home/x/ < something >
please pastebin a `` cat /etc/apt/sources.list ''
right , for a proprietary product from google - for a free os
hmm , something occurred to me now
that will create a url as output . show us the url
though , in that case , i 'll have to think of some way to clean them post-promotion , so
^
kiko : it worked
aptitude has n't been supported in ubuntu for a while . you might have been better with plain old apt-get
right , yeah , i was just hoping there was an instant thing .
yeah , or just use a ppa : )
did you have a chance to follow any of the slide work i published ?
you did sudo mount -b /dev /media/ubuntu/1312312312/dev ?
i 'll just say there are references to some operating systems ; )
ok
afaik blue systems will continue to support kubuntu , but the confusion around the personell on the kubuntu council and
as long as the file has a # ! shebang line as line 1 , the correct interpreter will execute
go to settings > network > proxy
well to be fair , it 's still acting like a directionaldragarea , just one that does n't grab input
check /var/log/syslog for messages from network-manager about no secrets or no agents found
we went through this zillions of time ... there is no os what provides you such developer experience . it
you miss out on the benefit of that when your tests ca n't be run automatically .
how to confirm ? , i see no option to do so
i thought everyone knew that : s
to ignore joins , parts , quits in irssi : /ignore # ubuntu +joins +parts +quits
yeah i was thinking that maybe rb 's diff just is incorrectly hiding that
reallocation can only occur if the data in the 'bad ' physical sector can still be read and passes the
meaning upstart/systemd jobs ?
and i have a reasonably good idea how to automate a test for this
try ping him on internal irc , should be there
yeah but that 'd be pointless - it 'd make more sense to get the wifi working on whichever you
it 'll overwrite the first ~900mb , whatever the iso size is . it wo n't necessarily affect the remainder
but be prepared ... the suspend issue you discovered will be still there on arale : )
make that a ppa-purge of the mc3man ppa .
yes i have done it about 10 times i have also remove a lot of list and it is still
nevermind my previous answer , yes i did have to propose all 3 branches .
btw , go get against launchpad fails with an insecure warning . is this known ?
and it would still be a good idea for you and odyx to agree on a single 9.15+dfsg orig tarball
what does yours do ?
to monitor what ?
well , given the contraint that it must write to the framework snap 's dir , no .
wel , that talk better suite in # ubuntu-offtopic
where did you get that changes link from ? 3.14.13-0ubuntu2 was never release to archives at least
i mean ... if decided to use juno in a 14.04lts what happen when ubuntu stop maintaining juno and i
yes , i can see that on my own system using `` apt-file list < package > '' since i
what version of go does that translate to on 14.04 ?
i assume you saw my mp moving qa links to common reference - wanted to at least get that sorted
like i do n't have anything special set up , let me dig in syslog
no
do you have an easy repro ?
sure , i may be slow to answer due to a lot of conversation , but please do : )
both are pretty stupid , & & means do command 2 if command 1 succeeds
either .
no , i do n't use devel-proposed because it breaks
yet you can still upgrade it .
yes . then it detects source depends packages ?
wo n't work until the turnip config branch has been merged however .
got fed up copying patches around . it 's fine really
i do n't think so
yea for sure - except no telling what 's likely until it happens
channels ?
and are you familiar with lts ?
it 's no
just let it sit for a bit . cjwatson mentioned the other day he was making some changes to the
or evtest
they are mostly pdf files
assuming you have an rpi 2 , then follow the `` putting the image onto the microsdhc '' step
and the problem with having something like ubuntu coins , is that then we have to track how many coins
who is your master ?
well , you have a million options then i suppose . i 'd go with ini files probably
what does it work on ?
well once you boot in i 'll give you the command to nuke the drive nicely
ah , i tried on chrome fwiw
i 'm having a hard time following this conversation ; )
rsalveti would know more detail
wouldnt the kernel depend on the packages ? i would assume the repo would think you would be at least
but at the moment , there is a shortage of working devices
cpufreq-info and lag .
have you done a dist-upgrade lately ?
well the pc part works in the sense that i can still read the messages on the screen
trust me , we have the same feeling : )
when submitting , why ?
+1
hah , that 's the second time you tell me that . sorry .
i am totally positive that i didnt understand your last suggestion
usually , though , you can : )
ah , no . it 's handled completly by the shell
i just tick the box ; with full exports it 's not really important to update the `` last used
right , unfortunately ntfs is the only practical option on a mixed os network
that 's doable
mostly you just have to know which user ids are used by which programs , know which directories they need
this works for me ( uses the trunk copy not dist ) : pythonpath=~/code/touch-apps/camera-app/trunk/tests/autopilot python3 -m autopilot.run list camera_app
when i first decided i wanted to transition from a debian user to a debian contributor , i subscribed to
my point is , your issue is not an ubuntu support issue , it is nginx specific .
oh , thats good news
thats a path where a user doesnt have write-permissions .
maybe it gets restarted immediately due to new clietns connecting ?
just saying that i followed that tutorial
ok - uploading now - it will take a few hours to complete the builds
i would point out # snappy here on freenode as well
i 've notified the sdk engs
so if it did n't run today yet and i shutdown , then it runs when i boot fter 4
and only over cable
they 're still laying around . really the only gtk apps i use regularly are pidgin , terminator , and
asus-wlan is n't soft or hard blocked
latest that is posted on the abobe flash site but i recieved it through ubuntu update repo
i 'm breaking for lunch , let 's talk about this later
i 'm just checking for a second opinion before i make my recommendation , give me a couple of minutes
yep
right , for dbusmock ( test dependency only , not on images )
but it should start with unity
open a terminal and type dmesg
it is just annoying . it is a brand new laptop ...
i 'm going to make it to the catchup btw
i will create a changelog document like lasttime to help qa
we just have to somehow differ uploads which only have changes in the packaging . we ca n't exactly bump
i 'd like to know if i should rebase on that branch ^^ or sdk 13
it 's an optionselector in qml
thats not a problem
no
only the push-client , dash , location services and scopes have crash files
just dont ' do it , return it or sell it and buy a asus
cache in /etc/ is really ugly too , though
ask in # # hardware
i just mention reality mate , alot of users get this after updates
indexurl : = systemimageserver + `` / '' + path.join ( channel , device , `` index.json '' ) might
it was a chroot related change in debian ...
let me know if you need any help with that
yeap
wich instrument you play ?
version ?
do you have the vaapi extension packages installed ?
has ever worked on that laptop ?
ok , let 's try , /me kicking rebuild
oh , with \n nothing happened
i am living in germany and i dont wan na know the weather of berlin - or the weather of
correct
sure
everything got new version numbers . and 15.04 was the first ubuntu with systemd as init
ho/// ? you cant sell gpl . can you ? gpl is opensource
i 'm a bit confused with the newest 1.24 and master branches ... it 's just too messy . i
dpkg -l | grep nvidia | pastebinit
sure , since this is n't a known thing . but more or less try and run any autopilot3 test
from a fresh install of what >
i dont see you point of lowered productivity .
how are you ?
explain ?
with wine
because the ssh one is very scriptable from perl : )
well , the one i received yesterday did !
is your user in the lxd group ?
the files appear to be at /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/fontawesome/
i suppose i could send you a screen shot of the desktop but that might expose something i do n't
whether the 3g connections ' endpoint is the new default gateway or not
i have no intention of ever building another vivid iso .
what channel should i be on , on krillin ?
sounds normal.. if you have not `` unlocked '' the keyring
why log in as root ? why not just use sudo ... .
i will try that now
then from a terminal in the same directory run $ md5sum filename.iso
what does your clusterd.conf show ?
ls /home/ ( do you see the home dir ? )
ok , i agree
you can always reconstruct it to your liking
we need a new signal then ?
list
trusty meaning , 14.04 btw , as opposed to 14.10
! ! !
i am running sudo ddrescue -d -d -- force file.img /dev/sdb program ends with error : ca n't open input
in the future if someone else comes up with the same question - instead of telling them to use something
w : not using locking for read only lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock e : unable to write to /var/cache/apt/ e :
you too , if u find something let me now , i 'll consider change gui
yes . do i just create that in gparted ?
i know how to run it , i need a way to allow the script to complete before logoff
you got my spanish and uk phone number ?
for the binary package ?
so , basically , the idea is that you install ubuntu-make ( to get the deps ) , then git
2 minutes and i 'll find you a helpful link
re-running the job with the same parameters in this case would confirm if they are transient
now you do know
are you using chrome or chromium ?
and i then commented on it
try `` telnet keyserver.ubuntu.com 11371 '' and see if you get connected
now what
yeah , i 'll talk to him when he 's back around
right but as zram is a virtual thing , someone needs to ask for it , for udev to even
only special system services can continue processing while screen is locked
yeah , i figured that after seeing another issue that was unresolved
so still two days for all of them is my thinking
type ls -ld /lib/security/pam_kwallet.so
the mda alone is not enough
wo n't lp just print it ?
paste your sourceslist on paste.ubuntu.com please , let 's have a look
as usual , if we pull this off then xfce can benefit .
sounds like fun : p
no he does n't ; )
instead of each anonymous visitor causing code to be executed , static html pages are served to them
do you have a valid ticket ? apparently klist will show this
sudo apt-get autoremove *might* help
and that getworldcenter ( ) has definitely fixed the issue : )
its a little bit frustrating when im getting errors every 5 sevconds ... at the *system* level
ok
if you omit the `` new '' method , does it make a difference ?
yes
well , i doubt that it is not working with 14.04.3 with the 15.04 kernel and xorg settings . but
ok , how does that happen ?
?
ahh , ok .
should probably unlink invalid ones
if somehow upgrading corrupted my os , would that mean i could n't access files in home or system ?
you can change dpi settings if you like
git gives me all the buzz i need
he 's working on it while at a conference
then sudo apt-get upgrade
oh ok , did n't know what was the state before , it could be very well that qtmir goes
but that template also includes an app and ui stuff that make use of the extension
does it turn off completely ? as in you have to press the power button to start it ?
export gtk2_im_module=fcitx chromium
i 've never done that before
right , so for libraries it is mostly fine to use stage-packages as they do n't have complex debian hooks
dep8 would be great
nothing would work without rebuilding
debuild ?
go to london to the office ; - )
ty : )
great , i 'll rebase mine and hopefully drop a commit or two fixing already resolved issues on master
yeah , i would argue wait ... b/c engineers are gon na ask `` did you get a crash file
so a fair point , for ota things will still work
still offtopic
right keep looking been awhile sine i 've used it , but it 's there .
yeah , the fn key control wireless and htat i have
if the server does n't have much ram then out of memory killer can be a common issue *if* some
there 's a load of bugfixes in frameworks that are dependent on 5.4 at buildtime
is there anything else i can convey now ? i 'll check back in later but i suspect you 'll
that 's production
hmm - which version of the init script do we get in ubuntu ?
by forking long before the branch was stable juju core agreed to do double merges fore every issue .
14.04 lts
the nfs shares are indeed specified in the clients fstab
right
no , both are ubuntu 15.04
so the idea was to have a little mini-event on release days for snappy . have folks come and hang
which suggests that xsession is n't being used for some reason
it does n't generate a .crash file
what filesystem is that share ? ntfs can not be chmodded
isint it rc ?
oh , not that again : - ) bug report please ; also provide me your working dir
ok - i removed the double reference - left it at the top as a warning
and btw , the feature only works on the device
are you aware of any silos that have packages that have autopkgtests ? i have some autopkgtest stuff i need
... sure , but the point is to be able to serve an arbitrary installer over pxe . that 's
this is what i ran : `` root @ fardarter-desktop : /home # chown -r fardarter : ~/
anybody can contribute to ubuntu at any time
there are copious logs captured in linux , and they 'll usually provide evidence of the true problem
hmm , we should be able to keep it there and have a test script that calls python3 -m unittest
are you sure u
sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
try lubuntu to see
what 's the ordering bug about ?
which is easier to maintain than an eternal patch
np , i can dig myself : )
what *do* you get in the recovery environment then ?
i changed the uuid because i did n't realize the uuid you were using was the uuid of the sdb
are you running the build under sbuild ?
not completely awake here . needing coffee , brb : )
qdbus org.kde.kded /mainapplication quit ; ( kwrapper4 kded4 & )
newer controller , that is build for ssd 's . apple has got it in its new mbp
yes
i guess something is wrong with insmod linux
those are standard upstream paths everywhere
needed to avoid a migration
that was brave , media-hub is a bear to compile
cool
yeah $ 25 bucks is more affordable
no firewall . i have no problems browsing to the nas using windoes
that 's what i 'm thinking
nice . a couple of other people have attempted that
and hurray @ backporting \o/
i have n't manually installed anything else yet . how do i purge ?
my qa is done incidentally
yes - prebuilt binaries from apm
being a good app is n't the only criteria
does it build and unit test ok ?
yes
i could . i 've left a small osx el capitan partition in the even i needed to update the
yeah ... . there 's something that prevents it from running on 14.10
sure , why not
ack , our team is going to have a big requirement for at least storage soon , as soon as
most systems do n't do that . bugzilla etc .
yup
give me a minute , let me pull the project
the background are not updated to the proper version
sure
do n't know at which point the network was lost . have n't checked phone since went out of range
i said that . make depend gcc has screwed up the system .
then you cant perform admin tasks , like install packages
^_^
`` binary file linux_installer.sh matches . ''
look it up
indeed
zul ah you were just talking about it
: - (
heh , no idea , i just happened to log in to update , i 'm not familiar at all
or change the repo location to 'us '
nothing comes up .
yeah , that 's literally what i just quoted
d'oh ! ignore me .
i 'll resubmit with unreleased
people get shot for a variety of reasons , but that does n't mean that they 're all xenophobic
what does `` xrandr -q '' report ?
can i paste the information collected ?
ahhh , ok , sorry , did n't read it properly !
not all platforms have proper hardware cursor support . but software cursor drawn on top of qml could be done
not even ready for qa , anything in flight
indeed - alt+tab shows ubiquity there
yea its a third-party remake with the engine and raphics of later titles in the series
ta . the weird thing is that this was n't isolated , that build failed on armhf *and* powerpc (
( since they are slight adaptations of the go stdlib code and retain that copyright/license )
can it wait for a while ? trying to do a few things at once here..
thanx : - )
and i did googled for like 2 days and also i am a bit confused lol
yes , right now i 'm talking to you guys with my win 7 laptop
it looked like it worked right from here .
second party/isp opinion would satisfy me
i like the offer however confirming the ssl cert is the same cert i get on the desktop is desired
i 'm going to have to rework the storage model a bit too . because of shared storage , we
we also test ota in the sanity suite too
he did say 21-25
actually it does , nevermind
the hardest part was unpacking everything , once i had it unpacked it was super easy . i use a
turn on debug messages that might help
do-release-upgrade is the command to upgrade to new release
is there someting to list text editors ? its very ambigous question so i dont know what they mean
it used to be an upstart job , and we got rid of that to fix a bug from cking
we should know soon i guess when it comes to landing of silo 24
or , more seriously , subscribe ubuntu-sponsors and it should pop onto the sponsorship queue which gets frequent attention
wow , it does pass under xvfb ...
can i see the log ?
try pkill nm-applet & & nm-applet & disown
neither wireless or ethernet working
yep , i found that out by reading the readme
oh wow . are you serious ? were you under the impression 14.04 somehow leaks everything to the world ?
whats fqdn ?
some people may want the source packages
yeah , could n't sleep any more ... which is weird because i went to bed pretty late after a
if everyone ... such as autodesk was command line oriented
it supports mpv now as well , just in case you did n't know .
any way to reinstall software center ? and package manager ?
in a terminal window , please type sudo apt-get update
how are you doing ?
i just wonder how it was possible to publish that since it should have warned in ci train if it
why ?
got ta update that
what would you like to package today ?
if you put apparmour into complain mode using this command `` sudo aa-complain mysqld ''
something 's odd , because the dashboard reports it as 'silo ready to build '
when i plug my laptop out of the doking station , and dock it again the resolution change automaticly
i 'll ask around to see if they can be published , but anyway , they look 98 % like
: )
15.04 has some wayland libs
you cant , easily.. you can simply reinstall , or upgrade to 14.10 , then 15.04. i suggest backing up
nope , who 's that ?
both miracast packages dropped : )
ahhh . i 'm not so sure it will work on ubuntu touch
just tested it , and yes i have mobile data
anyways , this landing is good to go .
key.. it is probably waiting for something to finish . the question is on what..
do n't do anymore revert of this package or you 'll overflow the version number ; )
: d
it 's best if you do it from that computer . if you ca n't , you can start here
buy online if you can
well , i ca n't see all of the messages because they are hidden and it disappears when the resolution/font
no that is completely valid
please read that article for updating your eol release .
heh , np
good point ! ! yes : )
oh no , i 'm downloading for s-i , you do n't have it in it 's original form anymore
it seemed to running live , but on the reboot is where i got the problem
lets discuss about the closing parentheses when i return from the gym . i 'll ping you .
run tasksel -- help first , i might have misremembered the package name
this laptop is old , its a toshiba satellite m45-s269
just an update would preceded either
you have a very simple workaround though
with a comment , but how about those benchmarks ?
use the command i gave ...
sure , you can backup to blueraydisc
done , remember that unity-webapps-qml is also in your rtm silo 13
yes
yeah we can copy it to the stable overlay ppa where it 'll be held until wily+1 opens and it
okay you came to the right place .
you could boot with -kernel -initramfs -append and point that to your local kernel
sure , joining standup
it is optional so people always ignore it by default . xd
shall i just run staging-upload and throw applications into the ppa ?
and ~xubuntu-users
can have makyo look when he 's in , next 20ish
it would look beautiful , more like ios rotation
no clues , but i 've tried to delete syslog
it would indeed be good to add those as rawaccess collections just to make it clear that they should n't
you have n't asked an actionable question yet . what have you done so far ? what problem are you
it could be anything , doubt it 's logged
ya tongue tnx : )
wait , were are you recommending that ?
that 's what i was thinking of : d
/usr
run pbuilder-dist wily create
no , it should not change it
here 's that small go-amz fix
wrt question , i was thinking that the wrapper for binaries should cd to $ snap_app_data_path ( the one in
since you 're here a fast review would n't hurt : p
because the clock app designs that i have up until now indicate that clock app was meant to run in
yes . ugly hack , but if logs do n't give any information , it might help to find where
the window size
how to us otg and adb in the same way ?
in dialer-app dialing a key quickly 3 times only produces sound twice .
i have access to shell
it works as well . however , the browser is unable to resolve any hostname and i ca n't eg
i pushed all tags now , before i pushed a single one
i 'll write it down , but for now i 'll use that `` sha1sum < file > '' command
in which log would hints be hidden ?
works for me
this is ubuntu support as i said , for chit chat try # ubuntu-offtopic
yes , in a really weird way ; i retried it
i got that.. but you ca n't connect ? can you ping www.google.com ?
yep
then tor browser . it 's free and no set up .
why do you need a newer one , particularly ?
i was testing port 9999
rsync copies the data , it 's like cp but does a checksum too
oopses will be sent to rabbitmq if it is configured and running . it can be challenging to get them
i have a windows 8.1 aside but it runs without freezing
all mentioned tools are oss
that 's reaching , is n't it ; )
utopic-qt54 i 'd say for name
right so change from port 22 , very unwise : )
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
i just want it fixed of course
oh great you 're back : )
can you try 'ping 192.168.42.129 ' ?
no . the purpose of protective/hybrid mbr when using gpt is to prevent mbr tooling that is not gpt-aware from
that 's fixed : )
ah : d
fixed and pushed
we should maybe triage jibel 's doc ; if it goes over this week maybe the work should be scheduled
when hangs , exactly ?
can you teach me what is it that you touch to get a new edge image ?
but if you onfigure it and reboot window will me rendred anyway
can i just merge the forward ports ? while i had to manually copy over the changes from 1.25 to
that 's the other route
the command and output
because i am pointing out the inconsistencies in your statements ? ok , thats not helpful for you .
that tool sets the different hardware modes of the monitor , the guys in # # hardware can explain what
yeah .. i did .. no idea what the errors are .. as you can boot to the boot menu
i hoped you clicked on the yes it was useful button
so some of it is protecting us against the unknown
initial boot is slow , ofcourse , because it sets up things on the background
sudo dpkg-reconfigure science-biology ?
we 'll probably want you to test as soon as we 've identified the bad commit but that might take
looks like you reinstalled osx on the entire disk .
pysdm is a nice tool to manage fstab for newbies its in the repos
habe you read the link ?
indeed
system settings _ > input devices - > keyboard - > layouts ?
that 's a good reason to not even botter to become a dd ; )
yes , and ci recognises that as a blessed branch . ci does n't care about a specific test .
chmod 755 test
how so ?
which file or url ?
added to the pad ; i started transitions of exiv2 and libxapian , wading through the build failures now
not at all . i assume it will look like in vivid
`` it just works ''
because partition table is fucked up and it 's raid1
k , let 's do that and i 'll try to get something else
ok , so my 'bad ' is .depends ~ /liblog4cpp5\b/
what about it ?
if one of those will suffice , you ought to be able to select a new kernel at the grub
already did.. just brings up same controls as `` system settings ... '' > `` power ''
maybe someone has , do you have an issue ?
mirv only_free_silo .
you 've got it next to it in provisioninginfo
the seeds are fine : )
i see no uefi entries now
that 's cool : - ) just trying to figure out why the line ends overshoot the the mouse positions
well , like 10 minutes ago
strange ( file should exist as you have rebooted ) . think'n .
try hexchat ; - )
if you would like to confirm this , please do
welcome yo sista
sde2 isnt a partition containing a valid filesystem .
are you fully updated ?
awesome !
are you using omitempty ?
have you packaged 2.9.8 ?
the current qtmultimedia that is shipping in our overlay is diverged from the july upstream commit and has new features
fwiw , that was some of the first code i wrote for juju ( and in go )
what graphics card
yeah , the first paste is the syslog from the first boot since this is failing
i 'll just assign all bugs to doko
open source drivers work well , but i cant tweak such as contrast settings
can you pastebin those logs ?
o/
the one in unity8 has country info as well ? ca n't see it there
but if you know what you 're looking for input-wise maybe i can do it async ?
does mediashare have permissions to access the parent folder ?
maybe something using select_related ( 'page__id ' ) .filter ( path__regex=regex )
you could try the 15.04 daily live image and see if that works better
wonder if i could get scenegraph to tell me in a small qml app
try that : )
you guess ?
is this a rther older system ? can you tell us more about hardware , graphics card ?
brb
wich ubuntu version do you have ?
yeah , built fine on jessie , without that patch
sorry
and polls about ubuntu-forks arent relevant to support : )
you have to compile it
find the physical switch on the pc and press/move it !
14.04 comes with a 3.13 kernel
well not random , give it a sensible name : )
intel and amd regularly update said black boxes for bugs , security issues , etc . sadly , they rarely
hummmm , ya , i probably was n't booting from it ... so , perhaps you 're right ?
chargers gets *hot* ( not just warm ) is usually a bad sign imho
you running g-c-c in unity ?
just wait until it is released : )
btw , run it against wily , not wily-proposed ; it could be that the wily-proposed libgphoto2 also breaks the

grab the bottom edge and reduce the size while holding shift
$ 40 says it wo n't
both are in ppa : noskcaj/staging
wait
to me this motivates a mir test client which renders at 16ms
is that folder there ? is that file there ? is the filesystem healty ?
no problem , always glad to help , and very glad to hear things are working out in the end
why ?
i have checked , and it is running
excellent , really great help here , so ask as needed . ; )
deb2snap ; it 's how we built the demo snap .
still didnt fix it : /
ah , ok , i see the silo is for vivid , right ? let me fetch the links for
sure , i just do n't feel like dual booting
and dpkg -i over ubuntu5 reproduces this
and under /mnt/ do you get public_html ? or /home/cryptodan/public_html ?

thats a sign of using too much windows and less linux experience . the name troll just fit him right
ok , so about availabilityzoneallocations..
i appreciate you 're trying to help but given the above pastebins your advice does n't apply
let me upgrade
i signed the package today , but it 's complaining about the signature from the 14th
first thing would be to figure out what things get mounted and unmounted over time ... then the question is
yes
yes
so they are not so complicated so we can maybe wait a few days and if no one review i
file content indexing
how so ?
time for a new password dude
^^
or something more elaborate ?
thx
that is pretty awful , tbh
answering your question , you dont `` switch '' between them , discrete is always used for display , and
nvidia gt 750m
yeah , that would be perfect
no ; from another terminal you can send it the usr1 signal to get it to report its current progress
after ota-9 however maybe possible
it will depending on the network setup have its own tcp ip so you can do anything ssh/x-forward etc .
anyway , this will be more important in the future when you have ci tests that rely on macaroon authorization
sudo rfkill unblock all
you said nothing about ubuntu touch
phone images are now produced from vivid + `` overlay ppa ''
yeah that should do the trick short-term
i see `` sudo '' , but not `` sudoers '' , which why those would be exclusive groups i
i am using different laptop for free node
i guess you edited your patch for bug # 1435492 a little bit too quickly
pretty strange that it fixes itself when he disables/enables
or for now use slider.value = slider.value + dv
then check if plasma , libplasma and plasma-desktop are ticked
the code has n't merged yet
yes , they 'll fail
i guess i 'm imagining more of a client-cooperating resize
clear apt 's /partial/ directory etc . , and re-try the `` apt-get update ''
and how do i turn it back on once plugged/unlugged ?
i gave up on rhythmbox and such and hear radiotray or from my mobile-phone running my google music app .
it 's not in gsettings , it 's a code patch , but sure we can patch that
like ?
i sincerely hope so .
well i finally changed then or you would add a comment that i those are nto the right ones each
right , cool
i can try to do my best .
so , it 's the pre push hook that is invoking go vet - perhaps there 's a warning level
hope all that helps , different options , hopefully just needs this fixed .
because the unit tests specifically uses it
doing what '' ?
if the /home/ directory is on the root file-system , and that file-system has only 5 % free space remaining
so after 18 years you found out ?
but then it would n't be clear where to get the diff from
trevinho : uploaded
interestingly enough ... the same thing happened for popey
it says it 's charging . it 's at 24 % .
i 'm on kubuntu , perhaps dolphin features ssh connection too , i 'll check then
i see vivid on the iso page , is it safe for me to trigger that yet ?
well , that lists all things that depend on it , whether you have them installed or not
he wants if both are in the file
however try make distclean after renaming
well it 's the one you merged ; - )
sure .
no worries , you can join # ubuntu-touch too for those questions
one big problem , and one stylistic
could you provide me with the smart data of all disks ? ( sudo smartctl -a /dev/ < disk >
potentially . unttil they decide they do n't trust that either : )
works pretty nice
can you pastebin `` nvidia-settings -- verbose -- query dpys ''
next step ( tomorrow ? ) would be to downgrade to -10ubuntu1
i 'm leaving the room , no - install all your updates and get the drivers on .
definitely looks like a kernel bug ( might be triggered by hplip ) . lsusb hangs ...

no . but do write your complete question here and wait for a response .
yep
dd is fine ; what is important is *which* set of sectors you save ... the entire device including partition
yup i get that error
how you getting there
so what happens when you do 'sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get upgrade ' ?
but think i got it right
yes it 's the truth . my cat always disturb me.always looking afte me whereever i go.but more seriously i
either way md5sum first then , it 's hardware based if it checks okay

eheh , it might be the easiest option ...
with explanation

sec
all flavors had same error ?
as of 15.04 ubuntu uses systemd , i would do a fresh install too
smb/cifs isnt even routable : )
pong
how to set an password to root ?
well , i dont know right now .
-r is recorsive , -nir is case insensitive and shows line number
just a note , those macros ( should actually be functions ... ) are meant to be wrapped
did you have a good time off ? : )
10 minutes and you 're out !
ok - so lvm support
a website where you can upload images
most likely , do n't think it would make much sense to assume it 's bq . we already know
so if this change is already in wily overlay then it should all be fine , just merge the version
bootstrap just worked
yes , but if you get rid of them , then we know , and add you to the nsa

you can mess with other oses from ubuntu/virtualbox afterwards

let me know how it goes , we might end up filing some bugs : - )
yay , i 'm still downloading : /

heh - i see . i only ask because i 've noticed an uptick on review comments giving different guidance
i did a dial-number /ril_0 123456789 # 1 and worked

you dont need `` midi in '' , though , correct ?
every time you use xgettext , you point it at some code , and by default e.g . it looks
it was so i could do things like install themes for geany . the folder is only accessible to root

why u no use znc ?
oh : ( i thought these where canned things

do you mind if i move our sync two hours later today ?
in that particular context , it seems a bit confusing
^
sure , that works
# # linux in general
and what did i do after that ?
it crashed
did you try extending for less than 100 % ... a lot less ?
ok , so if that method is n't hit , there 's no way the app 's qt.application.active would change

i did this : iptables -t nat -a postrouting -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o venet0:0 -j snat -- to 168.235.66.43
can you remember the recent bug that e-d-s corrupted some settings or something ?
its reccomended to install a version of the topic
maybe its time for a fresh xubuntu install ?
what version of ubuntu are you on
we just need a -generic for that i presume ... will get that sorted
let me do it
no . that calls myscript.py with the argument /home/ubuntu/testing.txt and then redirects stderr to stdout .
what compression codec is that with ? the spec says it uses wmv - which is a container so i
n
i.e the login screen is stretched on both screens
right i missed three on all archs , but those can be fixed by a new merge right ?
it not like a video where you have control in the browser , never heard of what you want .
right , and it 's passing there . damn it
nice . got it
nevermind , misread
that is not to say i am not interested to finding the fault that the gui does not start in
type gnome-terminal
no , that is not it in this case . `` apt-get update '' does not even show ubuntu checking
maybe wily is zero importance , if we only care about phone and personal , neither of which would track
wait manual distro upload ?
agreed . i will have more nm updates on the way . i 'll re-review the email trail on this
it might be a bug in testtools , it 's not exactly polite in its interaction with unittest
but if you look at the diff file in 46 's ppa it looks like that build still pulled in
my boxes seem to be fine
would that machine run a different os ?
ok : )
what are you doing exactly ? running the versionupgrade ?
that might be useful , but does pandora.com not work on steam ?
at your service *hat tip* : )
one sub carried a mile to a repair shop ; )
yes , a few fixes for broken apps
ah duh , i have recreated the merges , just forgot to update the spreadsheet , fixing now
have not created one yet , just started ( run ) an python:2.7 to test
you mean why not invert the if/else ?
all flashing carries risks , but for androidy-type things there is usually a solution to reflash through recovery
why ?
harder than backporting the fix but should n't be too hard to change the default to alt+ctrl+s and also support
i also experience a similar issue , but mine has black borders all around my windows , pop ups ,
may i ask which drive ? is it a skylake build ?
i thought the show/hide whiteboard had disappeared - found it - and edit spec \o/
yes , there has been some concern about not using tasks . still , i see this whole transition to
apt-get upgrade should do it
any ideas when 3.16 will hit the archive ?
though it has been test built ( other than zfs because that wo n't cross compile )
well , immutable is not the right term - you can add to them but not remove existing ones ,
will do
urgh
just wanted to see if touch could be easily enabled . i 'm just hoping that it can ... the
you said to tag a new release

so presumably your motivation for the initial question was wondering why the instance poller aggregator is n't seeing env config
dont want it to be sudoer
oh so you mean even if the nephew did watch porn there so long as he uses the guest account
of course
yes , maybe . it will help if they see test coverage and test results .
twitter card support
if you install trusty , you get upstart as pid 1 , yet there are pieces of systemd daemons running

it 's the tool we 're working on to make building snaps really easy .
ok , i 'll dig into this i guess : p
oh , that may well be the case for nm specifically .
it 's not seeded , i 'm fine with that .
this thing has been dragging on for longer than one day sir

popey : the next release should bring theming support , translations , auto-delete of old episodes , haptic feedback .
however my replacement networking hardware just arrived
i 'll smack it around a bit .
as in what you see when you run it
14.04
its pretty much as octoquad said
ok , i 'd recommend you reinstall ubuntu in uefi mode , you could fix it if you wanted but
i saw the same thing during easter .
yep
thats what makes it work
did you install any graphic drivers ?
yep
it 's a picture of my head and arm , waving at you : )
it does not
exactly
in the early days it will be one big image , where apps etc are in the image , but
than for a moment switch to intel profile - type in command line : sudo prime-select intel
why are you back ?
i 'm not going to be able to do much with the driver until i can get back in -
it does
the systemd/network stuff defines the naming policy .
sounds reasonable
i am smart by birth . please ignore me .
not how i remember it ... i convinced you file managers were lame : )
are you familiar with how the initrd.img is created ?
are you also using a firewall ? what rule did you add ?
make sure you remove any reference of the old /home partition in fstab if it 's currently in there
cpome over now ! ! !
it makes sense to anyone with at least the technical aptitude to know what ipv4 is
he already has the i386 arch that is n't helping
at least on debian/unstable we got a few crash reports caused by the gcc5 transition
nah , just another os ,
do it using hte installer
oh , interesting
oh ok
hmmm ... possibly : )
the application asks for a mode ( say r/w ) and that gets combined with the umask ; so what
cool bro
ok . i given it.but anthy was getting yesterday
just add a rule to the respective chain for allowing incoming connections on port 8000 .
have you tried disabling the wifi , then re-enabling it ? sometimes that works to settle it down .
not really , no .
vivid has add_package install tpm-tools in auto/config
okayish , i 've got a bit of a headache , i did n't sleep too well
check with sudo lshw -c video
read logs and see if the queries are even being received .
it would likely be read-only , at least to start with
there 's also the libopengl-perl regression
i can track down a tarball of my last build state , if it helps
yes , it is . some file managers even handle that if you click on an encrypted volume
enjoy ! - it is easier than it looks
that might be , let me try a different usb , even tho i 've had problems with different messages
ok. np .
you did n't .
how do i cherry-pick the pr without listing out the 37 commits ? picking just the merge commit says i
it worked perfectly ? : o
dimitern : when its host is finished with the container , it needs to somehow inform the state server that
hassle more , upload anyway . what are you asking about ?
one is n't enough for linux
sure looks funny having all the links on the left though and then this giant empty bar to the right
we could start it explicitly inside apiserver and that 'd be ~fine , modulo all the yuckiness of writing ad-hoc
`` trying to cover all bases '' < -- - those words
no , the original bug has never not been fixed
said that 's done ochosi
good choice .
what ? : p
must be due to the already uploaded tools
well , you 're certainly free to flash a different image onto it as well , which does n't have

short backstory : i wrote the nagios check for ntp because we could n't find any existing ones that actually
well , the first column can have many `` root '' pages

actually i might be wrong . i 'll double check but i locked my sim and have to find the
yeah , i just got a latest model dell , and had a really hard time to get ubuntu on
can you add it to ldflags ? ( scraping the back of my gcc knowledge here ... )
the gui is probably holding that lock
because /boot could confuse it , could mean /boot or /mnt/boot
i guess thats what that python+lttng stuff was intended to make easier ?
need the exact error
kactivitymanager segfaults
looks like a theme that does n't support the gtk version you are running
right . i always forget that # xubuntu-devel is user friendly ... # ubuntu-devel ... not so much .
esp b/c they all get watched for changes
what 's you query ?
help ! channel emergency ! ( only use this trigger in emergencies ) - pici , myrtti , jrib ,

ubuntu , like any other linux distribution , has built-in firewall capabilities . the firewall is managed using the 'ufw

why should it ? when gvfs ran for glib2.0 , it passed

yeah , but vers = '12.0.0 '
attributes or assignments ?
which ubuntu version are you using ?
support for vivid is in # ubuntu+1
it could be from the uefi i have in my machine as well
it seems it was n't !
already done months ago
cheers !
why were the colons failing tho ?
returning an error i can probably work out for myself ...
try pressing ctrl+alt+f1 to get to a different virtual terminal , then log-in

it 's not really sensitive data
does a server install give you something close to what you want ?
drwxrwxrwx 6 leesh leesh 4096 mai 4 15:58 /mnt/container/
sort of ... .
if there is no ksycoca5 file then just run kbuildksycoca5
but where did i get ubuntu ?
is 'what ' documented , precisely ? whether or not to use partitions ? it 's an administrator decision usually
those that come in later on : )
in dolphin/devices ?
yep , that 'll just be the minimum to install - but not to enjoy
but that 's the craziest thing i 've ever heard /ot
yeah seems to work here
well , you can just login to the server to check
you boot the ubuntu iso and the install process walks you through it
so how would you force propagation of updates at a later point then ?
what mir version is on the otas ?
i try just with pico test123
works fine in a guest user account , so it 's me again . and since it 's not universal
unless your ubuntu filetrees were inside lvm , and you used 'ext2fsd ' directly on top
i have n't yet done the previous mp , sorry ; it now looks even more complicated than before ,
... and it finished building on amd64 1 minute ago so it 'll take 15 more before it 's installable
master is unblocked thought - you should be able to go for it now ?
i had n't seen it , but it seems you can ignore it
it depends on the device
ok , well i 'm fairly neutral about if the process migrates - 9 times out of 10 i would
and it contains all the list items visible at a time ... + the cached ones
i would n't really worry if it 's 32-bit powerpc only that 's flaky , although at leisure it could
yeah you have to select the correct row first , that 's how it figures out what row to assign
oh , was it that recently ?
i 'm waiting for a new spec updated to reflect some aspects for bluetooth headset
yeah if you have critical data then it 's understandable
ff has flash off
i do n't think it 's possible b/c sshrc is run before the remote command is run
it 's running now , will see how long it takes : )
do you see any of the charms currently in the queue ?
re-ask your issue in chat here once in a while
and it does n't show a /dev/sdb5 ?
check tcpdump
sure , feel free to bring it up on the list
that is likely . a fresh samba server has no shares configured . configure them in /etc/samba/smb.conf
it 's just useless ( and in fact makes things worse ) on a desktop ssd
in vcs that is
i thought it was present before too , but go on
it should work the same way as a usb stick right ?
pfft , weechat is better ; )
i have been submitting patch to indicator-* to add mate support so i do n't have to no-follow .
that 's just not bios it should be fine
md5sums match
but you probably want mvo to actually shepherd it through ; there are a few other worthwhile improvements in lp
it looks like it does n't revert it back
on a related note , g+ hangouts are memory hogs
and when you go to open that application , nothing happens ? and there is no little dropbox icon in
which c compiler are you comparing to fpc ?
ping ping ping , print server does n't show up in the options for the server iso , this test
or we could bzr pull -- remember -- overwrite
yes
i can add a # hack comment to make sure that we deal with it
it basically just says /tmp/**
that is absolutely wrong
i came into this a bit late . are you trying to use a vpn or something ?
oh , ty
ls /dev/disk/by-id probably gives more info too : )
argh ! ok found it
is there any better packages for power managment for thinkpads ?
if you have nothign constructive to say ...
says `` start : rejected send message ... . ``
going to add the hack in for -settings too ? i 'd think there should be an actual fix though
so it clicks the right spot if you read it manually ? if so , we can check the ap
yeah , the standard test works for me as well
k .
can you set # ubuntu-discuss to your favs
i still forward x , so some fonts are needed.. i know it seems strange
no idea what you mean be `` at the side ''
clearly , you either have one of three conditions , either an incomparable cxx compiler / version , the cxx
already told you the link to fix
my first advice is to read the licese you 're applying .
then an update-initramfs -k all
is the timestamp supposed to be the session start ?
i 've testing 15.10 since december
laney : ok , cowboy solution : i temporarily disabled apt pinning in the worker
ok , we need a core-dev review for this
it means a named group of subnets
so it a selective shut up them
ok , type ren e : \efi\microsoft\boot bootmgfw.efi.backup bootmgfw.efi
i do n't think snappy was explicitly mentioned . this was more of a user-driven interaction type of thing with
hey -
do you want the lp bug numbers in the debian/changelog ?
oh , i see
because it has no idea about the dash
aggregated scopes or scopes in general ?
bzoltan : 14.04
i wonder if this is your first build for power8
that was my reaction , too : ) i 've always had this issue whenever libvirt opens an image it
i. e. python distutils
^^
no - i 'll hack on my krillin device but switch my sim to the old samsung
yes systemd has a separate flag , all of linus ' rants are storms in teacups
that 's the idea , yes
installed nvidia-prime aswell ?
if i get env from u8 terminal , grep for bus , and then copy that in to my ssh
ok , it 's ready now : )
great . we can wipe the fakeraid meta-data and the mbr and start fresh then
tsdgeos could you try to remove the db and check if the freeze is gone ( at least initially )
who to talk to wrt this ?
you missed the part where repthis1 ca n't get past that error message .
you are a star !
servers cost money
i want see the log file for which access denied happening and it 's ip address .
then you looked at the curriculum ? : )
that 's not going to work very well if you 're uploading packages to ubuntu , as they wo n't
and what happens if you start unity manually ?
hmm , make it `` aplay -d front : card=mobilepre , dev=0 -c 2 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/front_center.wav ''
oh yeah now i remember , so you 've yet to show me `` mount '' in a pastebin
also what is the hdd size ?
you can switch to vivid easily . however in big caps `` things might break '' .. so obviously it
for single use , you can try teamviewer also
i installed cuda , i still cant click on anything
is that the definition of `` absolute noise '' ?
that 's a very personal kind of preference ; i use hexedit ( terminal ) for simplicity but there are
as there might be ips in neither of the ranges
lool stripping
i havent rooted my s6 , if i do samsung pay is gone and that might be useful
scottk : it was n't in the archive
the client is __________ ?
not that it should really matter for apt-get but ...
i 'm just trying to understand why the remount , rw did n't work
do you use arguments type ?
it already does this : depends : lightdm ( > = 1.9.1 ) | gdm | kdm . i can
use aptoncd to back them up , put on fresh install and update
terminal is really important if you are a sys admin .
there are many things that you can not do on windows you can on linux .
how are you going to use x on a vps by the way ?
yes i do and i have lubuntu installed and with wifi disabled by switch error , so ia m using
well , the sru wo n't happen until it lands in vivid
^
good tool .
in another mp , i might add a few more debian arches ( ppc64 , s390x , etc ) for
`` 64 '' for 32 bit ubuntu ?
i have /home set as a separate partition
with this i am done , unless i start fixing the zoom with the image gallery preview
ok this is my concern
the only way to deal with c++ symbols files without clawing your eyes out .
and it 's 80 % of the time
yes , think `` airplane mode ''
alright i 'll be there . if for nothing else than moral support ; )
nope
sorry i typed in treminal and /sbin/mii-tool
i did
have you tried calling the partitioner on live or on oem mode ?
ok
sure . i was just thinking it 's a bit late . : p
that 's right , cheers
i just wanted to check if go get downloads the code for you .
: - )
when i remove 8gb , it still happens but less often
the one i fixed was about the s3 signing , due to `` : '' being in the url
could it be the address is already in use in my conf file due to an error still somewhere ?
sure gedit /var/log/syslog
wait until next week and try again ?
do you knwo if we push out the image directly or does it go to bq first ?
the only other thing i could imagine would be you 've limited the ap to x connections , and x
that 's the risk you take ultimately yeah , even using the disk might just be damaging it further
oh my , the silo dirty logic got very noisy recently ; - )
can you please try these ( or others if you have a better idea ) - the result we 're
what do you see when your machine is running and you plug it in ?
worth a try for sure
which drives , and where are you looking for them ?
ok
those are supposed to resolve themselves , really . as in they should auto-rebuild on each kernel upgrade . external/binary
i suspect we need it enabled in x just _really_hard_ to actually use , like a sysctl to turn it
now i have this crazy ideea that i can fix the booting issue with linux/ubuntu ... already booted from usb
sorry , let me explain better
so the source device is using gpt , and you can duplicate the partition table using `` sgdisk /dev/sd <
email saying that a day and time is being worked on ?
yes but theese 2
like , we have to be incredibly stingy with db access in the watchers
is this the version you have installed right now ?
thx . may give it a shot , later this afternoon . now time for gardening .
: )
depends on many things , explain the problem
the type column
you 'll probably have to pay someone to analyze and fix the board or power supply .
do n't be rude
it is all good because it is still the same ubuntu base
so really the only thing you need now is to get your hands on the output of the encoder
you mentioned a self made dvd what does that mean , sounds like a custom uck build from here .
so gnome-terminal , xterm , terminator ... plenty of others ?
good question
yeah there is a second one , it 's just out of view - there 's a scroll bar there
i 'm really curious to see your feedback on the new listitem api ... .
i 've been wanting to move to u1db for nearly a year lol
yeah , still awkward and probably error-prone and slow though : )
i cant
one partition will be ntfs and the other will be ext4 . easy .
word , spreedsheet , surfing , at . etc ...
your silo is approved . make sure the strings get to in launchpad for translation in rtm .
ah silo yes : can you transfer the build to whichever is free
that picture isnt mine configuration ! mine only shows stamp `` 3 '' option !
so the recover would be , on the system that lost the keys , decrypt the keys , then add
both posts together
the one that appears when you set x-ubuntu-splash-show-header=true
~/.local/share/trash/files
i do n't use unity , i use gnome : /
your call tho
you still have not the slither of idea what color management is
no , it should be all ok
all of which means : have you any pariticular dates in the next couple weeks that i should avoid for
-- ^
make a diff , attach it to the bug report ( s ) , then i 'll work you through
the cron log
the typo was mine , sorry ; first time i 've heard of it
probably does n't matter now , we can worry about it when it gets enabled without the feature flag and
thats a simple import away though : )
do you know if somebody talked to dbarth about those pieces and where we 're going to host them ?
yes
so you know an online resource to do that
yes ; i asked kees yesterday and he seemed to think the nature of these tests is more like ``
both numbers are 7 digits ... maybe the tech support rep i spoke to was confused about what i was
sorry . my parents went to ohio state university , some things are ingrained deep : )
the current driver only allows me to use one screen
is it possible through andriod ?
checkbox has a sever backend that 's pretty big and totally not packaged
or /etc/cron.daily
why those funny characters ?
standup hangout ?
yes - the orange logout completely caught me offguard ... swiftly followed by the zz 's on the hibernate one
correct directory ?
yup . i 'm 99 % sure
i tried some months ago to do such thing and i could n't , but i 'm decided to try
would a tts engine keep running if the app loses focus or screen goes off ?
yep , uninstalling and re-installing drops it from the sharing menu .
yeah , but it seems the typo is only on the title but not on the slug or redirect ?
no worries , but do need at least 1 lead to hand off to
right , so i should be uploading enviromental variables into dbus ... . however that is not in trusty 's
what kind of hardware ?
np . happy hacking : )
calendar app from trunk has the same issue
no.. : )
great ... now i have to wonder , how ?
ubuntu mate
did n't harald apply them all ?
not at the moment , no
i already said that i agreed ! : - )
generally speaking , installing a driver from oem is the last resort . drivers are available in our software repository
that 's what the ibm people did for their charms , and they added a config option called 'accept-software-license '
i just have something against the way its marketed , single process containers were n't any good for me ,
wow , is there any further detail you can give that 'd make this easier ?
ok , type grep cmdline /etc/default/grub
then why does it only happens on this laptop when running ubuntu ? it does n't happen when running windows
did you restart in between ? ?
ubuntu version ?
from a chroot yes , if you mean to an install , live will not save added to it if
it may be prudent to close # 29 as thats a juju issue and not a plugin issue .
best guess , rubbish password on an account ... check your history to see if any commands got run .
i understand that gdesktopappinfo might not work that way , but maybe we could have a small patch to it
\o/
tail -n100 /var/log/apache2/error.log
the window opens and i enter my password then nothing
when i put manual , then 192.168.0.100 then press the magnifying lens/search it appears at the bottom of the list
particularly the part about split packaging
yeah but he 's not here .
indeed ... and the released apis are supposed to never change
that might be a little inflexible though , i have n't given it much thought
it might also be that the data uri is getting scrubbed by qtmultimedia ( including our own plugin ) in
i dont do anything , printenv has a newline at the end of each line here
right , so that is not a shell
how do you generate the symbols ? nm ( 1 ) can demangle as well
it sounds like the cloud installer installed and used the latest version of juju
rebooting like crazy , sometimes i have a hang which unblocked after ~30s , sometimes it will hang as we
yes connected
yes you should have something like that
maybe my mirror is outdated ( at.archive.ubuntu.com ) . i 'll try switching to the german mirror .
then you are looking at using testdisk . that is the utility i see most often recommended .
+ ati drivers are crap
in the _terminal_ type this : lspci | pastebinit
sure it is , jenkins is just a management frontend to lunchpad
ok , but it would be good to check it !
yes
uhm ... yeah.. you should
no
i do n't have any , it 's just us and mmarley , and maybe jderose
ok. why did you remove all linux/initrd content from /boot/ ? is that what is currently preventing it from booting
which package name ?
i would also advise you to file a bug + askbuntu your speciic issue
i 'll help out . just a sec
or you could basically just have the plugin install a symlink
the username and password is a red herring
i 'm not porting ubuntu touch ; i 'm porting gentoo and this may be helpful
^
yep
have you tried with 1.22 or 1.23 ? that should tell you if it 's a regression , or if
some files were added to the vcs_files list in the past few weeks
looks like an xorg.0.log to me
in this particular case it was his idea to completely remove , history works much like logs
does the .novarc file look right ?
: - )
ask nicely , show a diff and explain the bugs fixed , and explain how it fits the general rules
okay , then i 'll move the ui forward .
was there anything further ?
the budget for a modern game is , dev+marketing , 8 figures .
depends on the exact card but the performance is better on newer cards . but older cards get dropped from
ok. you should be able to backup your files in `` low graphics mode '' .
bug - > gnome-settings-daemon and center-control after boot and load desktop
do i need any ppas apart from the snappy one >
i installed and tried bot trayer and wmsystemtray but the first overlaps with the kde taskbar and the second starts
i 'm updating the qml and will push a new version , hopefully jenkins will get a package for you
assuming you start xev from a terminal here to see the output too by the way
which `` routers operating system '' ?
just curious about that issue w/ py juju client and 1.23.. just looked up the bug report and it looks
possibly , it 's a bit dodgy to actually get to the reports in the first place ... if you
okay , that 's what i was asking . it does mean altering d-i to use -- - as well
another option would be to modify the mpeg4writer class to feed the output into a very tiny web server and
use dconf-editor to change that
but now i notice that for an actual *.torrent file , i only see ktorrent in the list ... .
sure
np
ok
dashtempscopeitem.backclicked ( ) ; is cheating
grub-pc i have
oh i know where they are , /usr/share/applications ; / $ home/.local/application
looks forwardable to me if they want it .
for 'juju create-environment ' not necessarily
feel free to ping me to confirm anything else on the retail device which does n't require going rw or
have you updated and upgraded lately ?
what are you trying to do
probably just needs some testing to see how it actually works ... but i was getting numbers as strings ,
you got k-lined this morning ?
want me to keep xfce-4.12 up for wily ?
indeed , tcp:172.17.113.167:6633 tcp:172.17.113.167:6633 ! = tcp:172.17.113.167:6633
seems i found a way to avoid that error ...
actually more like ppl working on the core apps in the nite , hanging out in this channel atm :
the phone is n't really yet , there are just a few systemd things installed , but upstart is still
explicit sounds better to me
i believe so : )
depends . what packet and how did it install ?
i knew it , you baited me with two small mr to drop the bomb later : p
i 'm not going to go and catch the fish for you
sadly not
in that case , you are relying on microsoft to package for linux ...
it shows icon ant teh downlaoded item description
yeah that i can confirm is fixed .
you got it : ) to install lubuntu afterwards you 'll simply do `` sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop^ ``
bus 001 device 005 : id 2001:3311 d-link corp .
there seems to be switches to do with setting and getting available info
sounds good
i know !
citrain device-upgrade 28 0000 ubuntu
ah , maybe the change was n't there when the silo was built ?
immediately after login
well h2 has 28px font size and 22px ine height so as has been told before , this is wrong
is that pre-existing or new ( a-la latest qt or something ? )
this isnt windows , you dont need a gazillion sites to download stuff from : )
ok tnx for investigating

no clue , ask # ubuntu-devel or # ubuntu-release perhaps ?

there is a bug reported
nothing except [ 0.184415 ] acpi pnp0a08:00 : _osc failed ( ae_not_found ) ; disabling aspm

sounds good , i will : )
no
in some cases , having to targets works better ( new lib version etc.. )

nah
already done , no result .
i do have ppas . would you like to see sources.list ?
if you backup your /home folder , thunderbird is backed up as part of that automagically

seb128 any news on uitk and the problem with uss ?
tell me if the wording is right
on a `` normal '' install .. /swap can be anywhere and as well a swap file can be abuwhere

alsa being lower , pulse higher
details matter a lot . so make sure you dont make typos now
i 'll send an e-mail
12.04 is supported for a bit longer .
any help will be appreciated on the issue on sound
prepare a seed mp please to make sure it doesnt get typoed or some such
hang on
so please pastebin the information requested .
ah , ok
ooooh ! ! feed ?
because it is a vps perhaps ?
that is why advanced help is needed : )

have you played with the adaptivepagelayout thing yet ?
so i say again , go and test your company 's product with 14.04.1 updated fully : )
exactly . they would n't be able to receive any messages in whatsapp unless whatsapp was actually running in the

it will only work if the app is also using a dda and that dda is using the same recognition
yeah we are not expecting professional level mockups , but more like a proper reasoning to design a component a
no variation , no deviation , starting at the 'sudo ' and going to the end of the line .
mterry_ is looking at the packaging changes ( we created a new package for the mission-control plugin )
it should mention optimus technology somewhere

there are some changes i am carrying that are probably not suitable for ambiance and radiance so i ca n't

wich 14.04 you got 5 years support now . so you dont run in the problems like you did with
cool beans , i 'll send ya out an email when it 's ready
did you reboot ?
on 5.3 ?
too many projects and real life issues
just removed the line and did a puppet restart
yeah , options for your new gnome shell and for unity .
although our motivation to prepare the patch was to fix a segfault in mate , other gtk2 applications are affected
still not really understanding why not to setconfig and be done with it ?
with router connection enabled ?
talking to bots has its magic

the nls_utf8.ko module on my system is in linux-image-extra-3.13.0-46-generic -- try installing that package , then try modprobe nls_utf8 again

you can if you are feeling brave create the lxc containers with the right bridges/networking and then manually introduce them
claudiupopa : so i had an idea : we could make the persistence invisible to consumers and only happen at

what happens if you try `` sudo ip link set dev eth0 up ''
yeah , and easy to tweak in the inspector
the reason for downgrading is stuttering issues with h.264 and v4l2 . read somewhere that the issue started after kernel

ubuntu quality team < ubuntu-quality @ lists.ubuntu.com >
the error could be coming from that
anastasiamac is up for all call reviewer , but i would like william to have what he needs in the

yeah i can
newer greeter might also need a newer version of greybird
not necessarily tracker-related
does the livecd work ?
the problem is , i can not mount it . as i 've told some people here yesterday , i

there 's a link in the bug to do that
any other tips ?
well if openvpn gets installed as part of some test config it 's interesting but not really that serious ,
are you forcing a new window ?
or you write it in shell or a simpler framework , like boot-smoke

ubuntu 14.04 does n't have java 8 already ?
the train uses a pbuilder that matches the series is building for . so you get gcc5 in wily and
the throngs of juju core developers applaud you : d
yes , i would like to , but i tried at 19:00 , and they did n't care
yes , we 'll get them there .
this time i can confirm that the changes are in effect , so that should be picked up
let me look , i do n't think that landed , but maybe there was an mp for it ...
`` which dokku ''
ubuntu is a popular distro even outside of south africa
hmm . is that signal not already emitted on line 574 ?
did you logout/reboot ?
what everyone else is saying , it is likely hardware
when the header is exposed and you scroll up , the header stays exposed ( does n't move )
rbasak : that 's quite likely - lem me check

how do i get maaz to tell him that when he returns ?
^^ on my mako with wily
i 'm really sorry for ranting , but with the sheer amount of problems.. i 'm sorry , i deserve
what 's the goal ? reseting what the gui displays ?
crap . would be lovely if that 's was the problem .
okey.. but keep in mind that anything what is integrated to the ubuntu sdk does come with the same branding
happy anniversary !
it 'll save you hours , or days ! as i and others said on saturday , if the dist-upgrade
so the fact that the version is wrong is understandable , because the way the train works for a dual
would you paste /etc/resolv.conf ?
ah , that sounds fine ; i thought you wanted to do fileexists=/etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0 , which would be a bit pointless
i 'll reupload it
im not here to blame you mate , but the user is responsible for updating system
is any thing wrong in the rule .
not working i get tar : error is not recoverable : exiting now
that is just finished up what i was on
sry i disconnected for a sec , i read that its better to encrypt the swap as well so the
do not use ifconfig
secect which os to boot in your bios
i step away from the laptop for a bit , but i will read scrollback if you have any more
file a bug , report it on qa tracker , and write a short report to attach the task ,
maybe its blocked by modprobe
maybe i did : p
ehhhh ... .
i 'll update the review - how about the live tests ?
sudo do-release-upgrade should get 15.10
i thought of i3wm , but heard it does n't play well with swing stuff .
what version of ubuntu are you running ?
thing about atom is power use , just like arm
please also fix kdebugsettings stable and unstable
for sure . so treat it like a new drive , and then move over everything on the old on
i am not talking about boot-repair . do you have access to hdb ? and is grub-install available ?
support is pretty active today
no . i wrote the iso to the usb to install on a machine
appreciate it . i 'll try to figure out why it crashed .
that was updated on tuesday , not now . it just migrated
yeah , wish i was just focussed on storage
it was removed after iom iirc
you come in , and the noobs start to troll
pastebin it .
that might be the good answer . ok it is default inability , e.g . default settings disable screensavers and
what happens if you boot your computer with the network cables unplugged ?
yep .
nah - no ipv6 there - just a link local address
did n't do the formal checklist though . i 'll add that
how does one set the backup capability ( assuming i 'm translating that right ) ?
do you have an ubuntu-related question ?
^ 4.14.2 ; )
is `` 10.10 '' in the agenda a typo ?
no , only tried to do it locally
dunno , guess you could wait a bit and see if anyone shows up
why would you share ?
^^^^
hey
did you try searching qtcreator ?
and that breaks the rule for frameworks
no
nope - it 's been quiet on that front : p
_slm_ already said the password problem was a caps/lowercase issue he solved
you mean like the 600 odd packages that get bug reports but never any reply ?
ok , done
ye well , not only qsignalspy then , signal-to-signal connections too , i 'd say even signal ( ) to
right - these are user files and he 's setting them to be owned by root in the home dir
same as for glib-networking , timed out waiting for ssh
a bit xd
natefinch : wwitzel3 : you all ready to do the demos ?
look in ~/.cache/upstart on the device , also look for apparmor denials with `` sudo dmesg | grep den ''
^
server side scope . try `` songkick : u2 '' in your unity7 dash
umm.. i suppose qa.. really ci is n't too affected , but both are indeed affected , as is the
emacs heads love org-mode
yeah . bet ya you are out of the danger zone . but , /boot , /usr and /lib are
hmm.. i wonder if i did something special to install flash on my chromium..
qml ones , as you wanted me to have a look
so if that arg is used the image should have s-i-cli instead of s-i-snappy-cli
error : can not autolaunch d-bus without x11 $ display
not really
sure it 's not , i just not boot into lubuntu : )
sudo nano < file >
really ... all cpus nowadays from intel and amd for computers and laptops are 64 bit .
how long does it take ?
in the api doc folder
looks like $ prefix/a and /b both have the 3.19 kernel
try a tail -f /var/log/syslog and play with suspend a bit , see what errors you get there maybe
you are good , they are the same
good idea . so if it 's just about the compiler flags , could the cmake file not just replicate
it 's mostly convenient , no magic . but for everyone that should mean kcm-checkbox or global shortcut to get
check that there are no spaces after the username and password
let 's cut down on the chatter .
transmission running again
ok , stupid question ... where is qastaging ?
ok , i will correct the milestone names
until it 's updated there 's not much point trying to fix anything
what is the issue ?
yeah , please merge
um , i do n't believe that 's the issue
how would i go about checking ?
or do you expect we need longer ?
to where ?
i have an app that is running as 32bit that cant use the 64bit drivers , which is why i
cool , just checking
bootstrap with an alias just worked for me too
if your sure fastboot , secureboot are off and ide to ahci enabled
i have 1.1+15.10.20150519-0~341~ubuntu15.04.1 from the recipe .. that is newer then any release
but clearly was not working
ok i have updated now its backwards compatible and consistent
ohh.. ty
server ; )
you select a category from the dropdown then it pops up entry boxes
yes , i agree , but the spec says otherwise for the desktop
we 'll pass that by sergio when he gets back , see how he feels about a default target again
yeah , the folder definitely needs world execute permissions if owned by root .
atleast the one phone which was supported best a month ago .
so it keeps restarting the connection
details
would it not make sense to have it as part of plasma ?
nope , i have logged out - and this is a very local private server - i do n't plan
k , rejected the old one , new one in the queue
then right click on the desktop , choose add panel , then in the add widgets type launcher and you
but best is you test it yourself
yeah , that 's a bit fiddly with bash i guess
what new feature is needed ?
how 's it going ?
or you can do manual parition usin ' the unallocated one
what are you specifically looking for ?
kross master build qt5.5.1
i 've forwarded the list via email
amd64 ?
can you boot a live session with the ssd installed as it 'll be usually ?
not just 'clock ' ?
dorf actually i 'd recommend installing the lts , and then if there are any hardware issues ( newer drivers
i dont ' run linux on a mac.i dislike the way scrolling works on mac os .
i personally do , yes . for my desktops i always use the latest , only use lts on servers
i see no result .
all of the faq articles currently are end-user stuff
not really any configuration involved ... just tell it which partition to use ... it will even show you what
i do n't think so
you 're saying windows does n't boot , correct ?
do i install it using the package manager ?
hey , sorry , had to step out . back now . there 's just a large-ish list of ops
i see that you are an asset to ubuntuu and the decision to make you as an op was very
i did notice tho ... .landing-030 is now against wily but also has `` target ppa '' set for overlay
as long as you keep up to date with security patches and such , for both the websites and the
ah.. i meant , is it usb or headphone jack ?
no
how do you think i 'm on irc right now ? live usb .
trunk has the same
type sudo apt-get -f install
qt.openurlexternally ( qstring url )
i have no idea what that means ... i mean practically
to make sure they do n't break .
yeah , i could make a quick stand alone qml plugin that exposes all the qstandardpath stuff , could be
i added a couple of comments to the model doc clarifying ( slightly ) about the moving of subnets
i 'm thinking rather than trying to fix it , the easiest thing would be a new deployment ?
my point is : should qtmir call cursor- > hide ( ) whenever a new display is connected or should
which obviously i ca n't reproduce here
i guess that is given by fact that the skype source was not correctly added to the source list
well , i still have the vexternal shared to vinternal , but in the vms network settings , i have
kdm ?
i can reproduce this by dist-upgrading in a cloud vm if that helps
you 're right
direct uploads to the archive by core-devs are supposed to be automatically picked up by the train
done
lovely , i guess if you go 64 bit that 'll complement mparillo nicely
because that 's how we roll ? : -p
i can do that at home but im screwed when connecting elsewhere
still have plenty of room .
sure
i 'm looking at the iso for 14.04 on my computer and it appears to be 899m

it knows based on dns
`` sudo netstat -np '' plus whatever other options you need , such as `` -t '' for tcp
perhaps i 'm doing something wrong though
no i here today is my last day and alesage is here tomorrow too
we have some questions regarding silo 23 - it seems it 's the final piece to fix trust store integration
why would running them under lxc help ?
trello - tried that for a cycle - not using it now
can you help me with installing some packages ? i 'm getting a 404 when i 'm trying to install
: d
yw
sounds good to me , and maybe something we can discuss in depth later ?
hein ?
yes . during install the bootloader install failed . i told it to continue without installing , and then ran
is there any other update needed before landing bluez5 ?
if that is supposed to be at the end , i ca n't see it .
umm , well , you switch over to a vt and in the vt screen , it is asking for
ohh i see , weird irc stuff
are you booting into lxde ?
so the gedit issue is gedit not properly supporting xim ? can you write that on the upstream bug ?
i do n't mind maintaining the wiki and sphinx but the problem is pointing new users/contributors to the right place
okay , if you could just run health-check against the new executable , wakeups on idle should be 0
you did click the `` apply '' button afterwards , right ?
once an exectuable program , or library , is loaded into memory it will remain in-use and available whilst it
the partition manager does tell you
also , my version passes because for some reason , the lxc data dir is /home/tim/.local/share
fginther , like 30 minutes ago . said fixed it , it is running , and i should just wait
has embedded solutions bored you ? or did you get annoyed with some bug in compiz ? ; )
usefull : - )
yes , installed a fresh version , and then restarted the vm
it would be a good idea to back up those config files we modified in the event you *ever* need
wait , now the - should be *after* the package name ?
np . i 'm looking at this upgrade issue anyway .
i also see these are a little bit behind comparing to my other systems with kernels , they do n't
in the chat window
do you remember which file is the bootup init script ?
meth=not good !
ok . i definitely saw issues with manifolds restarting , and also one with the metrics spool dir not existing
disk light still going ?
yep , please keep it . we can use much of it when adding the migration-mode field
what are you trying to reproduce ?
if you really wanted , you could
for virtual interfaces , the tools will allow you to give the interface any legal name you want
look at ./meta/package.yaml and ./service
ah ! that could be !
did you fix the issue with the oem snap in rolling ? ( bug # 1477224 )
when you buy a cape from a company , you 'd expect they 've tested it .
it makes it very easy to find . but then , that 's kinda my job .
er yeah oops kind of too late on that bit
yep , i 'll fix it
what 's that , some ff version rebranded ? or an entirely alternate browser ?
seems bug # 1261916
using snapcraft ?
strange
haha , anything could be better than ubuntu on my current desktop ; )
what op you in for if you do n't mind me asking ?
14.04 is lts
should the version be 0.4.2ubuntu1 or 0.4.2 ?
( for next time ) is it obvious where the partitions lie ?
did that fix you mention ever landed ?
i am kinda like you - i fumble around and it mostly works , till it does n't , then
rsalveti ah , snappy_trial_boot
is it minecraft.png or minecraft.svg ?
ok , type sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
looked it up earlier when someone mentioned it , apparently ubuntu mate is an official flavor starting 15.04
i 'm neck deep in other stuff . maybe ogra_ or rsalveti know about wily image builds ?
i have seen people try .
all apt-get install does is searches a known list of repositories , downloads the deb associated with a program ,
you can just switch to user mode with `` telinit 2 ''
i am finishing on the nightmare that are twitter & fb shares and will comment : )
voidspace : i know we 're not doing that yet , so having the assignment in the provisioner *for now*
i dont see anything in the backscroll - fire when ready
what was in the merged tree in case of conflicts ?
did you see my diff ?
dolphin is kdelibs4
ota8 train has left the building : )
right ? we don't ^
ah
ah , you 've unity8 running . instead run `` mir_socket=/run/mir_socket mirout '' as rooy
wb
sounds like that package caused the builtin nfs on the synology to go beserk
and it 's responsible for returning the new state to the executor
the udev binary did n't change at all , just the partname rule moved to a separate file
i 'm refactoring addnetworkinterface to be less icky hopefully : )
bird 's eye view here ; )
type apt-cache policy virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
thats good
i get logged out too every now and then
system-image-common does not ship any client.ini file anymore
welcome to lubuntu ...
ok
stop your nonesense now . no profanity
go into the connection properties and select to not obtain the routes . depends what you use this vpn for
for what where when context ?
that /store url already does that
hm , looking at the source synced should work , it should at least make my files appear
`` debug-hooks exit 1 '' was either not implemented or it was and was lost in a version
my best guess is , from what i can see , that originally /dev/sda7 was probably about 116gib and /dev/sda8
bit weird you do n't use sda1 really
sure
well it works for me
i removed anaconda ... i updated to the latest curl 7.40 ... .
it sounds like a problem with the system ... possibly hardware
yes , rvr verified
yes
ahhh ok , it might be worth sudoing to root and having a look at your .bashrc and .profile files
or dpkg -l | grep -v ^ii
in linux they ask first and keep asking , so this seems most likely a difference in the way they
used to be that the charmstore url ( `` cs : '' ) was what you could dump into quickstart
yes . upgrade , too . however , the upgraded packages are not preserved between builds . there is a
yes , its a live hangout
and you know ; there is a lot of them ; also xfs.mod here
thx
i 'd done apt-get install systemd-sysv but not dist-upgraded
is it installed or not ?
i can only watch ~30 % of the music videos that davmor2 posts at times ... youtube germany locks me
just xorg but i dont have much exp
haha
so if you use seahores and delete the `` ubuntu one '' token , i suspect it will ask you
ah that 's great .
name the module x_custom.py but call it plugin : custom
you could setup a script on the opposite end that exports the x display to your location and runs a
2k8r2 standard
install it , or use some awkward awk command
i 'm ruling out the launcher now
you wish
ok , nm
14.10 it is in the repos
yeah thats ms2
in debian is broken too
max pids would be cleared on a reboot of the system.. right ?
if you login into the commissioning environment , logs needed would be /var/log/cloud-init.log , cloud-init-output.log
i believe it was enabled in experimental for a while for 4.x series
i hate creating json maps in go : -/
the download tells me the lts edition is supported for 5 years , more than a non-lts . and i
sure , have you changed the name of it ? and rebooted to stock lubuntu ? if not , try
for some reason they just fixed it in the chromeos kernels and not upstream
so that error printed to me

usually the usb device will be listed twice , once for efi mode and another for bios mode , but

yes , if there are relations in the bundle , juju will know 'if this thing has any units it
when there 's existing partitions its much easier to reallocate them to lvm than to try shuffling existing partition data
could this be the intel/mesa extension that got fixed in wily ?
opengl works on both client and host separately .
weird issue indeed
thx : d
agreed ! !
ok , did you talk to the kernel team about it ?
i would say , just let the workers running - dont think of it as a program , think of
we can bring it back .
stop making panic ! ''
then what i would do is to rm the `` flash link '' ( the symbolic link that chains the

hah , cool .
ok
join # gentoo please
gfortran transition started , however some packages already migrated to wily , and are broken
then that 's a different issue : )
ok
yeah
es means they default t spanish
in theory that should work without any issues . make sure you install all updates as soon as they come
ack , tnx
just run `` md5sum whatever.img '' and paste the long string of characters into google
actually , i guess its in 14.10 now ... just not on 14.04
let me catch up with that discussion
on the generic linux box , do you see xterm in /usr/share/terminfo/x/ ?
i was just going to suggest that
ubuntustudio is a collection of packages for the artist who wishes to use ubuntu as their digital audio workstation .
generally , that means a missing wait .
will lp : media-hub be the branch that 'll be used for vivid only ?
done
maybe it makes sense to split up the two jobs

the xrandr command with the cvt output .
yeah , there are guys who make those mods and then guys like me who use them heh
i was n't exactly complaining about my situation : - )
yeah , that 's ubuntu-emulator

the plan ( as i understand it ) is to have it done before the jam .
i 'm just sort of copy and pasting from here :
but i read it as `` gpid-cpp '' is rc buggy and removed in debian , so we could think
it 's my layman approach to change the hostname if changed somewhere

it 's like you knew it was my birthday this sunday

khangman in ppa fixed ... that should be all of it
no
ran it anyway , and it tells me 'dpkg was interrupted , you must manually run 'sudo dpkg -- configure
if you want lts , 14.04.3 is what you can do immediately , then go to 16.04 in april .
do you think xmir + firefox + mx4 would be performant enough to use ?
~/.ssh/config , yes .
also , please do n't swear here . but that 's one workaround suggestion i would say you should try
intel uses open driver , it 's already there
i just created a request for a nm sync silo , per the same method we last used to binary

dpkg-reconfigure $ package allows $ package 's configuration to be reconfigged , where dpkg -- configure will configure dpkg itself

however , right click on open desktop uses the small icons .
the wifi files are the nm wifi config files , right ? from /etc/networkmanager/system-connections/

it is `` in the kernel ''

pong
yes
i 'll kick off another run
any names of the other porters : p ? so i can tag them : d ?

panic : interface conversion : interface is nil , not *net.tcpconn
it adds trust back into the equation
i agree that its stupid that it lacks tests . i got a little carried away getting poc up on

for /dev/vg1/lv1 ? in that case it sounds like you have a vg inside a vg !
until you acknowledge how much time it would take to support an official port , i would n't say it
not really an agenda yet , as we just met the last week ... so probably there 's nothing new

did the computer stop at these errors , if not what did it look like when the boot stopped ?
nope

in that case try 'dpkg ' it works at a lower level and you might have enough overhead room for

you can try a community such as # opensourcemusicians

perfect . cheers
hmm i know you can env var it but not on path list
row does only care on teh widths , but rowlayout also needs to know what height should an element have
oh sorry , not i mean the ubuntu-themes decoration changes
i just did sudo apt-get build-dep qtcreator-plugin-ubuntu
^
there are no apps in it , it 's basically for testing so it 's fine
but , whatever . can hunt that later . for now , i 'll confirm that this is a regression
it maybe a timing issue , or a wily issue , or something else
ok , type for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run ; do sudo mount -b $ i /mnt $
and then reboot
the diff in vivid-proposed/unapproved , to be clear .
after installing through software manager it showed up which is ridiculous , why would it show up through manager and
but ubuntu didnt udpate anything and for example skype doesnt appear in ubuntu software er
server is the most stripped down and command line only .
that 's a result of having to retry the actual install and test multiple times , here 's a better
ah , well that is a funky environment , things are running really s l o w
will be done ; )
dunno , surely takes 10x the time over just tar xf
so true
and check if its your intention with locale -a
then type sudo apt-get update
yeah , it seems britney 's own reverse dependency map catches more things
please try chrooting into your installation from the livecd and using `` su '' to switch to one non-root user
no . `` brightness and lock '' setting .
but call it , we did .
it may take a while : )
yay , we got the svgs !
what 's the url for the app ?
again i marked it passed
oh , i am indeed happy : )
later
is this under x ?
last time i was in there we were fixing that crazy system image server indexing problem : -p
i 'd be more surprised if he had n't , because yes
right , so you can do the apt-get update hack popey mentioned , but it 's only a workaround .
or try debugging
as i said - my kernel is fine . any kernel > 3.18 will cause the crash when running the
if you are n't sure how to use a virtualenv , we can give you a hand in setting it
excellent . ; )
you missed an awesome conversation . pure magic .
no , it 's just the launchpad ui that picked lp : ubuntu/apport as default
yup . are you guys trying for music specifically , or will there be framework for any other app to
i could now remember the changed keys in a hash map and check that when change signals come in
just mount is fine
well , some people still believe i 'm not a bot .
tried , being overwritten at boot
ok ... what is the full path to the file ?
because addrs are given to juju by the environment , and we keep track of them in state - i.e
right . to me he said he would start leading the meetings again ...
so your failure is from the host via the upstream router/gateway ?
sure.. but , what im saying is , note the kernel version , and drivers..
i may have hidden comments
i guess that 's fine , was just thinking that
ho hum : -/
oh , yes , i do know that -- thing is , even when lxde will have/already has stable new
i am under ubuntu server
are you following some wiki or forum guide on how to create and use the chroot ? if so ,
nope , guest account has same issue
this is all in lp : indicator-datetime , yes
it does n't help if you need an individual user 's traffic to get split though , and there are
but if we are going to have networkmanager on snappy , why not use that for eth as well then
yeah , there 's the requests site : )
should n't it test that it properly gets d-bus activated ? ( or if it does n't do that ,
i just wrote in the install and the start hook some basic things ( apt-get , etc ) and nothing
yeah , you could `` fix '' that by forcing 4.9 until doko fixes his -5 build .
anyway , we should get rid of all the `` vivid '' or `` 14.09 '' ones and just have
sysadmin job
^ well , maybe ; actually you might not need it for new .rules files
i am wary of anything with dd . and my question was about whether the mapper path would make any
yes . env/export indicate corporate proxy ( sans subdomains ) . captured traffic indicates corporate proxy ( with subdomains )
my eth0 has a static address here in my net , so that i can reach it
wallyworld : i 'm beginning to think this idea of juju using maas ' cached images is a non-starter
how can i access similar hooks in python ?
thats a dual core i7
trying a crush -reduce on it ... .
ubuntu-desktop-next is not supposed to be installed , it 's the base for the snappy personal image
i can
ok..any ideas ?
what makes you claim that ?
can i pick your brain about dockerfiles ?
if you can phrase a more specific query than `` how do i set up this entire scenario '' it
resize windows ' drive from inside windows leaving space for it ... you can easily remove ubuntu afterwards
np
dooferlad , guys , will be a couple of minutes late for standup
but it 's domains only
but yeah i i will check with mzanetti the difference between tr ( ) and qstr ( ) later
create a /etc/init/pulseaudio.override file with the following contents :
it says i choosed not to install grub to any device continue ? i selected sdc i swear
some days it 's a bit faster : - )
is there a tool to check if all files are recognized by the os ?
that sounds good to me
ideally , we 'd be exposing systemd timers
you may also try palemoon . it 's a firewfox clone but sticks to older ui .
pretty sure that networkmanager handles that automatically so that the user does n't have to
i used reprepro for this - it 's not like i '' m putting a billion packages there : p
you were talking to him right before me : )
now it is ... i had to merge three changeloags
yeah
yeah , feature freeze for ota-6 ; )
indeed , but they also have more say on it than i
indeed , so far everything looks fine , but somehow it 's not resolving the missing build-deps
you 're wrong , since the 3.15 kernel chromebooks are natively supported
well for dekstops , i can buold myself , but laptops is something else
so i would like to write a script that starts it and afterwards resets my screen resolution
so i can use yagf only on > =ubuntu 14.04
oh i 'm getting the fatal error now
oh
can you ping 192.168.0.1 ?
and is it / which is full ?
ok , i 'll keep an eye out for it
yes
your devhelp upload , you forget the -dev depends on libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
i dont know , these days if youre short on space you might as well use a single / partition
cross fingers
also `` mv ~/.compiz ~/.compizold
so a new kernel but no modules , or rather , the filesystem has a new kernel abi and the
no .
sure
ok , ask the question the other way : does gpsd report failures to open /dev/rfcomm0 ?
inet6 2001 : xxxx : x : xxx : : /64 scope global valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
this should motivate us to find something different
have you checked that the public key was only copied , rather than moved , from your primary user to
sorry but none of the docs nor source packages you 've referred to are actually relevant . the reason i
that 's just a simple tidy up ... all the ids were strings anyway , and localid ( ) was
if you are generating these tones , then , you just generate what you like , give it its own
yes
and the vanguard queue i guess will work if it is done in a reasonable amount of time
nice ! there 's another one as well . would be cool if we could merge them soon
< 3 i 'm loving it so far /endstalkinthisroom
keep clicking until you find something useful . community wiki is a great place to start .
because you do n't remember clicking on the link
is it fairly straight forward to pick a prior kernel ? do i just call up the grub menu during
we 're missing out mate
what 's the best way to merge the branch into gomaasapi ?
please stop applying gender to your questions , it is not appropriate online
if you can browse to other sites using anything , no .
excellent , give me a sign once it 's published
the former
really ?
silo approved
sounds like a nginx.conf issue . maybe ask in # nginx or similar
no
yes , scroll up
sure , i meant why do the vivid ones have updates installed .
why ?
so you do n't use flash with firefox ?
yeah , we could drop the werror , the return in void might be worth fixing though ?
black background with a red circle with the spinning logo
so the headerlayout will have actionbar , title , sections
the binary-copy is needed , but so is ensuring the ppa field is empty so it does the normal dual
yup
open your image viewer and nagigate the disk
had a good flight back ?
hm ...
can you give me those ?
yes , since mount is being called by the script , it makes sense
no i did n't
given the whole debian thing is actually older than me i can easily miss stuff ; )
here is an idea for you , the specials should totally cover coolios gangsta paradise with just a hint of
sudo fdisk -l
any idea why that is when i booted with noefi witch ?
though you will still have to move the one starting at a larger offset .
as it will only work as expected when type==manual and aws_access_key is in os.environ
do you have a middle mou ... ^
looks happy across the board .
once the grub theme and plymouth theme skeletons are done , we could even make a public contest if you
just a minute
i 'm happy to just do this for 15.10 .
sure but without telling clients that they may talking to a multi-state server env , they do n't know till
doing that now .
then `` cd / '' and then if you 're root , `` mount /mnt/qnap/backup '' , else `` sudo
hmm checking rite now
3.13.0-58
of course , but you need patience . a lot of it , in this case
( or rather launchpad ) but i did the majority of the package qa this round for lubuntu xd
quick hangout so i can understand the architecture ?
there were 2 things i would focus on ... is the root file-system image separate to the /boot/ image and
what 's the *gitjujutesting.stub field for in the fakeapi struct ?
well the simplest way then would be : sudo apt-get install xdg-utils -- in a termianl of course
`` permission denied ( publickey ) . ''
the seeded-in-ubuntu tool
indeed apt only knows about what 's in it 's sources list
yeah it sounds like it 's working
because ubuntu doesnt like the ui
do you know what you did on that machine ? is it a server that is running ?
come on , do n't be a hater
you can potentially copy root 's
i want us to do it the right way
releases.ubuntu.com/
it does . it works .
will you be around for the meeting today
yep
yes , that sounds better . we can put a task in there about figuring out the best way to
what the heck is flexnet ! ?
i dont know
sbuild just picks debian/control and installs everything declared in build-depends there
true
hey , what 's up with the overlay ppa ?
well , debian has worked towards this for a long time , so i 'd consider it a feature :
are you currently having issues with the speed ?
recently we 've seen quite a few hp laptops with this bug in their firmware
yep
remove that line
how ?
i look forward to seeing your miracast apps
yes , no
ok , can you write what you want in an email / task ? i am looking at another problem
ubuntu 14.04 with unity desktop ? ? ? etc
then blender does n't provide that file
this is 4.2
go to debian.com and download the full dvd 's it 's like 4-5 dvd or something with the 1st being

yeah not seen that one before

there is , yes . would it work ?
yeah , from your side . we were running on 36mb/s
true , but while docked , they are not windows any more , they are widgets drawn as part of
launchdetails in package/plugin.go
no , the 4 is n't a supported device .
adb reboot recovery got arale in the same `` static '' recovery to push the files
yes indeed
expected them to not overlap

i could

do n't know if the merge will work as it is now
having the abstract scopes interface ... yeah , ok
i still do not understand why you think it is non-sense ... it totally makes sense . you are the

the value we had for the images inside was preserveaspectfit , but never worked
hmmm okay
it happens when names are taken already . please stick to the purpose of this channel and not go off
aha !
yeah officially it 's a holiday but i 'm around for train stuff
what do i do ?
well , if it 's that a bunch failed to properly configure , good ol ' `` sudo dpkg --

been working quite a bit on juju-core recently for a change . just like old times : )
if 1 ) yes , 2 ) install lo ?
i. e. dist-upgrading an instance from say precise to trusty would n't be supported anyway
ok , i jumped at conclusion then . : )
yes
no
nope not that
check about kubuntu backports and beta backports ppa by googling
the initscripts are started / stopped via a mess of 14-odd symlinks in /etc/rc*.d/ directories , the snn and knn
there are some tools who try to defrag ntfs , but they are no real solution like the defrag that
they take > 7days when they scan me
thx for help
yeah it is . i 'll try
like we can guess that without any information ?
power off issue shoudl be fixed with 5.3.2
yes .
even when you fail your nth request , your n-1th one is still good , leaving you time to react
could n't we open rtm/15.04 , copy the touch parts of vivid into it , and then copy the ppa
here ya go , it 's bit dates , but if you wnat to change the fm , a few
sorry , but what is system 208 ?
silo approval is waiting for your feedback : )
how did you install it and what ubuntu version are you using ? ( btw that line appears to be
it works on teh local system using wget
no , that 's not how live cds work
press shift when booting
so do you know how to operate winetricks ?
what is a `` direct '' connection ? to a private bus ?
and you did the whole bit including the part after the semicolon ?
debug level log messages
that does explain your error though . `` /run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share : server=qnap.local , share=backup/data '' is nothing
right now you 're *outside* the normal directory tree , e.g . your $ path does not contain your usual
maybe the flue season : )
grub-install ( grub ) 2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1.6
yes thats what i posted originally about the random bunch of chars
correct
maybe check which you have added and consider removing some if they 're no longer necessary
did you *just* build that ?
a setting was changed recently which means 2fa is always requested for launchpad.net if you have a device activated .
from the marble discussion on some mailing list i got the impression we need libmarble for qt4
it 's using what it needs
have you tried other browsers , like chrome ?
tell you what , i 'll try connecting with esata on the other computer , then i 'll come back
so , wait . did you actually rebuild since timo 's trunk commit ?
i wiped ~/.cache/upstart/unity8.log before running the ap-test
i hope it was just that you used the right edge and forgot ... : -/
bq . but if they ship 1 ubuntu phone doesnt mean you can install ubuntu-touch on all their phones .
merging 3 line changes is my specialty ; )
do you have a 32bit or 64bit ubuntu ?
wow , that 's taking a long time
you can use route just fine
yeah , 37 degrees at the beach and stuff like that
from memory you can disable this
yep - shiny and squeaky
try a better phone with dualcore cpu and 512mb ram . runs very good imho
man pls
4.x is rather nice indeed .
i was asked the same ( very valid ) qustions that i had to send that mail ... but of
use the unrar command on cli
ok , i lied - its actually libressl
fixing the bot is a bit more work than i expected tbh
i know you 're not
efibootmgr -v , paste it in paste.ubuntu.com
haha = ) docker can use a lot of network setups , by default it 's quite crappy . and
out of curiosity , what was the exact command that you used which failed ?
they were green on the last two attempts : ) so i watch this landing with extra attention ...
i 'll keep poking
i have a branch ...
which project is that ?
ask your question , dont ask to ask : )
tyvm
the important thing to remember about sip is that it 's hopelessly broken ; once you 've got that in
what is your issue with x11-common ?
basically , the same issue ( the focus thing ) happens if you go in the dash , files lens
just a moment : )
i type out the changes i want and hit enter , and it just goes to the next line .
i was thinking of that . sh or /bin/bash or bash ?
about the translations in your diff -- did you say a bot did that automatically ? i did n't think
hey buddy , i did find this in dmesg : [ 7.151524 ] acpi warning : 0x0000000000000b00-0x0000000000000b07 systemio conflicts with

already suggested .
ok but if that was a vps sometimes those can be intercepted
i find it supprising they ar n't supported out of the box these days , they are anchient
so notice in __init__ , it puts the object in self.app . so we could pass ap the object directly
theres lots of hardware that doesnts support things
right now it 's just confusing the issue : ) try moving those two dsa files out of ~/.ssh for
if it 's a seagate drive did you use their drive test program . that 's the authoritative guide to
what is your problem exactly ?
yeah , i just started timing it actually ( dd if==/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda4 ) , once it 's done i 'll
you mean two dm ?
apw did it . looks like he put wily in kernel-ppa/mirror
no , see the history
let me look into that one .
xf86-input-wacom-lts-utopic
i do n't use it , so i ca n't say .
fixes can still go in 1.23 : )
bschaefer : bregma : it is just a prototype , though , meant for early feedback which we never got
as stated , discontinued . i seem to recall that there is an ubuntu engineer certification in the pipeline ,
just to clarify , there is no kde5 , that 's the way it was expained to me
then check out /etc/apache2/conf-available dir
btw why do you still have a qmlproject file and a cmakelist file ?
sounds like it 's firewalled , or you have routing issues .
i do n't have canonistack credentials here either , or any intention of using it
it will be detected and added with a fresh ubuntu install ,
pong
omg ahh
cron can be told to send an email
what results 'startxfce4 ' ?
sysctl net.ipv6.bindv6only returns what ?
^
exactly
yeah , that was an aside : p
so put them in the queue and start the conversion
ubuntu
for the two cases i know of , anyway , the build trees are just enormous .
i would for for a test no one is changing my writer test
dholbach the other option is to stage-package the library itself and not -dev ; but it makes it a nicer
why ? it gives me a soft landing : d work one day and back to not working : d
you 're sure ?
so it installed : mesa-utils right ?
do you know what in xenial is causing the ftfbs for address-book-app ? since i see silo 45 has address-book-app
what 's your opinion on us stabilising on just one release note ?
you added the repo . so what are you afraid about that it ships other/new versions ? if you dont
yeah , basically tmobile
cat only displays
why would you just not use a live ubuntu to get those files ?
try aptoncd maybe
probably , but kind of odd its such a low level package ?
sudo lshw -c video
would it be possible to take the same image and boot it in kvm or something beforehand ?
ok and `` sudo dpkg -r linux-image-extra-3.16.0-48-generic linux-image-extra-3.16.0-46-generic linux-image-extra-3.16.0-45-generic linux-image-extra-3.16.0-44-generic linux-image-extra-3.16.0-43-generic linux-image-extra-3.16.0-30-generic ''
i agree . and those are quite some .pngs ( all buttons times all states )
that is news - i had no idea about .env format before today
not in hexchat
i like it
ok ... now i 'm see the none object without ever seeing the assertion for the layout
i got my cubox running trusty , i 'm digging to put snappy there too
while you are mumbling , it 's your turn !
i need that in my script
i have no problem with that . the only part i have n't figure out is how to actually send
i do n't have a `` magical '' problem that needs solving .
april fools was yesterday , not today
can give me the zest of what is wanted ?
you 're still not making any sense
plz stop repeating
done
it looks like this build was triggered from a manual rebuild . is that correct ?
poke
would it get him to the bios ? or just a uefi shell or so ?
so that 's why we 're getting those warnings , i 'd bet
can you tell me what you are trying to install ? and where you got it form ?
look into ppa 's
everywhere 's cool in the winter . the garage should n't get too hot in summer because it 's at
which ubuntu ? what are you trying to do ? you need their repo and it has been called kodi
this is more a radeon issue though so ill ask them as well for good merits
14.04
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
and your server stuff is meant to be manged by `` server ways '' which means edit text-files or parameters
check the config options for irecord
do you have something similar in your syslog ?
although it 's possible it 's ignoring the target branch i guess
right , it 's just weird that it gets pulled in for them
i do , on my laptop , but my desktop runs critical scripts and stuff ... even rebooting takes me
ok , interesting ... first thing , note that technologypreference is not about changing the slot with 3g capabilities ,
right , i dont know yet what to do with wily changelogs or even where exactly point the bot to
where 's the fix in the url you posted ?
if you base on the git branch , we are using gbp-pq
ok
preinstalled by whom ?
oh and merry christmas to you and everyone else as well , even if a bit late by now
sorry , devscripts , not ubuntu-dev-tools
looking
ah , ok .
yep~
memory does n't use a lot of power
are you using a ssd ?
i ment what do you contribute to in the open source community >
i can stay connected on this computer whether i use usb on the other computer or not
not 100 % myself , but i googled for results there so just read some more of them maybe ?
i 'm strongly suggestion rethinking your concept of storing data .
that too .
mostly idle with some waiting
yes
aah . nice : )
just a wild guess . maybe root needs a password set on the server
pretend i already backed up . the system is too unstable to actually do it .
also : what exactly is not working : ) /me readingbacklog
of course , and there 's no helpful information there
almost done
yeah , nbut old hwe arent supported anymore , once a new hwe is out .
xnox was busy : )
ta !
^^^
train goes by mps , if the train is grabbing trunk it 's because your mp points at trunk .
hmm , i see . on what filesystem is the file located ?
ahh , i just used -- webappurlpatterns=
and output of execution of /usr/share/ofono/scripts/list-contexts
for now i am resorting to using runners but would rather use dependency engine
then just run sudo efibootmgr -v again and check that the order has changed
remember to precede the fdisk -l command with sudo
i doubt it : p
fwiw this only happens once per environment
well , quite a lot of tools and messages on the ml , so interesting to see where this is
those square corners were there before , it 's a window manager issue
i like to try , what version , 15.10 ?
yes of course
are you testing on arale or on krillin ?
k , will do
i 'll just go ahead with my verification and cross my fingers .
do any of those exist in -proposed at higher versions ?
no application . im using idea and it auto-detects . i 'm just curious where $ java_home went and how
so , core depends on xdg-utils and recommends software-properties-gtk , while desktop depends on software-prop , and recommends xdg-utils .
will it copy even if the windows machine is all encrypted etc ?
i suggest maximum amount of ram you can stuff into a machine but that 's just me ...
yup . and we will help wherever we can : )
let me test with android , see if it switches off
did n't understand
im guessing its version 5 ( assuming that is what is shipped with kubuntu 15.10 ? )
the server is linux , right ?
bazhang what i am saying is it would require me to redownload and install all my apps
ok !
to get firefox 36 from repository .
nah , i 'll push it in cvs
ok let me try a few things here
i can change it back so the clientservermethods methods are methods of client instead if you like
and this is why we kindly accept sudormrf 's advice but do n't act on it ; )
hell xtrabet . my name is tjbiddle . what is your task for me ? type help for a list
yeah , will add that to my list
yes sorry , i removed meta-kde but i 've put it back now with only kde-sc-dev-latest
( just in case you thought things were ok : -p )
what is that ?
please describe what you see when you try to boot .
nor i , but that 's what it 'd be if it 's not autocutsel
right , what os did you make the flash drive from ?
for sure , but you can mark it as [ linux-any ]
so feel free to continue with me , although i see your problem sounds like something that needs a bit
^
oh right umm -faces palms- i removed it : (
you can also install multiple desktop environments on the same system , and choose which one every login
is the pc working right now ?
i see you in the meeting which is odd ... now 2 of you : p

heya
i 'm now running on 3.19.0-26-generic
nomodeset is only before x is loaded , apparently
cat /sys/class/leds/ $ led/trigger
and you checked the software repo ? for the easy way . ' apt-cache show node.js ' .
bb2min
qml seems the best solution . it will be a header with two actionbars and some title .
so you have it added now ?
that code as missing would only have failed to report a failed state
do i just format the whole disk ? it looks like it was a windows recovery
yep
ok , on the page there is says about 12.10 deadline
going slow , but i 'm leaning a lot : d
hm , good point
no snow yet , dark clouds tho
what cisco is it ?
what 's the jes upgrade bug ?
c2d
then yes , it goes to charge mode automatically
thats ... odd . which version of ubuntu/openstack installer ?
haha
how do i turn on debugging ?
are you a developer ?
the bug is in all versions up to debian/sid
i prefer to use ldap in this case , but if it 's just your ubuntu system and one other
hmm ... somehow i need the main uitk source in the silo
did you run sudo apt-get update first
`` no connection '' is far too vage . connection from where to where , using which tools , how

... or we pick `` the biggest '' monitor and window the others .
reboot , at the grub menu select memtest instead of booting into ubuntu
would the unity8 version installed this way write it 's logs in adt-run 's tmp directory or the usual place
14.04 ?
only specific mtp folders are shown by default
no , that 's a commandline app . i 'm looking for the gui one you get when you press
so how many passes of memtest did you run ?
yeah , looked at that , it was n't scanned yet . well , cdg efficiency : p
no ... noo nooooooooooooooooooooo
do we have any design on that ?
launchpad does n't seem to have updated yet though
how much is enough ?
alternatively , you can use an exploit . i have a syncthing app on the store which does n't spawn

why costing ?
fair point . jibel 's looking at it .

maybe copying /etc/users and /etc/shadow will be enough
what is line 5
do you know where scarlett have 5.3.2 builds for vivid ?
or is it desirable to have things building with c++11 ?
ty very much for clearing that .
try the xda forums for existing projects or check the porting guide wiki
its to have access and fix from there and then go back to unity ... . trust me i do
i believe it 's wildly unmaintained .
oh , nice : )
anymore info that needs to be on that report ?
i do n't recognise the term `` stub '' from normal go idioms

then no
ok i 'll pester voidspace . need some help with the vanguard issue ^^
you shouldnt be logged in , or able to log in as root
you got a lot of false advice so far . so what are you doing there at all ?
yeah , there is a open bug about this iirc , jdstrand discussed that some days ago , the apparmor

yeah we 're waiting mainly for review from victor , but it would be nice to have the clock side
i asked to sil2100 , that 's why i did that
if it does , it 's not a big deal
and you 'd better copy every command you type out into a text file so that i can see what

it would probably cause builders to fail to reset . that does happen occasionally
maybe something like this ?
if you have only one copy of your file on a hard drive , and someone zeroes that hard drive

you mean ff starts up in the state you described ?

dont doubt it at all . *actually* test that , and you 'll see

can you paste the entire unit log ? did the pip install path.py not work ?

sure , i will post it the mailing list
install what ?
or you could have raid 6 with hot spares . that would probably be fine too
fsck /dev/sdx
so maybe in dahdi-linux itself
listen to it now , what does it sound like ?
so it 's awesome from a lib developer standpoint , but a pita for a bundle writer/user standpoint as it
i just use stock opensuse and shorewall
it would mean we can publish a liberty bundle earlier than we might with just /next branches

can you give the exact wording when it asks for the files are kept ? it may want an installation

how ? browser ?
1. skip that test in schroot ; 2. turn off logs in that panic test
if you 've edited grub previously then ubiquity checks for changes t grub before it iinstalls a new unedited one

what does `` ls -latr /lib/modules/ '' report ?
your branch does n't merge fine on the vcs , there is a conflict in 06_uoa.patch

yes , there 's a blacklist
yes

ah , i care slightly less about that , i was talking instead about the actions.yaml file format

so i see this branch was releasing wily packages ( probably dual landed ) , and now it got switched
after reboot it will pre-load your packages to boost up a little

why did you choose 'manual ' then ?

not our concern .
this isnt a fedora channel .

exactly what i said before , fix the dependencies
nope , you guys confirmed my thoughs
yes .
that 's your next step - if it truly is a bug you should file one , unless a bug

not necessarily true . just because the bios wo n't allow booting device xyz , that does n't mean that

does the updater require anything other than port 80/443 ?

how would i know if i should enable it or not ? any way to tell what 's in it
ah . error .
we have 4 unit test failures blocking ci . we 'll look into the maas i386 one . can someone

?
i do n't have windows os . i have another notebook also running `` ubuntu 14.04.2 lts '' and it
ditto .

it does n't seem to have lines for specific mounts , i guess it 's under the gvfs entry
if you are lucky `` sudo apt-get autoremove '' should remove old kernels
well not for too long
agreed . now that i can auto-generate api client 's it can be trivial
have you ever ran linux on it ? has it booted linux live iso 's ?

oh , okay .
that says quite clearly ^
i have tried on rather low specs , or use a netinstaller-cd and then choose expert mode , but idk..
i do n't see why not . it 's just pointing at the primary archive today .
yes start with the tar again , i 've no idea what start your code is currently in
that might have been it .
oh , so what about org.freedesktop.dbus.introspectable ?
did you move the ha card ?
in which sense ?
ah , there used to be a comma there ... : - )
also , the first thing i did when joining was resuming my support session where i left it out
ok , and can you see the data in /media/sda1
yeah . if you 're just adding new translations , that can really happen any time . it 's new
done
why ?
ungood .. pastebin that output !
no worries , no replies came in so far
late response . i have restarted whole server and now installing new server fresh
i really liked plasma5 when i tried it but there were few bugs in there that made me decide that
with phablet-test-run
ok - so i grabbed /next and did a 3 unit deploy
no ? we wo n't nominate a new one until immediately afterthe last one expires
but you did n't pass it do ubuntu-device-flash
ubuntu is real os
i 'm not seeing that , anything in the log ? ~/.cache/upstart/application-click-com.ubuntu.camera_ < version > .log
you can install lts , so kubuntu 14.04

so the answer is 'no '
well here 's the thing . the api 's been in a neutered state for a long time now .
oh , you built yourself , locally ? well , on a desktop ubuntu a different set of tests fail
also , make has a working dependency engine , it makes a lot of difference when you iterate , just

what i did was to run that single test with -- shell , then ssh in and run the test

you can always uninstall packages ( ppa-purge is the tool to use to remove ppas completely , including reverting back

api versioning is used in a very strict sense here . if we branch something as `` v5 '' then
yes : sudo : apt-add-repository : command not found
i just saw it once ; have n't tried again
what is the problem ?
that explains it ! can you check this exists and contains the nameserver line i showed : `` cat /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf
can you try on your wily box to `` from gi.repository import glib , gio '' ?
ca n't be done

it moved to kinfocenter which is where it logically should be but is a bit more hidden alas

meet at a coffee shop , preferably without a laptop , to introduce new folks to the ubuntu community
sure
but it also breaks the multi-env layer because you have to pay attention to that field all the time
o/
or your go version is too old ?
yep its fine !
you 're starting from existing bluedevil packages presumably ?
i 'm using export gopath= '' $ ( pwd ) '' to download the code in this temp dir for
it is . just trying to figure out what 's best for the average user
ok , try sudo apt-get install -- reinstall xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-radeon
its cheap if its work : )
that was exactly the command i needed , perfect ! thx a bunch
check /var/log/mail.log for instance
it might be useful if qa checked the ppa contents so that it does not have a `` grey ''
oh , not yet , let me finish up my current branch and then try that .
the codes above ?
i can boot from the cli and many other reinstall grub plans , i just have suoergrub in a flash
yeah..blank screen after the ubuntu logo ...
there are example shell scripts on the net
and then you have parts of the linux community that says : dont use closed source drivers at all .
it correct the problem is not with konversation
i mean the hangouts window
but again this is me being a cranky qe : )
again we hit freeze and things incomplete a little , did anything happen with gedit and nautilus
i have ...
so if the test fails for you in ci tests , that 's the change you want
wait you injured your arm , how is it now ?
i 'll gather the info .
if it is in the android hal it could get that ... though the time management is usually done via
that seems entirely untrue , what is this claim based on ?
it starts normally
two machines , one nic each , one ip each , each in a different subnet in the same env
really ?
try the same with tail -f /var/log/dmesg maybe
it expresses intended use , not aws-specific thing
a lenovo y40 notebook
cheers
yea , if it was pushed to a different branch name it would work
if you get the answer , can you write it down or something and send it to me ? i
that should work unless the kernel was updated , in which case you could check thier website
maybe
though if you 're french , it 's probably for the better xd
as a useless data point , i 've never seen the bug on any of my machines , ever .
hold on . will read .
tell us your device first like xangua asked please
all green but that does not necessarily mean they are done .
there is no valid answer
please stop with the off topic chat , i have directed you to join # linux
yes , or just run `` sudo blkid | pastebinit '' to pastebin the entire output easily .
if i use one screen than it wil be ok
yeah , no dice . it 's like it 's getting `` repaird '' or something when i restart
permissions are 644. i can wget the file from the machine having problems
sounds reasonable
it has to do with the new uniter code
we have a rather extensive set of qml tests
maybe file a bug report against that release
drop it .
i dunno
i do n't think you ever worked on a core app did you ?
ok , i 'll be waiting for the new packages to land and then i 'll add the feedback
well , this may hopefully get solved when charles will start the new alarm backend : )
hmm , somehow missed the scrollback on it ( unless it was -ot ) , but wiki sent me a
it just accepts entities and returns their statuses
still .sideload will be a thorn
germinate 's not always bright in the face of alternate deps .
ah no !
why did you say `` onboard fakeraid == software raid '' ?
are they running ? dd they compile ? lsmod |grep -i nvidia
you ca n't grow a raid10 ... which sucks
it 's a bit large , but mostly due to heavy testing : )
yeah , in general they prefer to work the other way
that 's the point . the definitions are in my bashrc , and i could n't find the name of
will this work slider.select_single ( '__styleinstance ' ) .select_single ( 'thumb ' ) ?
it 's fixed , you did n't have a branch for that did you ?
type sudo cfdisk /dev/sda
should be removed , but both would work
is there a way to get exact message why it thinks it ca n't be authenticated ?
we recommend that , yes . but it 's possible to skip
if pax are getting handed parachutes on final approach , requirements on the ground are easier to fulfill , i
ppa 's safety is at your own discretion
devops should gain you some hours : /
although not in the same way
no way to `` cache '' the deltes soo they happen automagically when dekko is next brought to foreground ?
look online instead they have stuff in all the time that is n't in the paper catalogue
i 'm certainly no expert in server setup so perhaps the guys in # ubuntu-server can help out
and i ca n't find where the propertieschanged event is emitted for networkmanager . i see the generic dbus properties
source contents , yes , binary contents - no , different dependencies
it 's cancelling the foreground , too ?
yes i am
i am running it with sudo -e
or is it something else than that
third party docks - like awn or cairo dock
do what you were doing 1. land your pr against master , 2. rebase your branch against 1.23 3. force-push
but then teh development snapshot link shows 14.01 as well ... ..
during 15.10 or in early 16.04 ... 15.10 is not supposed to end up on any devices for that reason
it 's a task in urgent
i cant run apt-get upgrade either with out getting `` unmet dependencies . try using -f. '' error and then
do n't listen to me too much , i 'm `` through the wind '' today : p
what you 'll do best with , is , simply remove plank from the equation , right now , and
you 're looking for mouse or touch event generation ?
i dont know about host , whatever is default with ubuntu utopic
ask again on another time , better luck perhaps
i remember the user 's password
the whole idea of mimic is to prevent others from knowing what i 'm really using .
you are wise : )
ok
he 's been there since 2015-02-22 20:11:09
do n't care about the backround
the clone away , verify the good copy before you destroy the old copy
i can only set the browser , mail reader , file manager , and terminal emulator there ... how can
would be good to check it also in arale
is this `` double chroot '' right ? chroot chroot/ update-initramfs -u -k $ ( version )
then just use that ?
end kernel panic - not syncing : vgs : unable to mount root fs on unknown-block ( 0,0 )
so it installs
try echo $ path > /tmp/path in the script itself
oh there is a small change in the .service file
/root/.android 769mb ... looks like you 've been using android studio as root
i 've no idea about support for chromebook hardware . installing stuff on a phone is problematic . maybe this
b where 5 is the windows entry
what would you propose ?
verily . .o
just omit the second argument
that can be due to a gpu driver..
yeah , pretty sure that requires the content_exchange_source permissions
what is the version number ? 176 ?
to get a scope for whatsapp ?
was it just released today ? i install updates every morning , as i have some daily ppas
cool !
i take it the next image will have both clock and reminders ?
cool tx
nope
on this idea of closing apps , any chance you 've looked at associated screen shots in spread
k , that 's what i did
gksu nautilus is n't harmful
sent
only seens that sentence with three points , so jumped on the wagon to quickly ; )
cool .
i still get that error even with -- pub-key
i generally prefer it to be explicit , since it 's a one-liner .
yeah : -/
! ! ! ouch .. we are in the /home directory .. no sudo !
the only time i boot someone else 's image is if i 'm trying to see if issues we see
jeez , that 's awful . im so sorry : (
looked in params , it seems the api layer just json marshals the struct directly
dude , join # xrdp
i like the arp search that yours does .
the update translation commit seems wrong
fine , you ? you need help on ap ?
you mean the bnc ?
what are you using yours for ?
looks like there 's some lightdm configuration you have to do to allow manual user logins .
nm can save connections for the entire system , or just for the current user .
wily
that 's what i 'm doing in my prototype now
which version of kubuntu is this ?
what kind of plans do you have with the infrared
anyway the apt-get is pulling nvidia-331 from ubuntu updates .
352.63 ( recommended ) .
i tried to apply sane defaults everywhere to type less
can i ask what that does before i go ahead and run it ? i have to be careful i
could be . i do n't feel that the bug is reported well enough to know .
if you use ubuntulistview , that will have removedisplaced animation
hmmm
ty
heh we just say that a lot , but we do n't really care .
ok , does the login screen restart ? or does it say wrong password ?
no , cp its a uefi usb so i have a load of iso 's and grub.cfg menu , all
if you have the menu button is the 8th item in the menu under show in groups
you devil ! ; d
: i must change the bios setting ?
so , channel ubuntu-rtm/14.09-factory-proposed has a new release candidate for ota-4
contact the ppa maintainer for help with a more recent version
fantastic . let me know when those bugs are filed
see my 2 others patches in the same dir : )
which one ?
i already tried firefox and google chrome
no idea . what would that have to do with anything ?
i did that
running the terminal .
please do n't ask to ask a question , simply ask the question ( all on one line and in
i do n't see any bios settings to turn it off
that said people in the xubuntu team might be looking personally
ack , we know what needs to be done and where , it 's only a matter of deciding on
that looks nice
wonderful !
then we 'll land separately
but not for sandbox - as soon as i import the bundle it looses its placement data
there are other two errors , failover zerosize initrd ( removing the check for mode=try works fine ) and initramfs
though shaun vn was `` i 'll never use linux on my desktop ! ''
sure , do you put that in debian/rules
on it . oh and dmesg doe n't complain about the drive either
he 's long gone .
what is the `` correct way '' via the store to install usbutils ?
pastebinit /var/log/xorg.0.log will also work .
if that is the case , check the ownership/perms of the directory : `` ls -al /home/jonathon/nas/ '' - it
does n't look like it , not if you use themes ( theme vs. theme )
rvr is trying to validate latest awe_ 's changes to see if that affected or not modem manager
try it with apt-get install -- no-install-recommends cacti
you 're not alone there
it is . : )
but on canonistack ?
but this might be not related to your suspend
yeah
stay on topic please
we 're not even remotely close to releasing today , proposed will be off before candidates happen .
it looks suspicious
and more to point , it 's only the domain , so it does n't look at the path .
oh sorry was thinking scientific , ha
the only thing i can suggest is systemrescue disk or boot-repair
interesting . i wounder why : d
i dont really follow .
ok great , probably in a hour or so
or repeat your issue in here @ more crowdy timezones
we 're all part of the community : )
try sudo login < your user >
hmm command not found . copied straight off
use it just to test the issue
so which parameters do you pass ?
you have installed kubuntu 15.04 ?
yes , some of the objects are a little fun
happy new year dude : )
i have an alias set alias git-buildpackage-real='git-buildpackage -- git-ignore-branch -- git-no-create-orig -- git-ignore-new -s '
sorry , my question is even more basic
coming
even so , what do i connect to the serial end of the adapter ?
after that is done sudo service lightdm restart and try to login
so i install grub in /dev/sdb2 fat32 boot ? right ?
how do i do that ?
all u.unitag does is wrap names.newunittag ( u.name ( ) )
great !
np , had to flash anyway
freenode does n't have vhosts , instead it has cloaks
naughty ? why ?
k
or leave them there and unzip from .trash
me ?
a friend of mine is working on a machine that will make usb thumb drives with linux on it
echo thing | sudo tee > file ( you missed the > )
on my maas the static range starts at 172.16.0.4
there 's only one ...
uname -a | nc termbin.com 9999
you are just opening a can of worms here : - )
are you taking the piss ?
you know about sru and friends , right ?
lets see if we can bootstrap you out of there : `` set root=hd0 , msdos5 '' and `` set
: ) for removing the includeshell code , i 'll push it shortly
perfect !
sure
according to `` man mysql '' ... `` -- user=user_name , -u user_name ''
yes
well , that 's the other issue with pybuild . i have to ask piotr , and from the start
you should still run the entire command you mentioned above , or put it in the crontab for the user
run `` lspci -k '' and `` ip link '' , share output on pastebin
sorry.. just not familiar with the tools as i have n't had to use them in a long time
do i have to wait or can i update it myself without risking to break my system ?
hey !
yes , but it wont remember that selection , next time i reboot it goes back to capture device
if it 's fine to not fix it now , it 's also ok
no problem . that one offers a solution , but best to read around the other search results to get
i do n't really use kmail ; )
bad luck : (
oh it 's in the comment
do you know what client you are using ?
average lead time on a train sru is typically 2 months
hangout to chat about it ?
why ?
no , neither that
i want yaml
if i copy from ntfs to ntfs on windows , it works . if i copy from ext4- > ext4
all right . that were about all of my concerns xd
just so you know , oxide-qt is a different problem
i never said i installed it like that . i said that it was on those partitions in a raid
ok ill try that 340 now
also check your additional drivers section
do `` sudo mkdir /target ; sudo mount /dev/mapper/ubuntu -- vg-root /target ''
provided you run it with superuser privileges , it 'll report `` configuration : driver= ... '' for those devices
what ?
live usb worked
yeah , but may as well make it work anyway . : p
frankly , `` refocus '' should never happen
oh , you are right
i was able to get it to work btw when i tried a different framework
any ideas if/how i might circumvent this ? i will just install in legacy bios mode otherwise , i just
try lspci -v and look for network and find the line : kernel driver in use
also , silo 044 is ready to be published and i do n't have permission to do so , i
yeap struggling to connect from my server
^
one would generally use 5.2.0~rc5 . '~ ' < ''
no
i 'll need a list of all files lightdm ( and other lightdm-related packages ) have installed on your system
to unhide it in nautilus use ctrl-h
things like /var/ ( 16 gb ) are useless while moving to debian ?
greyback_ sorry : )
: )
great , i will hold off on that until then ; - )
yes with the code pstolowski just did
yeah yeah , but until vivid phone images are official , that 's all i care about : )
let me update the bug with the command line . i used any of us can run it . it
hopefully ... let me know how it goes
nvidia
am i free to create one kilos ?
is here too great let 's rock 'n roll
yes
haha
right , so it is what i said
no , i do n't . have a link ?
can you choose the guest account on the login screen ? does that work ?
and indeed if i do locate qstorageinfo i have nothing
nothing happened after the purge nvidia* . get to the same screen with several green [ ok ]
well , we are right now , in the `` neener neener no apparmor for you '' sense
cool
yes in 2.7
to the 1st . no changes to qemu.conf . i worked around the issue by moving the image to /var/lib/libvirt/images/
no browser is safe , all of em are prone to attacks
if you do n't intend to downgrade from lts-v to 3.16 or 3.13 ever again , you can do that
i 'm in the hangout
or ual , or whatever actually tries to talk to it , yes
ah ok , `` known one '' , good : )
but maybe that is related to the userspace mouting of the drive ? i 'll check what happens when i
i looked extensviely for such an animal and i could not see anything , but i will check again
nope .
want me to copy/set up setup-testbed and setup-lxc for now ?
thinking about it , i did n't start it on my amd card previously . i 've got the same
i hear a distant cracker crumbling and the sound of a cracking cheese gromit !
we ca n't provide such a thing reliably , so we do n't . we were going to provide gu
i 'll check that in a minute , just fixing the emulator builds now ; )
essentially you might have worse luck with either browser on html5 only , or flash player based youtube
those which i run with service < service > start
only difference is uncommenting the line 26 which did not help
oh , i forgot . i did this because it was hard to find the test that was failing for
according to packages.ubuntu.com , the package is named qtchooser - if you are using 14.04
hmm that sounds like a bug . try putting a random character in each field and hit save . that
did your pc come with windows preinstalled
assuming installing the nvidia drivers would be wrong ?
not real enthusuaistic about it so far ... missing some of my fav features and one has been droppe ,
yes , i was able to confirm that after seeing your bug report and came here looking for the answer
well i can try it on my on machine , entering a bad password . i 'm pretty sure there
if it 's armhf-only , i would guess only by chance .
i just thought we might as it does n't source /etc/network/interfaces.d
weird . okay , worth a shot . since the problem is intermittant , and i ca n't reproduce it
the problem with the just0skip-it approach
if it goes into the image we do monitor those
xenial is comming in april 2016
do you have your rpi2 with snappy installed ?
pleia2 is in charge of that , so pm her or go to # ubuntu-news if you have a question
huh ?
wait a second . can i check something before you approve
kde applications includes some updates that are not versioned 14.12
done , no errors so far
hahaha , luckily all filesystems are operation , its just a disk that finally went boom .
14.10 simply does not work on this laptop at all . it wo n't even boot up to a login
how does kubuntu-archive-upload work for you ?
but we can talk later
might require some tail chasing of deps , but you will get it eventually .
linode has 5 . by that error , looks like co.za needs all of them if they 're there
for the *api* not to hang ?
okay , that works .
i know it does .
that 's odd , it 's supposed to be a live session
3 seconds ! that 'll be sweet
ty !
exactly what you said before
i 've been there : - )
the main view is transparent
they 're doing software installs *shrug* not much you can do about it..
latency ? is that pci latency ? that 's usually 32 or 64
anything else you wanted to talk about now ?
good night !
^
yeah it was early 4
i see what you mean
i thought larry 's issue was an lxc container problem ...
and ?
ok , type sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
is already fighting keybinding and scrollbars did n't change
lubuntu and xubuntu *are* ubuntu.. same kernel , same drivers.. same plumbing . same repos
dunno , maybe ask in # ubuntu-server too ?
possible . maybe you could try to verify the issue with a live cd
i find that via grep : `` /etc/x11/xsession.options:8 : use-ssh-agent ''
as it is with all active directorys . you need dns . i 'm using openldap and bind9 on the
you should also rest . i 'm here only because i slept all evening : d
she knows my priorities
uefi is efi , as opposed to legacy
so ... finally your branch landed : )
when i run any of those commands with -d option i get a bunch of output - it can connect
how did that package get through review ?
np
ok
so we need a code change in settings ?
is fastboot a setting in windows
no
the problem is that it 's always disabled atm
no . codecs . you need the restricted/non-free codecs to enable .mp3/4
i 'd have thought so
i use windows and grow up .
thx
nope
really ? that 's a bit surprising
we 'll most likely change the address allocation with juju-br0 to use the maas devices api to tell maas as
i 'm not the gpl 's biggest fan , but i will admit that it accidentally led to some very
i did upload a tarball one year ago and they seem to have completely removed the project
what ? lid close not suspending ?
yeah , part of the issue is if you relocate the database to another device for instance ( with different

sure
we do n't make hardware
any next instructions ?
hdmi ?
ok , try sudo blkid | nc termbin.com 9999
line 422
which ubuntu release ?
yea , yea , lts pfffffft ! : )
hmm , you could be right . maiatoday has quite the wiki page
it lists your partions
for node-snapper i still have to talk to ogra_
k , i 'll try to get it added
no ; it 's broken now , so you 'll need another working environment ( live iso ) in order
i 've been told that ubuntu touch can be run in the emulator that comes with the ubuntu-sdk package
with the store i get some binary blob . there is no way to verify that it has not been

so go unplug it and plug it back in .
is it running ?
i also tried sudo apt-get install usb-modeswitch
they 'll be marked on the tracker one way or the other tomorrow : )
fixed . seems like we had n't changed the translation focus when we opened vivid translations a while ago
i know . emailed caio , mike and jacek
ok.. never mind : )
i would swapoff , reformat it potentially , check /etc/fstab for additional swaps
no warnings when running update-grub - i have all timeouts set to 0
i 'm trying again with 2m , then i 'll do 1m if it still does n't work . anyway
yeah , probably no . otoh , you 'll be able to move ownership around
oh wait , i get it ; the call with -- local changes self.dsmode . okay .
is n't that the recommended setup for magento ?
lvm by any chance ?
so what are you trying to do ?
btw , if you had downloaded a new .iso image you could already be installing your new system ...
+ !
just delete it
you removed a part at the end of `` when to change your password '' , didnt you ?
watch bahubali movie : )
hang on , let me rerun things with the new install script
i fixed one of your other patches too , which was missing a trailing line , and ran update-maintainer .
for reasons of efficiency ?
`` searching in the dash ''
things are very broken otherwise , system goes up in load due to multipath-tools being called repeatedly on the devices
let me take a look deeper , i 'm in a meeting so it might take a few more minutes
yes i do .
hey so , since we agreed that updating any scope that 's in the store should go through qa ,
some things may not work on platfirms , which are d-bus based , but we are going to find a
is it the same files each time ?
nectar722 is it worth creating a second user to test ?
just the bug fix , really
yeah , it does .
pmcgowan , i 've reported bug 1410506 , if i find any more info/steps i 'll add it to the
so , home filesystem is where owncloud stores data ?
yes , so i see
yeah , but should n't platform 2 be rebuilt against new mir ? or has there been incompatibilities ?
you dont get updates while using the lts . new versions can change things so the system looses stability or
also true .
yeah i figured : p
you ca n't just copy package files into the iso
i search
because the key was no longer present in your apt keychain for some reason ?
tbh i have n't gotten that far . definitely will have some unit tests , and then i 'd have
still not completely sure what causes it
it is
i 'm getting at using gparted to make them , then simply use them
yes because that sets a bad precedent , other folks are going to ask them to merge their changes while

it 's actually not my code - it happens in the usb4java library ( which basically is based on a

the problem is : the notifications themselves are in unity ( which is not running in testability mode by default
so are you currently trying to boot this system , access its luks encrypted root fs from a livecd/usb ,
i agree , but that 's not always possible

you can use the joyent creds from lp : cloud-city

look into everywhere that 's in $ xdg_data_dirs
nope

can you do `` dmraid -i -si -ct /dev/mapper/pdc_daeacifccf ''
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
good work
standard its listens to port 22
that was going to come next if the rfcs suggested it should be longer and i thought it was an
ah yes i did : )
yeah other branches are dying in ci too . not something likely to be fixed quickly
go with not ciing it then , just copy it over from ~jr to ~kubuntu-ci
however
were any packaging changes necessary to fix the boottest issues ?
after wiping the phone , do you still see history being started automatically after reboot ?
or ill host a deb if i can get it to build
so , in theory , if we really needed to , we could keep the client 1.2.1 compatible , but
but how do you really feel ?
that makes one of us : )
handle things like pulling in a runtime and packaging it along with your app .
so wily overlay ppa is just a holding spot until wily+1 opens so we can send packages there .
no , but with phone driven tokens for irc support : )
i.e . i would expect the lp api to tell you `` is this person allowed to upload this non-existent

i was just disabling it in unstable
i 'm abroad travelling all of next week , so i wo n't make it either way i guess
hmm yeah one for each test ... hmm
i said `` ip route ''
how we `` fix '' undernet ?
we sort of have , we have libnss-extrasusers on the image , we just have no mechanism that can write
very cool
oh yeah ? : s
dist-upgrade just upgrades your existing packages , it 's not a release upgrade
ok , type exit then restar
^^ just tried that . it 's exactly the same .
will wait until dropbox stops syncing
and let us know if it worked
then why does the changelog still say '0.0.5-0ubuntu1 ' when i look at the merge ? : -p
btw , i was thinking if something like route entry or iptables entry would have for this problem
maybe . 3.19 is well-tested and known-good . 4.2 only has the sort of light testing one gets during development
they also slightly changed the prompt string , hmm

why not ?
shimmer is probably fine here , for every other new gtk3 version , we have to make a lot of
lp : # 1498595
oh ... yeah , that branch is only fixing ./build.sh
so you making are here for making games for ubuntu ?
ok , good ... what about the first half of the question ? ; - )
so python xckd server also has no port open
when should it be prompting you mean ?
nice , that does make for a better signal/noise ratio
have you tried to run an update ?
yeah gim me the command lol
i see
however , i can see your point as well - and makes sense
yeah - dpkg-parsechangelog -s is not supported on 14.04 - a number of packages use it to determine oslo_package_version
ok
as you can see , same answer in a different channel .
i already hit merge anyway : p
yes , re-running apport should do be enough ( i guess ... )
yeah but on startup of the iso

boost1.58 ? is this run against the silo 16 ?
are you sure they 'll let you leave ?
any first step suggestions ?
do you have any usb wifi dongle
there are ways around it , like adding a drop-in for systemd-remount-fs.service to also make /writable r/w instead of remounting
ok
yeah .
not file by file , that 's only if it 's already written to the usb
is it reasonable to use snapcraft to pull in pulseaudio
mhall119 , balloons , popey : who 's doing the q & a today ?
for ubuntu or windows ?
the installer has an entry for picking /dev/sdx to put it on
kaccounts-integration stable is w/o akonadi
well you dont know how things work ; )
why the uniter seems to be always waiting to lose leadership at the first time modeabide is entered ?
bios says no bootable media found .
sorry irc client crashed
oh you mean you have one silo for qtmir that 's ready and one for unity8 that 's ready ?
they are n't

fortunately they 're pretty easy to replace . ssds are reasonable too .
i 'm just off to exercise , so just waving as i go ...
excelent ! : d i watting your response ! : d
what 's vdr ?
what you 're trying to accomplish
trunk is our development , we release into 1.5 branches etc .
so you added it to xorg.conf before , and now xorg.conf is missing ?
much appreciated !
maybe so
from xterm can you launch gnome terminal
ok , type sudo parted -l | nc termbin.com 9999
approved

just over ssh/scp
i do n't see precise ignoring it at all ...

feel free to come up with your own workitem though if you ca n't find a fit ; ) (
can you do a hangout ?
no problem
kf57 needs poking
yes , but they do n't need a lot of updates .

would you run your eye over kphotoalbum when you get a chance
i guess that 's good sign for ubuntu on phones : d
the advertised solution is to use static ip addresses but i do n't think you can do that for 1.8
i 'll take a peek
how are you launching your app ?
they do n't
should have all of them now
you updated some stuff , but it does n't require it , does it ?
try sudo apt-get update
1600 utc ?
it wont get as much attention as the retail devices
how do we know , given that people ca n't report them ? ; )
it says `` ubuntu will always be free of charge '' . does it mean we only have one ubuntu
i use sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
snappy config ubuntu-core | grep autoupdate does not return anything
try # gnome
that doc was last updated in dec 2004
those translation files should be in kwin-decoration-oxygen but kwin-decoration-oxygen no longer exists so they are correctly listed in list missing
does /etc/lsb-release say vivid ?
i also searched for an app something called kvkbd , i could n't find it
well , we 're lts only on ppc , so it 's been mostly ok
for your purposes i recommend marionnet
would you ? xx
did you see the bug with the reproducer ?
hey remember i was trying to change the interface earlier today
appart from being a very slow machine , yes .
can your phone browse network shares ?
well , good catch : )
: )
url ?
3.16 is newer than 3.5
also nothing obvious in the syslog
i need performance : )
i usually compare the md5/sha256 checksum to the published checksums found on ubuntu website
without the ack it would en up in unapproved , but might get rejected due to lack of infromation etc
so in summary the use_description_for_commit thing is a bug probably but does n't impact on the outcome of the job
the network is a bottle-neck for the quality , no matter what os you are using..
i 'm referring to 15.04 ppas here , not older releaeses

i can loop mount the img on desktop , but not the sdcard ( but i guess that 's expected

ah . good ! !
my other kubuntu box is a 14.04 and it has kde4

update-grub
i had a 14.10 with a kde-full . now i 'm after do-dist-upgrade and seems that the packages are bit
i wish i knew so i can break it less often
that 's fine . i 'd like to figure this out for next time though
look at your routing table , 192.168.3.0/24 is defined .
or on the parts wiki ; - )
s/the rest of //
i wish that was true , i 'd install kde4/plasma4 immediately if i could on 15.10 or even 16.04
okay so you have a 200+ gig encrypted partition ... .and then you have a 40 gig new home folder

no , bumblebee is outdated

i need it to access .onion sites .
how are you running out of space ?
no
ok : )
nopasswd is bad i got told
there you go . open the tar.gz and see

so , what is your plan ?
no not really , sorry
you 're here also ?
my question is how do you get the window system up and running using vbox ( is it possible )
there 's a .deb file you download from the sublime site . you can double-click on it , once you
do you know maybe , if it can cause bootloop ?
yeah : )
okay , so you will have run regular , and run tests .
and with the new sdk release , maybe what we 're doing has been made much much simpler

currently as vim.nox
i meant vivid , got confused because looking at a bug that is talking about vivid-proposed which does n't seem
but then nothing changes ... that was the only change in your mp , was n't it ?
no , i meant the comment in the mp
by that i meant less space that is n't used for anything

ok
with -s
i was trying to run the test you created
oh..yeah , could be qtmir maybe
you are european tz today ? ; - )
cool - how do you run it ?
can you clarify why you want this ? is it because you 're worried about packages in this list having
same : /
how do i create an extended partition ?
removing the bash made it stop working
install qt5-default
it does n't nor did i say it did . i am trying to connect to wireless networks and run
yes , indeed
i wrote the bot : )

sure.. you should just carry that worry over to normal computer maintenance , and plan for *when* the hardware fails
if an old fix works then maybe it is the same problem
perhaps..
no , this is my first time in the irc

the same output

it 's just temporary anyway , not worth setting up another ppa

i imagine i can ask a ppa to do that right ?
was it working before you updating ?
yeah =/
and what you intend to do on the vm . it will use swap when no ram is available .
echo -n `` sometext '' > somefile & & crc32 somefile & & rm somefile
i mean : reomve all programs from your ppa , remove the ppa ?
are you involved in debian/ubuntu development ? maintaining a couple of packages , perhaps ?
of course , i meant `` should i install dbus and get the output ''
my thing is , now that i know about ppa purge , how do i know what to tell the
do you have time for a quick transitional package type question ?
so what to do ?
what ?

since restart and stop/start it very different for apache2
gotcha .
oh , and i just realized gdal is a 2h build on armhf , so i guess i 'll revisit
i do n't think you have any ability to upgrade your kernel . you 're just a container , not
are you seeing a lot of messages about be leaving and rejoining ?
omg !
no , no not at all
what exactly ?
re : # 1486581 `` 4.2 rc7 '' ... as soon as anyone sees that , the default reaction is
can i do this with the system-image server ?
did you re-install the hwe support ?
did you read the comment ?
dunno , do we not ?
hi , sorry for my late response this time as i was in sauna .
yes , it 'll support both but we 'll be working on deprecating v3 and disallowing new v3 ones to
yes , as i change according ur tutorial but now i 'm doing it once again and let u see
so the wpm facade is an exception ?
such as the chipset you 're using , and what band you 're connecting to etc
what broke your sound ? how do you know it 's not working and not just muted or the volume
for webdm sergiusens is probably the best to answer your questions . he 'll also be back next week .
secureboot and fastboot is to turnoff windows stuff
so install a theme , 20 second test .
i 'd try the above , then
i can find them again if needed
# ubuntu-server ?
sure , use the next version number then
i wonder what it paused on , try cat /var/apt/term.log
let me fire up the vm
i see this : error : could not load host key : /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
so it seems : (
private-key-not-wiped-2.patch
sorry , not prefix but root
, yes but the card needs nvidia-prime if you wan na get it to work
when you get a moment , i just uploaded a new music app to the store which needs manual review
just go into the menu settings
is n't 14.04 the last lts ? maybe that 's just some non-sense i heard , but if it is
basically a browser like firefox running the slides based presentation .
i 'll review with abeato next week , but i know we 've dealt with other similar situations . maybe
i did sudo do-release-upgrade -d from wily
i just let irssi die quietly and restarted it this morning with the right creds
i am producing qcow2 images , so it 's only ~320mb .
o2
if you are really interested in being very kind to derivatives , we should 1 ) separate the startpage to
if it 's just on a local network rsync is a good option
on the phone ?
ok
you must be a troll since we both told you to install one thing and you 're still asking .
gim me a sec : )
nevermind then : ) best not to advice people if you 're not familiar .
looks like riddell is
where did you obtain this .dat file from . if kate does not open it ... its probably not a
ubuntu is installed in legacy mode , and windows is in efi mode
ah , true
+1
there was a landing for qtsystems-opensource-src yesterday but i could n't say whether or not it would cause that .
hey , for your donations request , it 'll help us if you can give a specific cost
ok sounds like you know what to try then . i 'm gone in about an hour so if you
irssi ( cli )
no , i meant 'deny ' rules . let me look at your paste
from anywhere ; if it is a gui app that is fine
the greeter logo does n't align , but i ponder if the greeter is at fault here , rather than
you not ?
i like that nick .
yeah but i figure it avoids an extra exec for uname
when does a kernel upgrade happen ? often ?
is it running server you wish to extend or it 's initial install you can redo however you wish ?
a clean fresh install is very reccomended
no , it finished - i was updating other software that required linux-headers and that 's when i noticed a
+1 spot on
yeah
seems not from the email i forwarded to you from a month and half , but he started working on
it just waits until life = dying , then calls ensuredead
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
um , are you talking about initrd ? : - )
you still about ?
so , as a service , sigsys , with log entry
yeah why not
because i like kdm both for the available themes , and the customization available from within kde
htop just watchs the traffic , the internet does n't usehtop
let me just complete my sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade routines
do n't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly ; if nobody knows your answer , nobody will answer you
do you have a special need for that service over ipv6 ? as they are slowly over time adding ipv6
yes
yeah , i seem to remember that too
yeah , will fix .
that was just to see where the lock was , if it is apt , then one might be able
moving to gcc 5 has this problems
i know , sorry for that . i am working on to clear it out a bit .
sorta like exercising you work up to the marathon .
maybe that 's because there is no such share ? as i recall every share has to have a path
shall i create one ?
is there any specific support issue ? for general talk please join the # ubuntu-offtopic channel
yeah , an independant vm with another disk
just remove my mp from 5 , reconfigure and rebuild
(
any error msg
no
logs me in as teamspeak3 , without pass requirement
it 's not normal for it to fail so early in the process .
you can of course test it if you have multiple networks available .
and with libllvm3.5 : i386
but as said , unless it is getting priority for ota , i can not do much
that is , day-to-day vivid upgrade ? or from trusty/utopic ?
i have a suspicion my purpose may be being overwritten
if the internet connection 's bad , then yes , it does matter
did you change anything prior to installing ubuntu the second time ?
i was wrong , after rebuilding with -- disable-mir-shared the backtrace looks different
thats nice
yes , after get one , what should i do ?
that 's correct
so i was n't part of the original discussion with regards to those patches ... i added my concerns to
can you add some more detail for testing on line 54 ?
sure .
i 'm still using it : )
which bug ?
what work ?
didrocks 's reverter was changing versions of 1.2-0ubuntu1 to 1.2.is.1.1-0ubuntu1
they are not american obviously .
pm me your email and i 'll connect you with libreoffice folks
do you use a usb wifi ?
or you can just startk muon-updater manually , it will do the check all the same
what do you think about the tower animation ?
we agree that usd 2.99 is too high for many app purchases . so , one thing we are suggesting
yeah , there used to be a thing one could tweak to disable it always syncing contacts to google ,
your physical ethernet port can have multiple ip addresses using software
ah this is interesting as when i first came into this chat my initial question was whether i should have
nite nite
on the laptop google.com says : `` the page is n't redirecting properly '' and localhost says : `` unable

it 's not the right way , no
also : option c from your quiz ...
you could also right click on the webpage and click `` view source ''

sure
well it is executed like , `` youtube-dl -xi myurl
it is either copied from some place or created from some other tool
are you installing air ?
the floatingflickable tests work : /
oh , yeah , i did n't think that you might look at the ubuntu page
oh , right
and what does `` ls -l /etc/alternatives/java '' report ?
interpolate you mean mix them ?
i 'll follow the instructions from there .
yes , 14.04 lts
do you want that to pop into wily ?
the package is needrestart
nice , i like that kind of algorithms : ) good food and updates for my phone ; )
i already fixed several such issues on the unity flavours , i just have to do the inverse for everyone
if that is the issue , check out swappiness .
enjoy ! holler when it breaks : )
no . reinstall
that 's all rebuilt now right and is it only built for vivid now right ?
well , yeah . but we did n't have assert_partitions until just yesterday . its not in trusty
its a luks on lvm setup , but i get the `` hdd unlocked successfully '' message and then it
just flashed latest vivid , and i see the default as 10 mins
oops , 750gb , you 're right .
you would have to build it all , then make panel would work to rebuild just the panel bits if
hold shift at boot and there will be extra options to boot with .
sure , just enable persistent journal , see /usr/share/doc/systemd/readme.debian
voidspace , which means we should n't try to remove any machine that still has allocated addresses to cleanup ,
yes , i already updated the mp
that may work
did you browse the filesystem to associate java to jar files ?
do u have `` indicator-session '' installed ?
yep , guess so . doesnt hurt to check tho
what is the responsibilities of the network-manager service ?
if it were still before christmas we could get you a flash drive to install from
jibel i suspect this affects all flavours .
18utc as well ?
sell no
it could be one tab with all of that data , yeah
no , the it wouldnt be using nouveu

there seems to have been an issue before while removing it , and now it complains because it wants to

err
i thought hallyn made them tolerate each other , but best to check with him on the specifics .
sweetness . will it come back though ...
yes it is specific , based on the state of the node and the node
again , keep in mind that 15.04 is on the verge of being unsupported . i highly recommend updating to
i know you know ! but what i 'm saying , it 's probably some transient issue ; )
/var/log/sddm.log ?
oh yeah , i had asked charles about that , but forgot to follow-up on it
indeed it does
np - let me know if it all works out
will importing to git actually fix the problems that plague the importer ?
you had me worried
so it did work , as in it booted but got stuck later .
ca n't that considered to be done ?
possibly
i was talking about it with didrocks earlier - he 's going to look tomorrow

your nick looks very liberal and progressive

yeah , first i will try usr/sbin/pma-configure

well , try to import 51,000 images ... and then tell me how long did you wait ; )
find out the filesystem , not hard dude
dpi calculation and setting have been screwed up by keith packard very comprehensively
you switched the driver but still get the grey screen ?
i3-wm ( source : i3-wm ) : improved dynamic tiling window manager . in component universe , is optional .
if i do not override abstractbutton.trigger ( ) , then the action will be triggered immediately
i got it on highlight , just to track its state . so far it seems unpopular - which is

i prefer xchat ; tcl is fun : )
if your intent was the former , please upload , and we 'll clean it up .

okay , cool
the md5sum

ideas ?
basically it 's just :

that would be the best security practice
nope - failed that

after my last crash , it did n't crash 2h30 here now
it 's safe ... and fixes a cve : )
ehm , the other one too : p
dimitern : this means we can have nice declarative conditional-free definitions of various sets of workers and their dependencies
all i can suggest is to look at the lxc ubuntu-cloud template which is a bash script to see what
of course , we started from the free-for-all openstack model and aws restrictions constrained the model in a few ways
that might be more for # ubuntu-offtopic : p
no error
glad to hear
okay , nothing to see here , just retry the build .
yes but it supports certain things for free out of the box : like using setuptools without asking
i mean , you know , the parameters before `` text ''
that script will probably call the linker
sudo apt-get purge
for people like me
so i have to find a context for them
ok figured something like that
yeah run my above command if `` pastebinit '' is installed
or loadup previous kernel , many things you can test
i do n't even know that is possible
no , was more kidding ( started at 7 )
yesterday 's was usable ; syslinux built with gcc5 is broken , we 're working on getting a new image
lem me try
i can do that myself real quick
no such thing as manually upgrading 32 > 64 bit .
we added an ebook type at rschroll 's request , so i 'd assumed he 's already planning content-hub integration
and whats throwing that error message ?
i see
hey now , everything has been ubuntu related but i will try and keep myself in check : )
ok
might be people around , otherwise fire a mail at the ubuntu phone list
konversation keeps disconnecting me
but i see what you mean
did you check the hash of the iso ?
sorry , i 'm very confused
( by you returning a state with whatever changes )
it 's not really where that config is suppose to go , it 's suppose to go with the site
you said you wanted this in the chroot ... is that package installed in the chroot ?
i 'm in moonstone . eric and wayne are taking a break
jibel : ok , i will look into it some more
uninstall my running kernel ?
i do n't get it : package 'cairo-dock ' is not installed , so not removed.. it removed the side
we do not have the resources to be picky .
you might have run into # 1467640 ?
curl.curl is my favorite snappy package now btw . an iot device with no cli network tool feels dead
so just ask them .
^^
should i merge it ?
there 's a # launchpad that mght be more useful
why is that your goal ?
also note that perlapi is part of perl-base so you *can't* downgrade without massive system breakage .
that 's what i did ( i found a screenshot ona askubuntu ... but the sd button does not show

^
( also , will we realistically ever take the curtin language in to 0.7.x ? )
i would first take the drive out , and backup what you need
and that works as far as i 've been able to test it
say i am putting 5 million lines into a dataframe , imagine doing that repeatedly in an ipython notebook
yes
12.04 is lts . it still gets security patches
you can only use one installer at a time ,
no , not without a question : )
you normally do n't want that crud filling up your console anyway ( well , at least *i* do n't
sure , but that file is big and scary !
does that mean `` i 've tested it and it is ready '' ?
then you feel it is more capable ?
the second stuff i would to check to test with you is the usage of metacity theme comming with matecity
lol
workaround in the comments .
the list i pastebined you yesterday was that
it is an hp f018-dx
you should n't be able to get more errors in theory
oh , you ask all the hard questions
nah , do n't care , if it 's working for everyone , i 'll just ignore it .
seems like regressions in kdepim being installable on arm and ppc64 are the blockers , i 've no idea how
the program doesnt pick the source port , but it gets a usable surce port assigned from the networking stack

i do n't have my membership yet
toshiba can hold some bios firmware updates perhaps , doublecheck their website please
still does n't work
i 'm writing up a bug right now for broken local provider ... .
not ubuntu 's responsibility , sorry . plenty of more useful channels on freenode , like a cyanogenmod one perhaps
and how did you install your video driver ? from ubuntu or from some website ?
oh well , the n7 would n't be such a good phone ... it 's too big . : d
if it 's in a script you can , you ca n't just `` sudo cd '' , though
you dont use startx on ubuntu .
i am trying to enable wifi through rfkill , the issue i am seeing is that if its turned off
and do n't forget flying cockroaches : p
how can the slow speed be improved
right.. maybe one for each then : )
comment # 6 in that bug report also confirms my earlier suspicion this is caused by udev
when you said , the `` login screen '' , is that the kubuntu login screen ? or the terminal
well , every u-boot has variables , just make it read one
no
the fact that this is only on a very unusual error path and that none of our actual juju code
that would be more work than starting a live session , install broadcom driver and starting the installation
the url is currently on a server i have no control over and can't/wo n't be updated . it will
port 22 might be blocked by the firewall .
okay cheers !
you keep forgetting the second parameter man
i do n't have ~/.cache , cause it 's a headless buildd without a systemd logind session ... .
obviously 156mb is useless for ubuntu , so use the installer or gparted to delete that one and manually create
not really
just make sure we do n't drop fixes that are already there . does the current version in -proposed cause
and `` ls /lib/modules/ /writable/cache/system/ ''
hmm dunno , i click on them and they disappear
then make sure you have something to boot ( like a iso or a disk ) on that guest
especially that if you use it in a listview.header , then you do n't have to care about that
fair enough , i 'm just saying that i bet some money that it 's not fixed for the lts
wallyworld : i have experienced differences in aws over different regions before
well i didn ; t have any error so i assume they were installed when progress bar reach 100 %
those were the previous hostnames
ok , cool .
yup as i mentioned in the mp steps i asked you to test with
so , a workaround for now is to set the snappy_launcher_skip_apparmor env variable : )
maybe its because of .xauthority file ?
nice , also vivid ?
will d
thx
skweek : ahh , sorry about that then : )
ctrl+space
some manufacturers/providers block tethering on android . with cyanogenmod it works
its an option to use it for security
how did you install dropbox , it has it 's own way ?
you 'll notice a double dose of them in arm64 , ppc , and ( to a lesser extent )
you mean , after it actually gets out of -proposed , right ?
nice work ! ok , i will get another video out this afternoon , and then i will upgrade and
where is that machine hosted ?
ah , yeah , that might just do it . lol
yes , i can re-trigger

can you boot a live version of ubuntu ? from a cd or usb stick on the problem computer ?
aside from changing os , my hostname changed from ownamini to owna-mini
that is np , we use configs for that , just put the right branch and maybe let me know

but like ogra_ said , there will be some changes : )
oh
ok ... can i get somewhere a list of the default installation packages ?
nope , i rebooted still the same .
in the past there was /showdown/apps
i would be very surprised if that 's the case .
it 's not using flash for netflix i do n't think . but the flash in chrome is licensed to

well for instance we have a synology storage server on the network , and from osx it can be reached
things going ok/making sense/going to work out ?

the website team ?
yes and know lost count of times it dies ... .. maybe i should next time
chaning 0.1 to 1.2 in soundpage does not help ...
does mir-on-x work with proprietary nvidia ?
ahh , found it .
gotcha so maybe updating the init scripts to do something like ceilometer-polling -- namespace
so that was the issue ... glad you got it solved : )

nothing . should work normally
eww
do n't ask me : )
good supported afaik
is there any other browser ?
what are you making a package of ?
and one failing qmltest . i 've commented on the branch
i did n't set them up , sorry
will tell you on monday then : )
it would be nice if i could keep my home folder . is this possible when reinstalling ubuntu ?
good point !
download iso from ubuntu.com , ran startup disc creator from my 14.04 laptop
depends on how much fun you 're having doing a massive nonrepeating knitting pattern of 200 stiches
so the work will start on the cloud end and the sharing part will be later on top of that
windows , from where i try to connect to the sftp
has this interaction lugs from us taken off yet ?
pastebin the requested information please .
ppp-dns.service
yeah !
your welcome i like to stay topical ; )
essentially stepping over
can i announce this on kubuntu.org or is more testing needed ?
i tested ctrl alt f2 too
i 'm sorry , i still do n't get it : ( i have a click , it 's a
yep
yeah , aiui that unfortunately doesnt help here
is there anything in that dir ?
i 'm currently running ubuntu mate
i had passed the incognito param on the binary file directly . it was n't a binary file btw .
that 's okay . how do i do it ?
the 4200g is too deep for the cabinet we have . well it fits if i do n't plug any
sorry i find your reinstall suggestion to be somewhat hilarious
# ubuntu+1 please
you can revert that to ( > = 1.4 ) for ubuntu
if there are channel logs search for my nick a few days ago i went throught the same exact thing
try the # debian channel please
i have n't heard any users complain
i 'll try and find the bug report and see if it has repro instructions
nope i have everything enabled
no its a huion tablet
i am going to start preparing my requests for packaing . i 'll subscribe ubuntu-sponsors .
zyxel router blocks maybe ?
i guess my question is more with regards to if this is normal ?
but to expose the nodes behind it a bit more networking needs to happen
it 's people sending a trigger to ubottu . ubottu is a bot we use him to send information to
me neither on 14.04 + updates +3rd party enabled
yes , but that 's been the case since the austin sprint at least
in home in root or what
yes , but i had to make changes to it in response to what he asked for , so really
no the cable is satisfactory . gigabit in windows on same machine .
^
those were the first things i tried
right . the click store knows `` application '' , not `` app ''
games games games
have n't tried command line .
init 3/5/6
yes , i can log in , and every time it flickers back i see that mouse position , windows
you ca n't turn off hotspot at all ?
which ubuntu version are you using ?
remember to sync it to wily afterwards though
thx . momo
generating the passing .result file is done from d-jenkins
that is using u-d-f , or after it ?
i wonder if it is the qt versions you are building playing havoc with the system maybe ?
good luck
ok , you 're added now : )
so you need lots of short messages rather than few long ones ?
so where are you typing in that command ?
i 'm using a dvd called ubuntu monster pack
i mean , fair enough i guess if people actually use aws_secret_access_key for their openstack password , we do n't
by upgrading you loose the 5 years support om 14.04 , 14.10is way shorter is all .
it 's more an effect of visibility
actually just recording with another camera might give clues ...
in your case , it would never be
but i ca n't pause the current track
join me at boots on the guernsey high-street , down staring at the vitamin section
right
essentially it now works with dependencies for free
also check the application list at winehq
or just drop `` function '' : )
they 'll help you in # vbox - this has nothing to do with ubuntu , sorry .
in any case , you should get build permissions if you 've been landing already
ok , so `` snappy list '' shows that snap , then
in the ppa you mean ?
you can use find or the file extension , and run it through the file command to check the res
how would we do such an audit ? is it possible to grep all clicks ?
thats not a list of what comes with lubuntu , no
pastebin the entire output .
the problem is that you do n't have to specify them all and some may show up later
ah , yes
so what do the log say ?
pls submit the proposal against staging
it 's a pretty common problem we see ; sometimes due to bad advice in forums , sometimes due to
depens on the site . a lot of warez sites fake that error to make you install a virus .
yes i did , let me then remount in proper way
ack , perfect
nope
pft , that is pathetic . should n't be the case now .
at least from my experience i can use mount with runcmd which requires root
just to stdout/err
re : developer , i used to maintain some debian packages ( which end up in ubuntu ) , but
well , having one of the mir debs to conflicts or such on the old u-s-c so updating mir force
are you really a person ?
as i said the apparmor message you posted is a result of running from qtc . our helper scripts need
yeah , you ca n't easily do that with the spreadsheet
wow , that worked . you are a genius
ask in # # linux for xampp help then , its not supported here
no , where did you take that from ? i saw you mention it , but it was not what
yes
you 're using a web page to view this irc channel ? i 'm interested to know where that page
seems like someone messed with permissions ?
for apt . please add them in apt.conf
what statement is provably false ?
by running `` lshw -c video '' or `` lspci -k | grep -a 3 vga '' , for example
there are other tools but that 's the one i thought about
great question ... i assume the store people can ...
i know , that 's really really weird
actually sudo apt-get install pastebinit -y & & df -h | pastebinit
ok . i guess i should change to wily then .
if we fix drags in emulator and can put it back in phone mode , presumably the tutorial will also
whats your end goal to do ?
i ca n't just do that
we are doing a new release on monday ?
do n't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly ; if nobody knows your answer , nobody will answer you
looks like it sees it now
system requirements i know but my question pertained more to support for old hardware ...
hi
linked , or include ?
you are wrong .
i am on wily
there was discussion about frameworks yesterday . i accept the current model would n't work well , but if the
and oddly those seem to be available everywhere
i was waiting to hear from mvo_ about si 3.1 and plans to unfork it there , but have n't
vbox version ?
the biggest problem for the live usb is that the default user has no password ( and has sudo access
that 's definitely the right error . there ought to be a few lines above that that give info about
that 's a change to how it used to be in the past ? we did n't use to hit
not in python3 anymore
i 'd argue that the errors you get *are* part of the api
so it 's asking you for a password for the keyring to lock it
it 's not 100 % clean , particularly the entanglement of operation state with operation definition
yeah , so i guess do n't develope for oracle java ... or make an install script .
if i use 'ssh -v user @ host.name.me -p 7777 '' it does n't give an error , it just
do tell !
what packages had to be changed to get those working ?
do you think # debian will be helpful
03:00.0 network controller : intel corporation centrino advanced-n 6200 ( rev 35 )
i can fix it myself : )
tv is not the issue .
i am asking for mechanism , not policy
try locate sources.list.d
i ca n't find ~/.config/vlc/vlcrc
`` sudo apt-get install pastebinit & & sudo iptables -l|pastebinit ''
that 's fine , but this is strictly a support channel .
right
for me that says bus 004 device 003 : id 0a5c:2145 broadcom corp. bcm2045b ( bdc-2.1 ) [ bluetooth controller
sweet !
its more obvious in the new cloud-init code ... walinuxagent buries it
do you have changed the settings in vlc ?
i hope you understand how unhelpful that comment is
query , are there any good green cards to pick up that wo n't impede you at all ?
like how you determined things were uninstalled ( versus just broken ) and what they were
ncdu isnt ndcu .
i.e . we only use the screenshot if the app 's oom'ed , or starting
at least their are not conflicting : )
if you meant sru_report rather than update_excuses , yeah . that could use a tweak to show ignored tests .
sure he does , i 'm his mgr now
lspci should give you a shorter output
that is a file transfer
hey , i wanted to hack on this , you 're depriving me of the opportunity ; )
read the man page , it expects the edid information on stdin ; )
any reason one should not enable it ?
tell me when you 've posted and i 'll hit the update button on the download page
cool , will do
stop . explain clearly all on one line if you want any help here
it actually works quite well , with the last akonadi stuff .
my team has been working on a rewrite for the thumbnailer , but since it was deferred from landing in
i have a user . how do i find out which all groups he belongs to
it could be so , check glxgears for me ?
the channel redirects here , it 's not closed
you must set an ssh key or password inside the image first .
what client are you using ?
so we have `` oem install is broken '' and `` can not eject cd '' anything else ?
may i see your build/core/main.mk ? put it on pastebin or so .
will this work logged in as the working user gui ?
hmmmm ok , that should have been part of the bug report : d
found the ban , wo n't keep you a minute
ok ... i 'll do that , except i 'll have to d/l a new iso image
no
like i just said twice , you ca n't use any driver with currently supported ubuntu versions : )
this is scopes shell
either way , i 'd love to play with it in austin when we both get there .
with local sysroot and toolchains yes .. that is not a challange for qtcreator either
silos not building branches for wily ?
it has to really , or it could end up in a conflict ,
np : )
no mopre missing address ?
hopefully yep , although there seems to be another bug right behind it if this one clears
the alarm id is stored in cookie , but that si not exposed to qml
well , there *is* something passed to the thing via the ldflags , it 's setting the version string to
that is tricky , can you get a photo of the errors perhaps when they start ?
well , depends on who wants credit for the upload and who 's forwarding the fix to debian . ;
yea
oom-killer once hard-froze a hardy system when it started killing things , so ehh
yes , and tested to be solid
was that with the graphical splash ?
what do i use to burn the iso to usb ?
where can i report the calibre suit being removed by the ppa ?
oh i see what you 're saying , cool
yes , thats a bug , preventing watchdog from doing what it is supposed to do
people are going to be grumpy
please pastebin the output of `` mount '' .
any idea what differences there are between `` su eric '' and `` su - eric '' ?
type sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
that 's a horrible book : (
the question is if it 's the same issue or not
the only error i see in xorg log is this :
that is true.. then i dont have to redownload the entire think and just recheck the download..
your wiki link will suffice . i 'm cracking down on these `` of course i 've got a wiki
so i now have a dying channel that my goroutine is selecting on
ah , so libakonadiprotocolinternals1 will come back ?
see the mouseover ; )
a good widget developer thinks about all of them , but that 's sometimes asking too much xd
* means any/every .
yes
main repos had issues few days ago but should by solved by now
for that , you could also ask in # ubuntu , btw .
sure.. i understand that . its still broken
i do n't agree with everything you put , but they were thoughtful comments
so you have to choose which os to boot when talking about `` dualboot '' . all other boot methods
oh , fantastic
i have another thought on how that could work , but it wo n't work for si 2.5 , only
this ( -z ) just compresses during transfer , thouzgh , i do n't think that 's what mojtaba is
also train is really sensitive to the packaging being just so , easy when we 're upstream , harder for
no , that 's not correct as that 's trying to move it to beneath configold
ctrl-s to save the /etc/default/grub file , then go to the terminal and do a - > sudo update-grub
i am in the us , server is in germany
that 's my take . i 'd love ericsnow and wwitzel3 's
that is great
oh , sorry , no -- the line you changed short-circuits that
how did you set your dns to 8.8.8.8 ?
to 775 ?
you got to love kde , its freakin awesome
so what did you install apache on ?
note there is n't a .qml file yet : p just the click stuff .desktop etc
please , next time add that info to the silo , otherwise i test with rc-proposed
trust your work !
pong
cheers : )
yep , you should have done that actually
oh actually also this enforcement is only for dual silos , so if you are just working on some desktop
then from within the compiled folder they are called
usb is slow !
that 's odd , it should clear the dirty flag at the beginning of the build
do you see what i mean about having details nested inside what one whight thing were model packages ?
smile and nod , it 's safer
i. e. the user data you need is the `` manager '' , and there is no - > my_manager
that is not standard behaviour on the mac .
so , should i add more races , or take some away ?
and fwiw , you should never enable the root account on ubuntu
as a subordinate and such
so if your card is n't responding to the aps , so that they can hear you , you ca
tested on wily , though it looks like it could work all the way back to oldest supported lts
i read that unity was known for not being so customizable as others ...
like /home on a dedicated partition ?
it seems you 've customised the alsa configuration drivers , so the default device is the loopback device . that
you should have heard/read that lxde is doing that.. upstream
wwitzel3 : excellent . we 'll have a few docker examples that we 're going to re-tool to using the
mips not arm
what is the purpose of the connection at all ?
i ca n't run google earth anymore either
because the -dev package is n't multiarched
not at all
probably , i dunno
got a link to it ? i can try playing it
can you pastebin it all
ah , ok , and the reason why we did n't get the security update 2 weeks ago is because
maybe have a look at ~/.config/gtk* stuff
you have been told twice already .
i am looking for advice from ubuntu user who is doing ruby on rails .
but it break if you have two snappy-like partitions around
rsync is n't instant .
the new theme and icon also looks cool .
so let 's assume our oobe requests the user to specify a unique image ( probably taken with the camera
o heve acer aspire m1641 and get this error unable to find medium containing live file system
these *all* work with screen
is the bike-shedding not already resolved from on-high ? ; )
well , it could be an issue with the factory devices , it could be a faulty mmc on your
it 's 10pm , we 're running windows in a linux channel and we 're wearing sunglasses at night .
you mean newer version of ubuntu could have tmux 1.9 ?
( hence my link to checkinstall earlier
yes , i imagined as the error you showed me comes from that test .
dell inspiron 3443
sorry , but if you give bad advice then you will be called out .
actually no . no-mounting used to happen with the os that was previously installed on it
dm - > as in debian maintainer ? ! this is ubuntu developer membership board and can not advice about
i have one rtsp stream which i am playing on ubuntu 12.04 and i am getting it perfectly fine .
i thought you had a magic `` disable '' button ; we used to in the past
that does n't work , you 're missing my point . the loop driver hard-codes 512 byte sectors . my
is tha qsynth ?
quickest way might be to use a virtual machine or chroot or lxc and install a very old version of
mmm , destruction of history was one of the things that i was unsure of
ok
especially not when you 're messing with disks at a low level . anything that involves repartitioning or formatting or
not yet . cyphermox will builds `` happen '' now ? popey wants to see some carnage .
try it
i play cs : source , do n't starve , civ v , l4d2 and borderlands 2 on my linux
type /join # ubuntu-br
oh , that is true today
i have only been playing with the amd64 build on the desktop ( because there 's no armhf 5.0 build
sounds to be worth a try ... maybe we 'll catch more non-determinstic issues
i just remembered i misplaced my usb
so long as theme is installed in /usr/share/ you can just use the standard keys , no extenstion required
type xmodmap -pke | curl -f `` sprunge= < - '' sprunge.us
looks like you 've broken the update-alternatives links
qtbase failed to build on ppc64el
it is the world 's greatest corner case .
yeah i noticed !
but you know if you are paying any other way other than a check , than you are looking at
i 've changed app_id in makefile
that is true . i am pinging 10.43.201.12
yes , so f8 is the boot menu key .
so , again , back to your question , yes , i use my phone in a productive environment
also consider zapping the pram to help this situation , the key combo is on the apple website .
real instruments ?
so that 's prevented
no
the same does n't happen on vmware fusion , so perhaps this is related to the nvidia driver..
same , install it from muon software center : )
3 , 4 , 6 and 7 are ready for qa
gmail is n't an app ...
i guess so - the industrial and charm test jobs most likely
do you know if that 's likely to happen soonish ?
right . without that i would still have the problem .
are you sure that the tar output was on the same drive that you looked at with df -h ?
ok crashes on i7 , yay !
ok , which gpu is it ?
she 's at home 300 metres away . we have no internet at the new house ( moved last week
wily 's old news already
with pat it 's 3 people who have major problems with this update , it is not even translated .
one step at a time : )
or they need one , just behaving as-if they were not exempt
yes , i know this only applies to apps that have extra content inside the app
i thought so ... but last time i tried that i got an exception and was told to do this
if recoverymode cant recover might do the clean install afterall
so i 'm trying to test this in 1.23
oh , sorry , i wanted to say that you could put it under ~snappy-dev : - )
it may be that those two types are unnecessary
with sudo ?
so it sounds like you have a plan to fix the issue via the calendar devs adding a qml property
i believe so
stop !
if someone can demonstrate they can do rather than just use lots of tlas
i would like to change it , that in case of a not found it 's fine and in case
so what if it 's already been released with a 15.10 . * version number ?
so all in all - checking the changelist on the ppa package detail page is the best option ?
if qa doesnt have anything .-.. and if we are happy with the missing rollback , yes
feel free to cc : me though , so i can be in the loop
nah that 's alright , was just to find out whether it 's online right now
thats bad
yes
maybe assert bluez5 as a hard requirement for us ?
later , a day before the final release i guess
i do n't have one off the top of my head , but it might be useful to look at
the tricky part is we ahve to have some kind of network dependency - preferably network-online.target possibly , but not
lets assume that the jenkins thing works
sort of , all normal packages get to specify which security policies they need
did you enable remote desktop ? its off by default
i believe that they just work either way .
backbox is not supported here
i use everything . i went from windows to linux in 1995 . then back to windows in 2004/5 ,
cause something is off
that is with the gocheck fix as far as i can tell
\o/
as you wish
approved ! nice work . the task popped up with `` waiting for parental consent approval '' so you may
you as well
got it - i added your repo as a remote and merged the branches
it 's working now : )
your asking how the software changed then
if you 've having issues , look at the packages it wants to grab , download them manually and install
at least not in help output
i assume ubuntu cloud are participating ?
so send only snap or code too ?
check with pitti maybe he is ( was ? ) co-upstream for that
or retrieve the exit command of the remote command ?
we can be smart once we have the store list the files with hashes and tags them with arch (
: d
the map app did , not the agps stuff
mo'in ! what 's the plan with trunk vs 15.04 ?
+1 from me from your pastebin
because sudo will give root permissions indeed
all the 3.13 and 3.16 kernels wo n't boot . ext2 module is missing fro mthe initramfs
/system-a/boot has 3.19.0-22 files
the time differences will take a bit to settle ; ntp slews the clock based on historical sampling , and
yes
so with that command ran on usr and etc i should be all good ?
k ; pre uefi system . let 's boot ubuntu , boot the box and as soon as the bios
just do n't forget to click on `` i 'll be careful , i promise '' button , and mean
that 's odd ...
i suggest rebooting if you have n't already
tearing while playback videos on parole
my one mac has it
if anything it 'd probably be in ~/.config/google-chrome
that 's the grace time the app gets for storing its state
i do n't blame anyone , i file bugs !
i 've asked for information on the bug to find out what the right answer is for finding the password..
yes , give me a sec
and what is confusing for you in that article ?
are you in the 'less ' pager ?
rtfd
then i will try all the night ; d
but it will probably be much different or at least configured differently than the custom repo you 're attempting to
handful of desktops , which one ?
nope
the unity stuff for tv is n't done yet , it 's not started yet either . it will be
you prefer old good kernels , which had the time to mature a little bit , like old wine ,
ok , so now let 's try unlocking the encrypted files to a temporary mount point : `` ecryptfs-recover-private /home/.ecryptfs/simon/.private/
pssh is parallel ssh , it runs commands on multiple hosts simultaneously , or something similar anyway : )
there we go - webmin
so , that suggests the one in the initrd is bad/corrupt
i thought it meant that the transaction had failed too many times
ok ... i 've forced master-next with the updated udeb names , getting the depend : right has cleared out
thats what you get if you add a ppa which has no builds for your release
if you are publishing web content from multiple editors , there are likely many other better ways to do it
its a google plus live session where you can ask the engineers of ubuntu any question ,
you rock^2
i will make a quick install now on a ssd to test , how would u advice to update grub
really o_o okay
ok i 'll dig in a little after some lunch
no point in having three disks in a notebook if they are being slowed down ; )
and despite being unmanaged ( by maas ) i can still use them for instance selection and then configure them
turns out you cant merge +junk branches
how would a filterbynamesstrategy be created ?
the old testament has a whole new meaning when you read bugles as bulges
sorry , i 'm being dense , i ca n't follow the chain that causes a different state to be
will come automatically over the time
you can create a functioning ubuntu environment using debootstrap . it is n't easy , nor is it a supported
hm . so which one is better to do in you opinion ?
^^
ok , executing : - )
i 'm using the version that was installed by the additional drivers gui .
that file 's hash checks out here
hangon
i deleted it without using sudo and the loop continues
two things going on there
you tried today 's desktop image ? installation fails for me because extra.ubunut.com does n't exists
we all here to learn , no sweat
it used to be fetched from a charm called midonet-repository that you told me to remove and make the repo
ok try to restart
no luck in a java channel ?
a reinstall with a proper actual supported ubuntu
kk - tx
what is the output of cat /etc/issue
there 's no whitelist per se , currently the train assumes `` mp = canonical owns this '' , which
onces i 'm done with the book i will look at the link you game me
yes
then `` no '' you ca n't do it
np .
you 're akiva on launchpad , are n't you ?
well not if you then go and selsect cc_variant=-5 : )
wrt wrong chat , no : guest42341 comes in every day , shouts something , and goes away
hello-world.env prints them out
ok great
that changelog is a bug
no meeting for tonight ?
fixed
should i install some package ?
ok , i 'll review
another issue with dh-python
it can only be that it 's slightly less code to use , i guess
you can list spaces to see that though
my other ( lenovo x201 ) has that boot menu if i hit f12 . it 's a very nice
i 'm thinking . kind of outta ideas
again , you 're still worrying about y .
do this - # ls -al /proc/3974/fd
you can only adb shell in once the phone is unlocked
if you create a 'place ' in an open file dialog and uncheck the box to only show in that
: )
/me is straining to remember , will have to look into -- slightly different invocation at least
it 's there .
but there is an upstream bug that can be problematic for now , so i post-poned it for now .
i formated the usb with a linux tool to create the fat32 partition .
mysql uses bzr . ubuntu uses bzr , there are a number of other big projects that use bzr .
it should probably create a .crassh yeah
i filed bug 1420336
what about the package version ?
^ so try that one ?
so whats the output of `` ./thatfile '' then ?
i do n't think i have efi
josh should know , but he 's not on irc atm .
if you have questions , just leave them and i 'll answer when i get back if no one else
if you want : )
have still happening that .
usb kb+mouse i take it ?
cool
everything i commented on the original branch should be fixed now
pretty sure ? unless it was newly seeded for some reason
i 'd also be trying a known-good ethernet cable on the basis the current one might be damaged
just ask , wait and see
oh it will totally cause problems , because it will fragment how we run tests even more
how about trying ubuntu server and do the pentesting over there ?
so each reboot gives you identical environment
humm ... . i look playonlinux by ubuntu
if ubuntu are n't going to use it for 16.04 will it get any sort of support ?
package avclam does not exist in vivid
oh , hm . nothing jumped out at me there
we kept getting races with it being a script in upstart , which is why we want it to be
i just load that file with `` qml ''
yeah , going to teach me to use rmadison next time
or should we rely on the client checking the error field of each space
ah
now we 're talking !
after meeting , - > unstable then syncpackage
those instructions are for bios rather than uefi , and depend on plomos being able to boot from usb ,
yes , 14.04 and 14.10
yeah , just going through that , but there 's no list of `` interesting '' plugins there unfortunately
in this case i 'd just point folks to the pr
highlight ubuntu-desktop , press `` - '' , then highlight ubuntu-server , press +
what would you consider cheap and which province you in ?
that would be the idea yes , but most of the work is identifying the right place to attach a
that 's only for supported devices , and the nexus 5 is n't supported .
the directory created as a result of `` bzr branch lp : foo '' is the branch
no , have n't figured the colors yet
nope .
but the canadian folks literally had no way to send me a us one .
ubuntu desktop ( should have specified ) comes default with dnsmasq
gnome-disks just crashed on me
only question i had was : is the commandlineparser changes supposed to show up in there ?
and if it is , why do n't i see it ? : p
unable to locate package aconv
responded
that 's the script we generate - which is the same for multiple nics
grub should only be updated if initrd.img or kernel changes .
i 'm not even sure how lp behaves with a source that it ca n't create build records for .
grumble . sorry .
ok , press ctrl+c
you wo n't get the new kernel unless you go to some effort to install it
ok , thx !
btw , one thing : there is a new background image , and laney mentioned today on # ubuntu-desktop that
what am i supposed to do when i bring it back on normally ?
i mean if i had ubuntu my only operating system on my laptop , is there a virtual box application
right - the default is 5 seconds . and when i try to override it - its still 5 seconds
my main key is offline , so i 'll need another location based reminder to do it .
with apps opened or without ?
command not found
you can learn alot about the things that go wrong , and how to fix then , in channels like
no , that was for lickalott
well , in later versions of ubuntu they merged it back into simply `` safely remove '' , but anyway
apache runs under root ...
yep
what is your question or problem ?
but not if the test relies on gtk element ids
and what environment/provider are you using ( juju switch )
there are also ways to install other distro persistent on an usb , maybe something more for you ?
trying to watch build silo 21 , now that cjwatson kindly restarted the armhf build which had failed ( see
state would notice that the connection died though , right ? that could be an even to unlock .
you started with taking a movie in your bathroom ! !
omit the initrd parameter .
well , i 'm taking screenshots . i would expect to see them somewhere
i ran 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-wallpapers ' and the problem solved .
this is the only hard drive i have hahaha hahah ... .
hey
oh sure , let me try
how generous !
before catering for that case i wanted to know it that 's in any way a reality as the parsing
perfect !
well you ca n't share between different distros , out by linking to the same project
sorry for the trouble
nice
um ?
tedg ^
in the snap package
ah.. i have posted everything.. what do u mean.. the only thing , i masked was the proxy url..
ooooh yeah
maybe your path does n't include git
so , you got it in /etc/rc*.d , it runs manually , does n't run on boot and it 's
and it 's greyed out , ca n't toggle
looks like this was reported with 1.23 , is it still chewing 100 % cpu on 1.24.3 ?
nvidia still has binary blobs in the drivers , from what i understand .
that 's why i suggest a l-s hack .
ah okay
update-manager
you realise you have to substitute 'username ' with your username ?
the newer one , i forget the designation
gotcha
: @
bad call.. i have already tried this one ... and ok ... it worked
ok .
fortunately one of the affected auto-sync runs did ~nothing - i 'm assuming dinstall must have had a slight hiatus
switching between terminals : ( extra keystrokes .
if its red . white is middle , green is low . mm is muted . use the arrowkeys
it 's possible . you can check by examining debian/changelog file in the respective mp targets , if the first
i will give the bug id now
i need the complete url : )
also , we ca n't decide for you . what works for us might not work for you
/join # ubuntu
does /var/www/shrinktheapp/bin/celery daemonize automatically ?
i can certainly do the `` dump some stuff in a ppa '' bit , sure .
i 'm just saying split things out to be a little more fine-grained
yeap typical developers
needs x-ubuntu-use-langpack : yes removed and then it wo n't get stripped ?
sooo ...
yes except merge & clean is automatic and you do n't have permission to publish . i 'm afk but
it 's a guest user account , so not your user ... good way to test if it 's your
suppose you have 3 sessions in xsessions/
if you are trying to write an im application , the best thing to do would probably be to work
oh yeah ! , that 's a good one for noadays games
the # # programming channel is more apprpriate for that ; this is for ubuntu support
no solution that involves ls and sed is correct , ever
my fix needs work on other fronts
a bot
i *am* living on the moon in a steel cage , are you not ?
can you elaborate on the required 32-bit packages ?
yeah ofc
we did n't get errors , but no bars ?
sure , ask in # # windows
might be handy if you state the make and model : )
whoa that is , whoa
i 'm surprised i 'm not , as matz ( ruby creator ) is a huge emacs fan : )
that 's good news indeed
there are some reasons to have a seperate /boot , but most do n't apply to a home user .
i have managed to get that to work but it was a little hairy
that is nuts
all worked except ubuntu minimal
what filsystem does that disks have ?
yay , congrats to 14.04.2 , just saw the announcement
is that in the top level folder ?
maybe you shouldstart with what package you want
no , everything default here
not many . elopio is finishing the sprint in austin
idk whats wrong then that should of dimmed the brightness
ok , so this is different : ) you 're specifying the ip in the add-machine command - ssh :
i have seen a similar question regards that.. hmm
you know ansible ? ! ? ! cool , imma ask u stuffs
sorry for the blurry pictures only i was holding a mouse still while taking them : ) poor excuse i
there 's some fallback code in systemctl that seems like it wants to try to do the right thing ,
and how many packages need the b-d change ?
14.04
installed it but it did n't fix the problem .
it 's the gateway usually
no it is a separate software
please keep in mind that old configuration files might - but also might not - cause probems with plasma5
yeah man , you on live ?
you just have to compile yourself for windows
try if a `` sudo update-grub '' will do
on the a/c ? or everywhere ?
you 're running vivid , right ?
ya sure !
dobey wants to make s-c compatible with ci landing , he just did n't get to do yet
faenil maybe , but that 's wget 's reason to live . downloading is not si-cli 's reason to live
um . there 's also the snapcraft ppa
you can chown it , apache only needs read
ahm ... nope : )
so you 're on kdm now ?
brb
well honestly.. most likely the only place were the true info you need is physicly written down would be on
you just said you are using system monitor .
no . its dead since july
k. considering that we are close to 1.23 , i 'd rather file a bug and deal with these 2
some stomach trouble , i 'll see a doctor today ( maybe something wrong with budapest 's tap water ,
awesome : - )
normally they have that 'vivid ' tag on them
bleh ... the problem is we need a concept of `` discouraged usage ''
well the webcam does n't work , wifi does n't work after suspend , and wifi barely works pre-suspend
ok !
you 're busy enough and have enough things to do that it does n't seem worthwhile . if you were
installing
do you want the encrypt seen from windows and linux/
give me a sec ...
yes , xubuntu 14.04 is very lightweight and stable .
it is , actually . i just thought i would get better < performance , latency etc . > with
a good start would be to pick the patches and let affected users test it , then got for the
there 's actually not much in there aside from constructing some closures for the uniter
just turn it free , `` sudo chmod 777 /this/that ''
lamp have all of xampp facilities ?
yh pretty much , im basically at 6.2.1
t3.micro of ec2 is free for a year . you can try that
okay , lmk when you 've got that setup , we should mail the list on this change so it
^
are you on konversation ? because it had a bug
yeah gotham theme
not really , i have to go all over that again and submit another patch but i really dont want
tnx for the highlight
will you accept the patch if i am able to catch 99 % of the tests , ignoring the insane
also - if i thought it was just xubuntu i 'd have kept it 'in-house ' : )
i must be far enough north and east to not have dealt with them
the problem is suites
depending if you enable it or not users may be able to register or not
is that easy to fix ?
worker/peergrouper is the place to look
do n't believe internet rumours , especially about kubuntu , none of that bs is true
rogpeppe : res , plan to
: (
i 'd enable the root account first , and then just do an apt-get remove sudo , apt-get install sudo
'cause i can do that right now .
run `` sudo apt-get -f install ''
sudo lshw -c network
try your local ubuntu loco team
i have no clue what 's going on then , but on this instance it 's 100 % reproducible that
although perhaps it should be loki as he was god of mischief , and that fits the intermittent nature better
did you also do a full bios settings factory/default reset ?
you have backups . i would highly recommned a clean fresh install of 14.04 .
like you sued to root or something
why are debian and ubuntu have problems to use the packages from the repositories on their build machines ?
kodi is not ubuntu 's responsibility
or you could ask your mentor via the task comments
i 've programmed on linux for several years .
alright , well lets hope this works then ...
cool , sounds good then ; i was mostly interested in whether app/t/a was a single click , or comes
ok it could be that
they are probably either in /etc or in your home folder
i have n't specifically tested
`` sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras ''
5 years support on 14.04.3
i heard from dobey that if you use c++ , it 's not possible to package something that works with
not seeing unlockmodems though
and is as old as me : p
which logs ?
d'oh
so also telephony-service got installed , not just ubuntu-touch-session ?
kk
dimitern oooh
no , he 's a repeat
what is this - cctv stuff ?
if your mic does not appear in the settings , maybe you have 2 soundcards ?
if your time is more than 15 mins skewed from the server could cause problems
mmmm its decent , but a bit fandangled .
your disk image is too small .
no it is an usb2 hub , but it has 2 1a ports
if i
the installer does that
i.e . lsmod | grep nvidia
can you ask them to pop on here ?
i 'm in the middle of 3 things right now
hey
i understand , and that 's being fixed , but atm we 're talking about *where* the blob is
how are you mouting it ?
did that , but still no effect
done
added a review
or did you have to play with firmwares
btw , there seems to be an army of just me in the jp channels ... hehe . typical .
ok awesome , doing it as we speak
was it in the release pocket ?
thx , worked
nope .
/dev/sda
we talk about development , not users
yes . but for the small fullspeed lte time i would not pay more for a device to have lte
i do n't need that , just `` adt '' or so is enough as hostname ; i just want
because those are that channel 's rules ... .
you are obviously confused on the definition of 'delete '
is compiz works on arm v7 ( raspberry pi 2 ) ?
but in the case of a long list being filtered , also the contenty of the flickable may change.. but
fix it !
if the port is succesfull , sure
np : )
it is to bad intel graphics are n't as good
the visible-file-exists branch looks good but i have n't tested it ... i assume you did ?
they claim to be submitting bigger urbs than we submit to the device right ?
both users zachary and subsonic can raed the directory yes . the application subsonic fails to run a media scan
yeah i meant gpl
im on my phone at the bar right nkw so i cant look into it . maybe someone else would
kgunn : i noticed there was also a failure on ppc64el , is that the same issue ?
yep should land shortly , i asked slangasek to review , should n't take long
you 're on the right track . gtg
ok , i fixed the spreadsheet scripts , newlines are now properly handled
yep
ah , i 'm just having a hard time following is all , you may have better luck with another
try sudo rm filename
u on 14 or 15 ?
yes , however , i believe nvidia-346 is the latest under 14.04 repository
yeah , add remove is where you have some control
is that risky ? and does it matter that it 's encrypted ?
and your country of origin
you can buy an intel nuc too
i saw an article about amd on softpedia , maybe that can help ?
can you boot into recovery mode ?
same as before
we could get rid of that as well if automation clones all repos
sorry man i dont know how to do it , after reading the link u sent
will appear in incoming soonish
i 'm even worse ... i usually create a click package with only a main.qml file in it ... install
not on the underlay branch , surely ?
you can `` msgunfmt /usr/share/locale-langpack/ < locale > /lc_messages/* '' to get the list of strings for < locale >
then i should not do persistent install : )
you have something not configured correctly since you created the maas user manually
i only pasted these two lines
yeah , i know that feeling : )
goodie
nope , no previous versions
it does play locally for me in the html5 player
that does n't work at all .
ssds
and make sure you do n't overwrite an existing key
oh , and i 've built the s390x kernel package ... it did n't build me the kernel image /
worker/uniter/hook/hook.go:54 : undefined : hooks.storagedetached
nobody will be late
basically `` ignoring what the page says is the last commit , is the content actually correct ''
could be the screen got broke too , do n't you think ?
do you have plasma 5.4 machine connected with hdmi to tv maybe ?
yes . you 're trying to get something approved . but approved to where ? what website is that ?
did i permit it where ?
pretty sure it 's the same cause
i can abort and re-start . it may be faster because i have some other mounted folders
i 'd rename the kwin and plasmashell configuration files and see if that fixes things .
i 've seem some pcs recently using ntfs for the efi-sp though ; make sure you do n't have such
phone is supposed to be single surface per app , per design
what does `` ls -l /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/dsdt '' report ?
will do
i used minicom to get into it while the systems are running
interesting
yes . i will add the 1.23 task to the bug
and if i create it on devel , will it work on rtm ?
oh well if it 's not in phone images then i guess it does n't need qa
np : )
it will break . dont mess with the sources
to what extent ?
er , i had a couple interruptions , but sanity on 198 is going well so far and the issue
\
stgraber did n't reply and doing cancel on the tracker does n't work
can you please try installing it if works for you ?
yeah , 14.04 is supported through 2019 afaik .
and `` cat /etc/issue '' ?
for some reason inside added machine
it 'll be easier to check after an archive cycle or two when our reports update .
yeah , but it lasted for two weeks , no ?
so i can recreate it with fdisk ?
are there other zip files in the trash ?
any knowledge of the tech in the the chromecast ?
sitter : is there a short doc how to use the pkg-kde-tools to update the qt/kde symbols files ?
just put 'yes ' in column k
it 's like motif was cool and there were themes to make it look nice
pinyin is only used to type chinese , and we are seeking to change the default for chinese
if i 'm copying the handler code , i might as well copy everything apart from the core
and do a force ?
no idea what wifi you are using or how the school has it configured
well using x forwarding to control a command-line app is frankly insane : - )
my browser offers a user+pass dialogue for that , ca n't you enter that and download it that way ?
there are some firefox addons that do that
bottom line , remove the old webdm and install the new one , until we fix that
alrighty
i assume he is using the pre-installed one
right , so i 'm wondering if propagating force is required at all
depends what you want the vm to do
its a short list .. no errors
'smartctl -- test=long /dev/sda '
no , it depends entirely on which applications you 're using
yea
apparently
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso i might try this on my guest
so if you did two pushes in rapid succession then it may be that github merged those into one hook
thats why im saying that
i 'll file a bug now : )
that 's from silo 22 ?
hm that might be networking playing tricks
i never would have guessed that
does say we have one they do n't
have you checked the window managers options ? there are a lot of them in fusion or whatever these days..
he keeps ongoing records of events . he needs those . yes
or during the grub screen ?
i do n't understand , so what was the machine ? a kvm ? an openstack instance ? a machine
i guess not ... ogra_ and sil still on holidays
did you restart it ?
it says think name or service not known
np
i was there saturday , sunday , monday , tuesday .
pay me one billion dollars and i will try to make that happen ; p
i do n't understand that sentence
not me personally . i 'm sure there is a way to do it .
that will clear any environment such as alias that you set manually ( provided you did n't add it to

yeah , is is oddly slow
whereabouts are you ?
mh , well yeah , but we 're having the issue event with no scaling at all

you can download the packages on another box and install them

also i was unsure what was going on , there is no place to see if an import is ongoing

it will be named `` settings '' or `` system settings '' in your start menu

yeah , really it 's one of the last major features missing from media-hub

*blink*
he gets an error . the same one plus something about initializing opengl .. and the question does he want
^
do n't use locval socket on python
can you describe the errors you get a bit further ?
ctl+alt+t then amixer
i do n't understand
alt + w opens window menu.. alt + h opens help.. etc
but it allowed me to remove and reinstall docky
so do n't use it , use some other medium
well now i can reproduce so i should be able to fix it
the pidgin news is lovely then : )
ty
so , if the problem was release/release.gpg disagreeing occasionally , that will go poof .
and ... what does `` botched '' mean to you
~22 seconds
the man pages for these two things do not give any default directory .
so you booted in efi mode then ?
ok , let me mark it so then
sod 'em . run mediagoblin instead . : - )
oh hang oooooon ! did the system boot in uefi mode ? sda looks like it has efi system partition
check if there was an update that change the config on you
after 7 days uptime i wanted to restart my system . i am able to switch to an other console
right , what i 'm trying to sort out with you si the actioncontext.active state : )
yes i have done that
you toss it a script , and looks at its exit code
so i assume it 'll be osmething like tests/autopilot/music_app
am i right that snappy is not suited for graphical applications right now ?
but previousvisibleheight does n't depend on the item . the next item will have it set from a onvisibleheightchanged call

my important files are all in a clould backup , if the windows 7 cd does n't fix it ,
click on `` test result ''
maybe ! i always do my installs manually : )

can you open the embedded terminal in dolphin ?
perhaps it might have tripped up the autohinter occasionally .
plasma 5 is good looking and promising
which it can do
come to think of it , i could make it trigger whenever the game process is in the background ,
says right there , latency is 141ms ( time )
nope sorry
^ so that 's the only remaining ubuntu delta
ok , sorted ( and left : - ) )
well i *only* replace 0replaceme in wily : -p
it 's probably easises to do it manually targz 1 part of large archive , then targz another part ,
now that second one is interesting as it seems related to the new addressable containers
indeed .
so apps work but not the browser ?
and it 's not feature complete on the ui side , because i wanted that to be in its own
thats possible . but more targetting , free up space .
it 's in the live cd . you will need the live cd so that the partition is unmounted
agreed
but no trackpoint and you get some coil noise ( if that 's an xps 13 ) which would drive
desktop , natch
try the # netfilter channel
and can you run apport-collect with the failing xserver ?
been a lot of spoon feeding .
indeed , i remember that we ( and debian ) were blocked because of the js stuff
so according to doko ( our toolchain expert ) this might very well happen
hacking the planet
might be a red herring -- a followup says that installing polkit did n't help
he was n't either
where 's `` we '' ?
so perhaps :
note the change in dependencies.tsv
i dunno
most packages will install the .desktop files automatically might be some broken package though
grep is useful , awk , sed , tail -f..
what 's the problem ?
but those are for ubuntu..
any idea ?
i was just asking if that is what you are doing today ?
stop the drama , you have been in control it is your responsibility , if you want help own your
legacy or uefi ?
ubuntu one only
mmmm ... no , if we use netman
not tried that yet - since there 's nothing to see
is there any other os installed ?
ack , i get it
so demote the binary ?
no the network is working find . command line controls are good . it 's just the networkmanager thinks there
i was more interested in some code : ) is that ubuntu phone stuff on launchpad somewhere ? it 's
some laptops allow the hardware for each device to be selectively disabled
sure they are
why would putting the cable in a refrigerated shoe work ? ; )
yes , mennos is already done , and i like perrito666s idea . that will go in and be tested
ohh ... well that is ubiquity . my bad .
meaning your up to date , now try to check your syslog and dmesg
when i install them through ubuntu 's `` additional drivers '' window , i end up with a black screen
come on . you did that already 10 times

from your nmap : 2222/tcp closed unknown
phone runs a bit slowly and sometimes freezes when displaying the install list . i do n't want app crap
then a user can exit from menu also
anything else ? otherwise it 's a wrap from me
search dpkg for what its called : dpkg -l | grep emacs
do you a have a trello account ?
your bokmarks are in the profile
jamespage , arges +1 ( for meeting )
just answer the questions
windows 8.1 actually
i suspected that : )
if you find that too onerous , you can install phablet-tools-citrain from phablet-tools ppa and it does this for you
what hardware are you using ?
in the sdk template example , you see them access mytype.helloworld
yes . correct . what about the swap space ? can i delete it ?
ok do `` apt-cache show mysql-server-5.5 ''
install dual boot first , set up the encryption in post install
right , would have to go outside the scope of this help for that , ie whatever they recommend ,
stfu or be useful . that 's how it works . i do n't pay you to give me useless
what is this ? p : writing config for windows 7 ( loader ) on /dev/sdb1.. i dont have winblows
suhweet !
that documents all the available forms , but you do n't have to use them : - )
you should join # plasma and ask about it there
it 's a tiny patch . assuming the bug has a simple reproducer , you may as well fix both
no i did n't take this day off , so i 've to ; - )
o.0
yeah , that broke the world
and you said you had put it in two different locations or run it from two different scripts or something
are n't you a nice person ?
no i asked a question
but it matters you 're using this distro ? : )
do you know if your change has fixed the regression ? it 's not clear to me from the ci
`` create '' , insert ip of you ubuntu machine ... .
seeing that setting in accounts now , yes
it requires work , so i wo n't get to it until tomorrow anyway ; )
and as i see it is translated properly .
how would i delete the log files ?
hmm..developer mode enabled ?
i 'd suggest you are an outlier
then put surfacefillmode on top of polite-close , please
so now `` nano /etc/fstab ''
but that 's not where we finished , is it ?
greyback_ : what are our main clone mode scenarios ( for phone ) ?
heres the weird bit ... libc6-dev-amd64 is the 32bit version
should n't build-failures like that be noticed quickly ? ( especially since it happened like 4 minutes after the upload
ok - what is it ?
let me see what i have
which permissions does it have , instead ?
presssing f6 at the splash screen , shows a few checkboxes/options and also shows the `` command line '' for
what 's the message if you try to mount it ?
somebody already complained about horizontal scrolling and i already fixed it
^
yes but drm ^
should we push to trunk manually once we 're approved ?
try to press ctrl+alt+f1 , then alt+f7
file a bug with the rationale against canonical-devices-system-image
i did n't see a bugreport ?
apparently i chose the wrong destination ...
you are not a developer
mine creates a bacon2d scene ... i mean it runs and passes i was just wondering if i could see
well i needed it for /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check
technically those can happen with regular desktops as well
not got that far yet
i. e. the problem is mostly that init.d scripts are usualy written in a way to *not* show stdout/stderr..
oh ok , cool , good to know !
on it .
something similar to compiz ?
yes , i see .
hah , no : )
you 'd have to call out to the terminal emulator as a command and run it in the background
keep talking ..
chrome ?
well after that set , just show a `` df -h '' in a pastebin : )
ok , give me 2 minutes
sure , updating the commit message now
boooooom . saved . : )
in this machine it 's the gtx 780 ti using the 340.76 driver
should be in the repos , and actually , not address that issue
not yet - not reported or run any tests lately tbh
but why does canonical have to go their own way on almost *everything* ?
well , it was giving the wrong answer before as well ( the fact to create the file would have
well that 's why my first suggestion was a new page for `` my landings ''
ok , 20 times it worked
that is what ubuntu chooses default with 6 gb mem
`` cat /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades ''
do you know how to start a hangout for a session ?
what might be causing this is this laptop has 2 right and 2 left button
desktop
of course , you can still use a boot loader . grub2 , gummiboot ( now systemd-boot ) , and
i know how to drive the system , i 'm just not uptodate on `` politics ''
any sane file manager will not skip or complain about empty subdirectories when copying .
and search for the hardware icon
yep , kids in denial
yw !
already resolved , removed the lib from -llibboost_iostreams
262 i can not access the device over usb
3rd party not supported .
so ... do-release-upgrade and the warnings will be resolved ?
could you elaborate on the problem , rather than the proposed solution ?
cool maybe i 'll order one phone then : d
can you try running this on 1.23 in worker/leadership ? : time go test -c & & for i in
why did n't you upload it to the store ? sounds like an interesing app ; - )
ahh , that 's perfect . i had constructed a wrong locale-gen command , apparently . so it did n't
welcome
desktop , phone , ubuntu version , desktop env ?
anyway . another solution is to create an internal window with ''xephyr :21 '' and then running ''display=:21 firefox ''
i 'll check .
works here
so if this bug will be fix in time , bq should sign-off too , right ?
fancy giving it a quick look^^
just do it ( tm )
really ? no better feeling ?
so i want those on the ssd
gabriel at one time suggested i either keep it on me ( currently it 's been made private ; vanity
i guess we can have updates through srus
ok , run : sudo apt-get install aria2
try sudo apt-get install libqt4-x11-32bit libsigc++2-32bit libpng12-0-32bit if on 64-bit
it 's a remote server with no x
no difference
trypreview works , at least ?
oh !
what 's wrong with your kernel ?
i pointed cyphermox at it anyway : )
so can you comment as to whether you installed ubuntu in efi or legacy mode ?
`` no. '' because it 's the debian method ? or `` no. '' because of skipping the intermediate step
sorry , omw
hm , and everything after events is blocked until events is shown ?
really ?
run the script again
you can install chromium using apt-get or the `` software center '' in the dash , you can get a
ah nice
not completely sure i follow : attempted restate :
if it 's the shared account , i can have a look
'df -h '
anyways , make it look like this : appmenu : close , minimize , maximize :
changes in the network_api_class . metadata agent configuration etc
please enlighten me , amen .
no log files to be read ? i suppose you probably have an off-the-shelf router , personally i feel uneasy
the ui could be better , but for wily only landings you should select `` no qa needed '' at
good point , i 've never used ios . will have to do some research .
live service died which stopped login on phones
without quiet splash , the system boots now : > ?
( bad system call ) . that is n't a seccomp denial
gparted is simple enough , but the installer _should_ be enough in itself
my schools it department ?
ok
that way others can help too
should be , but since i 'm usually the one who updates it , i would n't count on it
in the last 20 years , i literally never used ll at all .
the `` id '' ?
let me check
continue in # ubunt-offtopic . this channel is for ubuntu support .
weird layout from faluce , 2 intel cards ? ?
which mp did you change ?
so from conversation before , did-set-status flag is persisted in uniter local state
if it 's a problem of your making then no bug needed : )
made .sh of how i made the .deb if that matters , the rest i already told you
noted . i will probably have to use that line
cool . yeah , i 've added a new list to our community propaganda board and already added ucfs in
he ordered his samsung evo 850
you search something specific mate ?
crocodiles ?
not rly . i wanted to try something . is this kernel unstable ?
and yes , a custom is also needed
it 's in rw , should that change what reboots do ?
`` well , i 've purged , re-installed drivers and rebooted . same error. '' show me the error .
did you get apparmor working correctly ?
i thought xorg.conf is behind us ?
if you boot from ssd anyway , it does n't matter too much .
so i have a bunch of user directories in the home directory
did you get the demo script ?
and is it native for linux ? or windows only ?
afaik it 's a launchpad thing .
type sudo chroot /path/to/install
so , `juju authorised-keys import -- help`
does this return anything ? whereis avconv
it 's just that if you installed 14.04 when it was new , it can become 14.04.3 with the 3.13
and your copy of ubuntu-archive-tools is also running on that precise machine , and is not patched in any way
although we only really support systemd or upstart ; you ca n't install anything else
what 's the system you 're sshing from ?
*
looks that your desktop settings are 'borked ' somehow .
sure thing
it is quite complicated to boot without monitor
usually involve low-memory or high-load or huge background image for the greeter to load . basically anything to slow down
sudo service lightdm start ( or restart ) ... what it says ?
sudo ubuntu-drivers list just shows intel-microcode
not going to update it , so it wo n't break
if you make a seperate ntfs partition on that hdd , yes .
no
but do note that you can create your own image via ubuntu-device-flash
rockin dude you ?
any opinion on ntpd by default ? i guess systemd-timesyncd will suffice for the default server case then ?
have you tried bash -x yourscript_witherrors.sh
it needs the environment to check this capability , so we move the question from machine.go into the addresser worker
i 'll drop the option from trunk but wo n't roll it out until later
multi-environment stuff is killing me
great
add this line to the desktop file : x-ubuntu-supported-orientations=portrait ( or landscape )
iirc , lubuntu follows me , if you want me to tweet ?
nope , thats not what i am looking for ; )
what card exactly ? or what driver does suit the card , maybe xorg edgers contains the driver version
i guess you could still get at them with alt-something
maybe nomodeset and no_acpi aswell
this is on debian
great
ok - did n't know about that flag and it looked like it was adding one . my bad
ubuntu ships adb and fastboot . if the tablet can handle that its eas
you sure ? different qt versions does n't sound fun
oh !
does silo 3 have the fix in it ?
but 192 ... is usually local ip and that works fine for
placement explicitly overrides constraints though , so i do n't think it makes sense ?
yeah , which sounds like a problem ...
( this is how we do keystone )
... and it 'd be best to use sbuild in the future to avoid the issue : )
mirv and keep the same source in trunk . then when we create a silo we provide the mr for
that should boot to a minimal x environment with just ubiquity running .
check 'top ' command
so no way to have two available networks with the connect automatic but prefering one over the other
just possibly : )
your daily build is n't fully updated
so you come from a non-technical backround ?
no they 're always 1:1
i 've not checked /properly/ , but the patch should apply cleanly to trusty as well
have a poke about in some packages and see how things are bundled
you are purple ?
no problems . good luck !
less than 5 % i 'd say
sadly not
the reason imap-before-smtp is used is so people putting in their email stuff on their phones , etc , do
just to make sure , you have n't flight mode enabled , do you ?
for the moment , i just use $ snap_app_data_path which exists and is writable
hope did delete your mac-id before .
try autoremove
and provide a way of populating some test data
trying the raid 1 install without any encryption or lvm . just 4 partitions on each hdd ( /boot ,
have n't put fingers to keyboard yet ; that 's how i propose to do it , will update doc
ship it
ah , cool
yeah , created a new silo , copied the binaries over and published that instead
you sure you hit the correct bug ? bug 1425047
2 questions
you are trying to build ubuntu touch for x86 as it looks ?
hmm , you can kill the upgrade window . looks pretty dead to me .
is n't the renderer copied in initramfs ? ( i did n't go to that part yet )
wait a sec : what is : apt-cache policy libvpx1 : amd64 libvpx1 : i386 ;
so that means nothing
it is doable , but if you wan na help me update the wiki i posted here earlier , you
the idea would be to cherry-pick the necessary change in to stable for both c-h and the charm ?
you can do a manual search using `` for d in /sys/bus/pci/devices/*/ ; do echo $ ( cat $ d/vendor
do you know also if it is possible to install whatsapp ?
gnah , the api server has been initialized with the public eth0 address of the maas controller , not its
as a whitebox test using the dummy provider
maybe i should add a possibility that you guys can pass additional arguments to xgettext
yes , broken .desktop files do n't show up on the dash
k
what is the output of `` dpkg -l vlc '' then ?
5ghz is still an unlicensed spectrum
ok
yes , a recent ubuntu touch installation should have no mir version older than 0.12 on it . the 0.11
confirmed your branch works
no one knew there
and also , there is a common workaround in bash of returning something to be evaled
i ca n't be blamed for the upstream code
but no one is there right now
ogra_ sergiusens : ^
and be careful with omission of / trailing slashes until you 're familiar with it
cool , no idea here , sorry .
yeah service is up but not responding , and there 's a relevant security group rule
done
i see you can do :
but wo n't that reset the gl context anyway ?
so you have to say header.layout.leadingactionbar.actions : [ ] to set the leading actions
typically service $ service stop
i 'm back in europe on monday
no fat32 is windows readable
but the release is getting together
are you trying to make it boot again , or just get data off it or what ?
it 's for ubuntu loading usb 's
ah yeah , that is a trek . its not far , but with traffic and no direct roads ,
nope , that 's a lie
that is odd
but do n't we work around that in other builds already ?
stop it
how can i tell which one it 's using ? somehow i suspect not flash
too late : )
i dunno about this , if i use format disk after format my laptop can not mount usb anymore only
you rebel you lol
development mainly . autopilot . unit tests .
so any idea why when i restart the service i have sideloaded as a snap i get an error ...
possibly 12 ...
stratum 16 is unsynced
is that the full diff ? why the hell did n't the train get that ? wtf ?
welcome to ubuntiania
you say we can run those tools on host ?
well i could leave a comment that says `` me , too , '' but the bug reporting guidelines suggest
if you need an exact definition for autoremove just run the command man apt-get and scroll down .
do you have the hangout link ?
without a backup , you consider your data not being worth to be kept .
backup only goes one way - from source to destination . sync goes both ways
not a fan of sharks ?
there is a bug with snappy on azure that needs to be fixed , that we have been trying to
then `` sudo apt-get update '' , then `` sudo apt-get install nitroshare ''
because it was the only way to get docker working : ) and its a important package for us
ok..
woah wait what happened
i do not see how to do that without using history model or changing the code
if i 'm not mistaken , you actually did work on our servers
have a link for the 1st lug
root
your /dev/sda4 contains a corrupted ntfs filesystem , which needs to be checked .
look for vmware files and i purged them , sudo rm -rf vmware* ... it was drastic but it was
it probably is n't , but since we 're still manually merging branches anyway i 'm okay with fixing conficts
yeah , for me too if i use the commandline
ok ...
test_shellprofilechangesreachindicators ?
are you using the 5.3 ppa ?
^^
it does n't work . it asks me the password for oem ...
also i did a binary copy of the right version thinking that 'd save time , of course
why are you asking me
do you delete the original downloaded isos or something ? lack of disk space ?
`` debian/packagekit-tools '' it 's copying into that other .deb
got it
open softwarecenter > edit > sources , and see the tab authentication , you have the keys , if you
do you know if all the changes have been applied in all three branches ( 1.22 , 1.23 , master
where is it extracted from ?
lol , good point ; - )
if that did n't work , do `gpg -- list-keys` and find the one relating to mongo .
its like uploading a photo , just with text
access to the i386 host might be useful too if that 's possible
inverse square
and would n't install ...
the owner is important like i said
that 's good to see : )
i was thinking about it where do i find this setting ,
yeah , have a look at juju livetests as well and you the open stack test services are used in
done much with the install since putting it on , or was this graphics driver angle the first thing you
i am going to repush the succeeded packages with archive versions later
ca n't hurt , there 's only a few . but more interesting are the enhancements to list
nope , gon na give it a try
ok. 'ls $ prefix ' ?
jep
or how the code worked at all
it is two cards and i did i have a 970m
otherwise , we have had a few xfce packages land , and are about to have a few more .
! i retract my former statement ...
type cd first to go to your home dir , then run the script
yes , it goes through the downloads in command prompt but then it gives me that error
this is for azure
^
i can use my dektop ui to access the remote engine
this is a personal branch
ah , ok
but i 'm using ubuntu
yeah , could be fun when you have two apps open and you press pause ... then play etc lol
aaah , ok ... zbenjamin : kalikiana : so we can exclude include freely seems
yeah , that sounds good
if you ran that after sudo apt-get update then you alreay have the latest updates installed
ok , will upload in a sec
well , the hook did n't fail so something else is afoot
right but search filters
glad we drooped the `` `` stripping
why not ?
that 's good to hear : )
or i guess i could remove the `` also affects libavg '' ( if i figuered out how )
often times you could find some precompiled material in places like rpmfind.com or rpmseek.com , regardless of the name ,
if you need anything else , let me know , otherwise , have a good night : )
would you be interested is some sort of session where a group of people who do test are about to
just use the nivida contole panel the change the mode
ok
definitely not one that requires sooo much efforts
mine was under `` boot options '' - > `` security ''
you mean , initiate task select ?
*blink*
you do n't just throw newer kernels on when you like : )
i have updated the details in the spreadsheet already .
do you think you could move the card to in progress to reflect the status ?
+ juju ssh -e maas 0 'cat /var/log/juju/all-machines.log '
because people is retarded ?
i believe you got my point , come on : )
take say the length of the iso is 123456 tnen you 'd have to dd if=/dev/cdrom bs=1 count=123456 | md5sum
is that with the latest xfce4 available on 15.04 aswell ?
old versions are not up to date . if you want something for recovery it may suit your needs
i mean , it 's an option you can turn off , and it prints out how to abort the
no , cause it wants new qt = )
ask bq why they build their kernel with nfc support enabled
sounds like you are missing a default route . can is the direct connected server using dhcp or static config
then the whoopsie change just makes it so that the oops id gets logged
it does , but the filtering by instance-id is not implemented by the ec2test server
or did the server shell script bail for some reason ?
whatever it is you 're doing , it 's clearly not an ubuntu issue , and we only support ubuntu
oh , nice ! for the release party ?
juju set juju-gui `` sandbox=true ''
i have , but it was a long time ago at this point
sure , as long as membership in that group implies they can submit code in the company 's name
more developers needed !
how woudl we add theming ? added id : plugin ?
we can update the update_apidocs.sh to pull from the ppa for that specific package , but it wo n't pull
while it seems your silo has the same thing
journalerrors > wow , this guy seriously needs to replace his hard disk : )
oh ok , im using chrome anmd for some reason the language isnt english which does confuse me abit but
hmm now it works when i replicated the way you ran the command
make sure your in /ubiquity/autopilot
ok , sorry i 'm a bit confused
if jamespage , gnuoy , or dosaboy do n't respond in short order i 'll land it
what was the error ?
just wiping the current os and installing the old one i guess
the nice thing is , you can cause the watch to only trigger on create events , rather than all
so vivid is fine now , and the tests will be fixed with the next upload ( not urgent )
sounds correct
because it 's the standard installed aimed at the majority of users
not getting payt to fix haha
ill remember to ping eric on that one
it just login loops ?
the issue is around using e.g . apt-get install -- target-release precise-updates/cloud-tools cloud-utils - it becomes apt-get install ' --
rarely nowadays , just lots of mud
need a question asked before that 's possible : )
try sudo blkid
maybe
lxd ?
in the setting of your connection in networkmanager you can specify your desired dns servers .
in my case , it was to be able to run aoe2 which does n't run in the native ubuntu
does that dependency mean anything to you ?
what will this do ?
thinking of a networkstate type in the network package , returned by state and containing all needed data
ok , unmount it
yes , did you try those aswell ?
your card has optimus technology
if you use the older firefox it might have vulnerabilities
you can copy/paste across partitions ... .
what did you do before the crash ?
website to stream movies and such
if its not set in the interfaces file its set in the network manager
can you code at all ?
is any other installed ?
can you print from any other application
yeah
you free now ?
the best of it is now you 'll be thinking of that any time you see the term i want
just loaded a disk into the drive .
but the opensource drivers still avalaible for lts right ?
you can remember it in a pinch ( which is the only time you 'll need it ! ) by
^ it 's pushed now so no complaints , but for the laughs : p
what is that link for ?
i 'm sure pitti wo n't mind more debian-specific stuff in systemd
that 's a network issue with launchpad , nothing to do with dual ( well you might see it more
same error
ha , i still do n't know what im doing : p
fair enough . can the installer image for 12.04 that was on the laptop be reacquired from somewhere ?
okay , now what ?
i have no idea at all .
as long as whatever is serving the content can read it , it can really go anywhere
are you trying to view it ?
even rebooted : )
something fundametally wrong with that diska array , only hitting 46.183 mb/s
does the scope overlay to make a `` squircle '' ?
they lied . mint is not supported here .
but if the location bias could be looked at later - less of an issue ?
a full hdd could have several issues yes .
yes it is , but we only use that for xenial
is there a way to tell apt to use specific version ? 14.04.1 instead of 14.04.3 ? is is something
did you configure that system with a raid array ?
i figured you were , this channel just has some whom do this and it is well no helping really
looks like you might have had some insight there , so if you are blocked , it would be a
that is usually sensible advice : )
ah , i 'm afraid i 'm not aware of that kind of usage
a new sru cycle will start next week
do you know why the icon section says `` only svg '' ?
i thought you had something to be changed for checkbox - dependencies ?
does n't answer the `` why ? ''
juju-quickstart takes -- upload-tools flag ?
programmers cant help you more than `` all the others '' in here .
i 'll do that this morning
are you not our official contact person these days ?
no , i have a few already .
poor them : )
you 've been told earlier , maybe
ok
wait 1 ... screenshot coming
how do i do that from command line ?
can you try to reconnect ?
you suspect windows 10 is doing some power saving that windows 7 is n't ?
still ca n't see them , have you saved the comments from the box for regular comments ?
yeah , got that from the paste you did anyways ; ) and those are the same as mine on
there is none . the system service daemon runs the nagios process as the nagios user . there is no
yes , i915 is the driver for many recent intel gpus . although , there are a few common warnings
then set it
what cpu are you running ? i can verify whether or not you 've got the necessary extensions .
lucky catch i guess : )
xsane is funky , i had to do a wipe and load of the config i believe to get it
but ok , i hope robru happens to be here back soon so we can publish the silo
somehow : )
hum hum , is n't that going to be arm for x-building ?
do not know , at least do not remember why
what 's the url of the new distribution 's primary archive 's admin page ? ?
thx
i do n't see a option in bios where i can turn uefi mode off ? by the way when
it was recommended to me to install encrypted so thats why im doing this
i just wanted to follow up because we were still in the alpha stages when i did a lot of
you did n't receive the rejection rationale ? ( iirc , i commented i did n't review it )
since we already got bit many times by some of the ppa short-comings which we had to work-around , like
so i can just ignore lp : unity-api for now
yes
ok , let me check the libraries see if they support it
as i understand tjaalton there is nothing there
no change in the ui yet , no apparent log messages either
if you do n't care about uninstalling it ever , sure
are you having to gateway the iscsi traffic ? or something else ?
right
if no change then you already had the newest gcc in repo . you can compile or use the ppa
i still would prefer doing it `` right '' in c , but at least this is provably non-invasive .
i have n't gotten into that state myself , unfortunately
yes , i 'm working on it . i 've cleaned the patches up a bit . the main bit
i loved the size of my sony cmd-z5 : )
no , not yet
sorry , what wo n't take longer ?
what edit program can i use ? vi/gedit/nano are not available . or would i have to use sed to
sudo chroot /mnt
hmm ...
no problem : )
sorry..i should add more ... '' without run & locking them ''
seb128 has powers to do that
what happens if i remove network-manager ? there is nothing to manager the interfaces ?
i use weechat : )
correct .. and the updater is trying to go to 14.10 whuch is rol and the repository is not there
basically the user interface , xubuntu uses xfce , ubuntu uses unity
anyway , are you fine with me adding the content in draft pages ? to have it somewhere else than
yeah xd i hope that a good one that has many users comes soon , i know vivaldi has a
if you have a shell on the phone you can kill the content-hub-service and restart it with content_hub_logging_level=2 content-hub-service
haha , atari ! ?
understood
what if i just disable vsync on compiz , will that do the job ?
yeah some requiered packages
ouch
btw , you can change default apps in settings : )
oh ! it 's mardy !
fwiw , unless you have multiple commits i 'd find it handy if you simply sent a git format-patch
i 'm a native spanish speaker
ah ok
it 's like it 's not letting me connect
mhhh
the linux memory manager is very good at spotting pages not in use and swapping those out - better allocate
what project ?
what 's the output of gdbus call -y -d com.canonical.systemimage -o /service -m com.canonical.systemimage.information
right , that 's definitely the hardest bit
do you have latest updates in wily ?
i have no idea which system you are one , which system is having the issue of being unable to
the toolbar does matter
this is only on wily ?
maybe , but we do n't control the public jenkins
i deleted everything with ? manually
ah yeah it 'll be autopilot only , but that is still *really* useful
he is , but he 's off today , so i 'm unsure he 's going to get to it
snappy itself is not touch fw_setenv/printenv at all
absolutely : ) most of all , i learned that c++ and debuggers are a deadly mix : )
habbasi you add `` nouveau.blacklist=yes '' at the boot line
this is specifically about earth
so if i updated to ota4 , i update to ota5 ok
i expect you to know really .
yes
how long do you think would it take to fix this bug ?
settings > appearance > behavior > menus
expect a mail from me in the morning/
at least functionally ... just cleaned up the api of the function
and it does seem like patch-the-world problem to me
in stead of wasting your time immediately focussing on clamav , just make a note
just otp right now , will look in a few
get the non-efi iso
i am not typing anything either : ) i run the uitk test plan script and it does it all
ah yes ... there is a monogame-pipeline.deb now ... what do i do ? just double click it ?
ah , so waiting for landing
that does n't happen yet , then previous /dev/sda1 still exists .
k
in the overlay ppa yes
never heard of it , can you provide more details to the channel if you want support here ? :
victor says `` ha , because cmake was a pain in the ass and was n't very well supported in
also what wireless adapter is this ?
you can use wine to run windows apps on linux .
mount the usb in nautilus
people are whining there 's been no sprint summary email . i told them we 'd wait for doc and
no
link parsing is spot on , +1
okay ill uninstall and use the package manager then
definitely qt still..
have execute take a recursion_level param and check it on entry
okay so right now i 've booted linux from the live usb to `` trial '' it . i 'm
where will you get that information from ? can it differ from ro.sf.lcd_density ?
which means it temporarily disables the default archive
resize2fs resizes a filesystem to the partition size . if the partition size has n't changed resize2fs wo n't do
did you read man bash and man apt-get ?
2 weeks ? why does it take so long ? can you link some info about the ubuntu kernel release
ask # bash for specifics
well , that test is going to be very useful on the change that i am practicing now
linux works in much more hardware set ups than windows , what are u talknig about ?
for the others we use the normal cloud images , and just a setup script to clean them up
then you can safely ignore my comment . : d
pulseaudio
so that 's a. i 'll look at that
g1
your answers were just useless and boring
well if *maas* thinks you 've run out it usually means you have
i seem to recall running a configuration with some debug packages installed and i ran into a lot of issues
are you singleboot ubuntu or dualboot ?
if you have access to your router , then you can use your existing computer as an ssh server .
btw i get this in xsession-errors :
no , the video ca n't even be decoded by youtube and also it contains metadata like the cop car
else , if i could get catalyst to take ( install ) i could just use that .
i just checked with android , they do it power+home ( at least old , + samsung ) , new
yes
supports any .iso
i face problems configuring the network part .
it already will be , check network manager since this is desktop ubuntu
sorry , my brain was still tangled with the write-on-get code
no idea . i tried , but < shrugs >
the only reason i can think of for versioning uuids is so you can extract metadata ( e.g . the
fair enough
ignore unrelated panic ,
nope , you can ask a question and wait like everyone else
nice . latest version . do this : dpkg -l | grep blender | nc termbin.com 9999
awesome ... how do i do that ?
because we 'll eventually upgrade to 14.10 . either we 'll do it or our host server will do it
why ?
super is the windows key .
which will trigger a failure in the race detector if the appropriate mutexes are n't used
well , `` mean '' in the sense that it serves the same purpose : i get to know what
makes sense ?
so i was discussing with greyback a name for that property
the allow lines have no effect , since -p accept is on
do n't install grub , as it 's the legacy one , install grub2
osomon : at least on gnome , almost all my apps are using the same proxy settings , which i
i barely even giggled
yeah , it 's a lesson nobody wants to learn the hard way , but all to often , that
that last one sounds like an eminently sane idea
you need the myphotos scope
+10000
correct
yeah that 's what i was thinking
your interfaces files is most likely messed up
i do n't suppose you know where to go to kick off those image builds ? i 'm totally spacing
is this fine ? 127.0.0.1 mail.dogeclouds.cod mail localhost
so you changed to gnome shell after install or installed the gnome shell iso ?
sudo is fine
k , lmk what happens . maybe menn0 did fix it : )
ok , i 'll land but then do an immediate followup
bombs away : )
confirmed , click has that change
i tested and approved the calculator update
# ubuntu-app-devel
i flashed with `` ubuntu-device-flash touch -- channel=ubuntu-touch/ubuntu-rtm/14.09-proposed -- wipe '' and the flag exists

no new images have been built
they are good laptops besides this oddity ! : ) i also tried booting on another dell i have here
correct
that 's ok - it can wait : - )
hmm , yes , so it does : -d
no just use alt-shift-tab
both fix signifcant issues i 'd really prefer to not be in 15.10 beta 1 tomorrow .
do you have any findings ?
then do that and you are done . : )
cat /etc/fstab and paste on paste.ubuntu.com
and i am sure it uses kdm
judgement call , usually no
yah . otherwise , nginx 's proxy_cache is really sweet . reduces server load by like 95 % .
there is a means to boot to terminal in 15.04 , but i do not know ... others will have
groovy , this is an ec2 cloud computer and we 're sharing a screen , can you see it installing
delivered ?
i just clicked rebuild and it built fine
i 'm checking now
belgium has a company 'coolblue ' very acurate , even on sundays always deluver the day after
okay . i 'll try that .
wait until 3 before complaining though
check official website for your card
tried reinstalling ?
nothing , but your insult machine can surely blame sdk team for it anyway ! : )
that looks like a namespace change issue
i agree but i remember having this discussion some time back where we wanted to make each app 's alarms
this would account why the support board is so old ...

have you tested how fast it is to copy the ntfs source drive to something else ?
sudo modprobe -r modulename
i guess he 'll find a way : )
yes at ubuntu purple screen hit esc or f1

i know but i 'm only using it local so far : d
i have 4 gb 2 days back but now my one port is damaged so only one port is working
do you want explanation , or just a workaround ?
oh them ... for lfs setups i guess .
anastasiamac : i did a benchmark and on 20000 splits , regexp takes 0.06s longer . i 'm ok with
ok ; and why did you not take what you 've done to make xubuntu-core smaller , and make that
so how should i approach the install ?
google problem not ubuntu problem . ask google
yeah , hopefully ; just a warning
actually , based on your mdstat , it looks like the last two drives are set up as hot spares
that 's okay . still appreciate your help .
you mentioned being queued up for an sru , but i 'm on wily/rolling
it was i18n.tr ( ) vs i18n.gettext ( ) and we ended up using tr ( )
no worries : )
i am not falling or getting arrested
if i issue the reboot command in my control panel same user logs in and reboots the machine .
exactly .
will do a reinstall
wait for balloons to be on irc and ping him
will you be using this drive with windows ?
is this just a temporary thing ?
hah , i do n't think i can claim labor day as a holiday just because i 'm *in* america
tests are just hanging.. nfi what they 're doing
at least , that sounds like a familiar thing from a past life .
and all that is training in packaging and versioning to me : - )
the block size is just a buffer , to make the copy a bit faster , it wo n't make
sure
no worries . enjoy : )
what version of ubuntu are you using ?
sysvinit is deprecated on ubuntu
my suggest is , find a bug that affects you ( bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu and bugzilla.gnome.org ) and try and fix it
oki !
i do n't have the same menu , that 's the point : ( wait i 'm going to tell
enyway , if you can put an instance to execute the tests it would be great to compare results
hopefully i 'm wrong
the greatest truth never told is the version # is just a text file : p
in your terminal : man dpkg and read
it was on p2p2
ops , sorry : /var/log/syslog
of course , removing the duplication would mean that would just be a fix in deployer
so over the weekend i played with bcache
use vlc ?
yeah , that 's the one without an assert set , the other ( with isalivedoc ) is in ipaddress.ensuredead
can you try `` sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get upgrade '' in a terminal ?
what 's the exact question ?
if the existing directory is $ home/.steam , rename it to $ home/.steam-backup and re-run steam . it should then
support only please , chat in # ubuntu-offtopic
what do i have to do with that link ? open it ?
yeah
because i hate it when people tell me to just `` run something newer ''
emanuel_ you could also test running it without swap by issuing sudo swapoff doing another print , etc . if
then id argue its way behind , given that from a network admin perspective , pre3 from last year adds
ever use clonezilla ?
i 'm not using the terminal , im using the additional driver tab in software & updates
one runs ubuntu , the other snappy ubuntu core
i have them queued up and was just waiting to get it out of new
no , that was an update for an image that was already there
it*
how will you tell it ?
no , file a bug about him not being cloned yet fo example : )
not at all ; that is a very obscure hardware config , and a terrible one too !
how does this component know that ?
this then gets into the question of how big do we want snappy-debug to be
can you at least have a mp set to work-in-progress for now ?
do we have a bug for this already ?
that should give you the new snappy with the better error reporting
*every* day is fun at work day !
if so , it 's unorderable i fear
i dont see any updates in the system settings
the requirements file needs to be coupled with a list of debian packages you need on the outside to build

well , it 's certainly a compiler issue . it ca n't find a package from the standard library .
it 's a very old lts , 12.04 or 14.04 are better .

u can do that
no . no automatic distro upgrades . you have to manually permit that . sudo do-release-upgrade will work

this is ubuntu support . ubuntu only
i like the proper use of lxc ... instead of lxc ... ; )
ubuntu phone to the rescue
lts are 12.04 , 14.04 and 16.04 will be . all others just have 9 months support
it 's not on topic here either way : )
i really dont think so

i have a few servers , ( linode mostly , also use colocrossing , via servermania ) and link them

yep ( i ca n't pip from the server , it 's blocked )

nope

then the correct setting is `` publish without qa '' instead . ok , i can set the overlay for

i saw the badges in the advocacy kit , but not the banner ... .
i do n't even get that
check if you have tlp or laptop-mode installed .
it literally just has a for loop and calls dch once for each author
ah ! that makes more sense now : )
i really ca n't stand being on a machine without one now : ( ruins you like proper resolution screens
aha so i should do an uefi ubuntu . can i add it to the curent installed ubuntu ?
will post the full patch in a minute . let me try it out
no worries , glad this check saved us from clobbering your previous release ; - )
there is a fix system there . a cli and rw i would run apt-get -f install as well ,
my only guess is that it 's because you have a debian/watch . nobody else does . without it ,
netflux us seems to have a jolly publishing delay , latest series is 7

easiest solution would be to use 'sudo '
does that mean you are trying to hide her porn links and not yours ?
is it possible to test the vivid backport kernel for trusty ?
?
btw , i really object to random plasma libs using the kf5 prefixing
yup . suffering already but do i have a choice to ignore 'one ' op ?
just use autocutsel
not with the bot , but , i just use the search there at lp
basically the images highlight how the allwatcher sent the info about the nrpe charm in the watcher output
any eta on that ?
it seems to be reliably ( twince in the same way ) failing with a new error
we can never predict how much time it takes to process a single message *exactly* .
i rebuild ubuntu mate . it was published for all .
that what the app is using that i am using
and what is rc then ?
seems like they removed it from 15.04 +
so the hardware enablement stack ( hwe ) should upgrade your kernel to a supported version
i confirm is a nvidia card , that is true , i reinstalled the drivers as instructed in askubuntu.com .
better would be to filter the addresses we send from the machine , so we do n't send unusable addresses
different script
humph
it looks like resolutions are fine , just proportions thereafter are tiny ... checking
would be good if we had some small things like localizations , or output corrections .
good luck and enjoy
maybe you just ask your actual question instead ?
we could do two landings right after each other ?
gotcha
i 'm not a `` hero '' yet , so i have no idea : )
your turn , you get to tell people about the new site .
there is much yuckiness in gnome-system-tools : )
profanity ? no .
it should be : play play bork read fix play
oh goody
i 'm saying address tags should too
what ?
before all of this i tried installing the guest additions from the official virtualbox site iso . it can be
i scraped together all of my old computers spare parts and built one hell of a mutated machine
semantics assosciations of names r important ...
but that series , which defines distro ( trusty , precise , win2012r2 , etc )
does your card have optimus ?
14.04 lts ? i had the same issue , upgrading to 15.04 seems to have fixed it for the most
and it 's something that needs to be built in to run-checks ( passing -- builder ) so we all
and then it lies on me
hmm , no symlinks in /var/lib/apparmor

there is some theme that makes it look liek a breeze
if you like , defer to a follow up
aquarius : to avoid misunderstanding : ) the latest sdk runtime will come later to the lts ... the uitk
i mean , when booting the live usb

are you sure you client is not buggy and keep refreshing the notification or something ?
it 's only taken a week of debugging and morphis patiently fixing to get it landed \o/
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )

how can i verify ?

i 'll see to adding a fallback , like just blatantly ignoring them
yes , the idea is to make an image as soon as possible then from there put the original aside

where can i check the log ?
but that is the price of not backporting the uitk : (
excellent . so any other testcases causing you heartache within calendar ?
where is he or she from ?

ahhh , ok , it is n't flushing
huh . then something 's polling manually , cause inotify definitely does n't work on overlay . : p
i 'll keep on deleting stupid pages ; ) )
then i cant help at the moment . sure i will tell you if i have later on
unfortunately the console output is pretty vague
you 'd need the refresh ( ) to be there explicitly
ha , one problem with doing the version-in-header approach is that a new client with an old server will still
startx
right
a black screen is not somewhere you can do startx
do you get notifications ?
currently the certain amount is header.height/2 , and nobody complained about it yet
actually ... it does look like it 'll be one per ( hosted ) env
ok
dholbach : that is helluva weird ! ! !
yes
no it 's not it 's all text based chat and microsoft has better tech support and some of them
yeah sounds good
but it takes > 5minutes
yes ! i would love to do that
very .
sorry but you addressed me i was helping another and doing 5 other things , ignore me .
yes i had that problem until the last kernel upgrade
e_no_context
use paste.kde.org to give lengthy info
for 4 it 's system settings -- - > application apperence -- -- > icons
hum ... ... ... .. could not convert `` content/pages/security.md '' into markdown .
i 'll propose a change for that separately
exactly . all i 'm trying to do is make an ntfs partition
yes one of the primary goals is to be more streamlined than a spreadsheet .
oh sorry did n't know you wrote that code : )
sftp runs over ssh .
perhaps that would be better , but as the train is not enforcing such a policy , it should still
you mean `` not to backport the pu fix for 1.21 ''
you byobu has a raid item right ; )
yeah
i would go with 14.09-proposed and that needs 14.10 fw
switching to lightdm seems to have fixed it : )
so in 1.3 , it would be such that the app dev should use the theming stuff you showed in
plenty of info online for free then .
dkms does n't know about kernel 4.2
wallyworld can also help
/usr/sbin ?
first install gentoo or arch and get deeper to linux . than it wipp be easy
pastebin ip addr list
do you have some kind of unique or exotic hardware ?
yeah
the current is 10 , use that one .
hi : )
but works 100 % reliably with 3.19
sounds good . if someone else could step in for me this week would be good , but if no
so the preferred way forward is the embedded server
this is supposed to be a perk of working from home !
still failed . : - (
i guess i saw you come into mumble and my brain somehow failed
did n't get you at the shipping part . if you 're trying to ship the cover to india ,
plus its an old laptop my nebor threw away
sed is your friend ; )
anyhow , i 'll give pitti a poke for a review and his thoughts on the matter , maybe with
yeah looks like current sbuild does n't cope either
you mean php5 package ? because there is no php package
so there is no best practise of where to store this data then i preseume
i thought that 's what you said above : )
how come that pr has my `` already landed '' changes in it
i 'm not fond of port forwarding internally though i actually hate it
correct
can you explain more about bios update and kernel ?
so it has everything to do with your issue
but i have no way of income
my stupid irc connection keeps dropping
so do n't press reinstall in the installer , press on something else
it happens with any branch
`` account '' ? what account ?
i did . it only detected the two things i already had .
update-grub does n't install it to the mbr , you need grub-install as well .
a highlight on `` trainguards '' ; )
will we ever go back to the `` non-flipped '' model ? i suppose not , i. e. /etc/init/lxc-android-boot.conf is
no , they sing on some .
it crosses my mind
but do you mind testing access to dockerhub ?
did you use partitions or the entire disks for your raid ?
yes . i do n't fully understand this , i 'd prefer to do it in a different branch .
there will be option during installation ?
-sigusr1 wont kill it
yup
mmm so not a desktop i 'm familiar with - ok ridiculous idea , but power off and remove the
i 'm sure we talked about it ; if you 're on about the nvidia-settings versions ? the version of
are you testing on rtm ? i have image # 19 here and rvr was on rtm-proposed
not be ci and not with 1.23
linux is a kernel , gnu is a non-unix toolchain . gnu/linux is not unix , it 's unix-like
okay .
me neither that much , take a look and try to find repeated errors/
i 'll send it latter , sure
some wifi chipsets require different firmware to operate in access point ( ap ) mode .
so basically its , building your project manually in every chroot and then make install it all into the same
then re-run sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pastebinip
i do n't see you listed in the user list , but can see your messages .
i 'm not asking a solution . i just ask you if it would be possible for yoou to do
perhaps just do n't define deb_make_check_target and run the checks in common-post-build-arch : : ?
do i need change group ?
no , please have mp for lp : unity-api anyway so that we do n't forget
it 's related to all the cards , but we forgot to edit it in all the cards .
that is in the terminal
im curious , i see you have a plethora of knowledge
brb
pretty much , yes .
ok
oop my bad , i forgot - appearance
hexadecimal means it uses 0-9 and a-f. the address consists of eight , two didgit hexadecimal numbers
why not the metapackage ?
so you need a webserver . a server can be ssh , ftp , mail and webserver at once ,
so start it , it 's opensource and participation is highly welcome .
it did ? hm , so it sounds like i have something pinning those then . interesting
then again , we 've never had this anyway , so it 's not a regression
backup what ? the windows one has nothing on it except windows
yes , this is one of my concerns
: - )
windows system restore does n't really do what it advertises
blimey , i do n't have one
i guess the design was that for things simply starting on a runlevel , it 'd all be fine
no regression at all
alright , just a sec
start from your computer
at what point
for row 63 , just the dest ppa
it does n't fix this issue
we ( me and fillipo ) have discussed this at length
thx a lot
they will give it when law requires , it 's in their tos
yes
maybe i am in left field , but direct the cuda installer to that location for the headers ? ?
those machines are updating to latest trusty , running tests , and then reverting to the snapshot + rebooting
i 've just not reflashed to stock kitkat ( 4.4.4 ) and verified no recovery installed ( as expected )
on vivid ?
and set your name and e-mail
and this only applies to services which explicitly depend on network-online.target ( which is n't actually a lot ; but
there 's also 14.04
yeah i 've been trying to think of a weather related one
s public only gets populated with gulp i believe since an npm install did nothing with public
happy2help
ok then , during the ubuntu installation process it 'll ask you if you 'd like ubuntu to take up
do we have a mailing list ? : d x ( x )
eg . can we change the number of devportal-app intances form 2 to 1 without it exploding in our face
that 's the current discussion .
unlike we do ship with the ubuntu font
what are you dl'ing ?
that is just a dummy package , pointing to avconv
piracy discussion and other questionably legal practices are not welcome in the ubuntu channels . please take this discussion elsewhere
but do n't worry , he even has a git-format-patch waiting for him
you could use package depends/conflicts/ ... etc to make sure that new mir uninstall old u-s-c
indeed i can not see any difference from your screenshots
and if it 's software that will have lots of users , i do n't see how it actually solves
nothing ubuntu uses unity
if the doc is gone
one last question . why do you like legacy bios better ?
what is rep ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
yeah , i can see from the amount of landings you 're doing ! no problem . the new patch
apparently ubuntu does not log deletions . still , the files are gone . i can see the folder in
ack
sid has 0.8.0~dev650-1
sda would be the entire device ( no partitions )
probably `` sudo chown $ user /media/rich/backup2 ''
so what other steps should i do to get it up ?
that will remove the headerbar completely
do n't worry
seems the same with that env var set ?
thats where i get the error pharo-vm-core-i386 but it is not installable
it 's in debian , i must have d 'd it by accident before running debdiff
i know . it is linux 's one
i 'll do some more tests now ( manual partition , lvm setup and so on )
open a terminal and do this command : apt-cache policy krita | nc termbin.com 9999
hexchat
is it in backports ?
so look into the logs what was causing that hang . so you can remove the issue
i will give you a command try it
just normal usb burned with unetbootin and windows creation tool : )
reinstalled grub
i make the .img file on my own . then inside wmm i add it ? like going through that
try disable-mir-shared
hello mate
if you do n't mind , do all the text changes in the main branch
yes the -lts-backports are the very same trees just compiled locally
yep , you 're right : )
document viewer is n't installed , that 's why i downloaded a pdf
yep , sure does : )
i will not use the new ubuntushape then here
whats your question about partitioning ?
ok , still no update to it . it must be something holding it back . i wonder what though
yes indeed , going to have to do some homework to catch up on systemd .
alex_abreu : approved
i would simply look at my system , see if im maxed out in any relevant partitions , and empty
no , immediately ; i 'll work on it now
and its kinda geared toward gbp
stopped booting when , when put into the other system ?
i still have a laptop with windows . i spend too much time for gaming anyway ... so i would
trying to remember if i uploaded that , hang on
yep ! pas possible d'installer un nouveau recovery : /
?
the only problem i can see around there right now is a nagios alert for high load on that host
yes , that is a possibility .
^c ? : : shrug : :
they just use templates and caps
if that is what it uses ... here ( on gentoo ) it uses /var/run/networkmanager/dnsmasq.conf
say no more
any specific reasons ?
k hang on
see that java wiki , install openjdk-7-jdk
; )
yes , we 're fixing that
can not . sorry
if you point me towards what else is missing i 'm happy to have a look at it
mirco is here
please pastebin the output of `` sudo efibootmgr '' from an ubuntu livecd/usb .
nah , hibernate is disabled
try the second command
d
reboot would be usefull yes
hey !
it 's not a good answer , but you tried your hardest to break your system . like i said
then i do n't think we can help here
yeah , and here we have multiple possibilities
it 's an install i 've had for around 6 months or so
no support on desktop qpa : (
i 'm not very familar with how to navigate reports.sw
oh , that 's because ubuntu-gnome-bugs already has stuff shared with it
new
nice joke , if i knew , i will be outside paying : d
could it be that something changed in that regard ?
do that , i will call it a day soon too
but i had it installed , outdated version of sux
while 0 or any other value may be valid
how should i build then ?
nope
also , the fragment from xorg log looks like there is an edid sent . can you pastebin the entire
not windows8 just windows 7 with 64 bit , and windows was installed
state.connsuite logs the beginning and end of setuptest btw - e.g . with -check.vv

yeah ! now ya gone and made the package manager very unhappy .
ok , type ls -l /sys/firmware/efi
smoser : hm , wolfe-02 and wolfe-03 did n't come back from a reboot ; do you have a serial
no help yet , maybe some direction ?
you got it , sorry , my self-control is terrible .
yes
are you on 14.04.x ? `` cat /etc/issue ''
wan na be my gf
what happened
ok gon na boot back and hopefully no more system hangs when the ram starts thrashing ... it will make
lots of errors in the logs , but nothing *useful*
one more time for dput qtmultimedia source package from ppa : jhodapp/ubuntu/ppa to the silo 55 ppa , the build
looks okayish to me
i prefer to use @ ubuntu.com just to keep my number of e-mail addresses minimal
even more recent versions of mongo ?
it all works just fine on the local lan
preferred not to say . but it is not expensive internet
yeah : )
oh wait , can you post a denial ?
no keep it simple just backports
i do n't think the existence or lack of workarounds is a factor in whether an issue should block .
`` update-grub | & tee /tmp/ug.log ; pastebinit /tmp/ug.log ''
so then use the cli editor instead : sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
sometimes : )
try playing with your display properties under system settings .
i detached it via openstack horizon dashboard . i still can see the old ip by clicking on the charm
can you see my other app ?

do you think it would considered api breakage to fix that ?
ff errors should be asked at ff/mozilla support but wait 1 ...

this one was n't part of it
conflicting qt versions ?
there was a bug somewhere to make it less easy to shoot yourself in the foot but i ca n't
sorry
my guess is that amazon is returning `` no instances '' because you do n't have the default vpc ,
is that when it started ? try changing back to your original settings .

that 's a remarkably weird behaviour on apt 's part , though . i would n't have expected it to

im not familiar with those change bandwith notices
just moments ago , i restarted osx , went into my bios and selected my drive with ubuntu on it
je suis fatigue ' , comme tous le jeudi apre`s basketball
yeah you are right , it is from old past , when i started learning linux
all wrong partition types except the fat32 , that is where the iso and persistent should be . this is
do you ned it ?
yea - i 'm sure you 're ok
maybe it did happen before and i just missed it ( seeing the unit agent with the upgraded version )
you can do it during the mint install , or using the livecd of mint or ubuntu-studio .
i understand . however , it was my understanding he asked and there is nothing wrong with that knowledge .
that 's before you had a tablet , right ? : )
true
that 's the old version
ubuntu 14.04 server

oh ... i see ...
okay , now go to the other software tab
any bug reported about it ?
not as the workers died
yea let me grab a screenie
right , it 's not kernel panic , if that 's what you mean
interesting , so similar to how we produce desktop images
right , but where 's your yaml file

i do n't think unity default has one built in , but other de 's like kde , mate and
i hard could it be ? it 's only four drop down boxes on my router
which image ?
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
either way it does n't sound as if the kernel you installed is new enough . or you did n't
for me it triggers sound and vibration even after installing your patch . i tested this on my nexus 4
have you ever had problem with clamav and amavis updatings ?
thx
you should chat him up about gaming .
i believe so .
great , type update-grub
which means it will always complain in that sense
well that was an awful lot of info to lift from the back of my head , hope i did
ill do better , ill do one for me based on breeze and once its `` finished '' ill propose

lubuntu is very different from ubuntu

do you know how to isolate tcpdump ( or equivalent ) to a single process ?
it 's realtek . is it possibly blocked ? check with rfkill list all
not if it 's the win8 install partition
but my timezone was spain/madrid , but i had n't language-pack-es installed ( i guess it is not needed for
upstart
that old of a machine is probably not good for gaming though , as you are probably aware of .
did you start windows and then start installing ubuntu ?
or the usb is corrupt , have you tried reflashing ?
oh , ok , shall i send the output to your email address and subscribe some other list ?
sorry got distracted and forgot # fooods and things em , i do n't remember talking about discovering sailfish
yes please
again , it is the timing . ^
i confirmed it 's in the overlay ppa
were you going to merge/sync it ?
if it 's related to an ubuntu install , and possibly a config change , yes
you misspelled it
does topic need daily build link ?
then put in in /lib/firmware/brcm/
even rhel used upstart .
it does n't , except for a few dirs
well , looking in one of my earlier networking specs - part 1 , last time i checked `` rackspace

one of mine , but i dont think which exact version

staging this transition is a high priority and a legitimate use of the distro builders

i could . but it seems so pointless . does amarok not display a tray icon now or something ?
i have a feeling after your first fix it 's less visible , yes
you can try xrandr both screens on intel , but i would use the nvidia for sure

btw , the efibootmgr only edits some variables in nvram as i know .
im trying , but no idea what is wrong or how to fix it
no output
is that hard/
^
superfly : did you see the news ?
you can still the tools/agents parts of that doc to get running . -- upload-tools will get you an env
no , unfortunately it would n't be that easy
dual booting with windows , and windows installed uefi ? then ubuntu must also be installed uefi .
sorry . it 's on the laptop . i have to write it on paper and then re-type it .
and its also sort of `` donation '' to canonical right ?
is it ubuntu or xubuntu ?
heh , she does n't live in nz but seems to keep the hours ( i 'm not even sure
cool . can you take it from here ?
cheeky
did you try to purge and reinstall ?
i know they are different , but i have n't found any concrete information about version and functionality stability policy
yes , and the rest will be available on s390x eventually . so just leave it as is for me
pass .
timeshift is similar in a since to basically tar'ing the entire / filesystem while preserving perms and whatnot
it was a response to a weird series of characters that mapps wrote
small change , touches 25 files ...
i understand
going to miss you at olf this weekend
reinstall , restore the backup .
oh wait
yeah , but i 'd rather get it landed : )
between lts and non-lts
no i have not but mostly because the problem had been solved after i updated the driver
on it
i dont know pydio
so now ?
jaffa cakes wtf
if you ca n't grasp it - we ca n't help you
that will not change permissions on /media/ross/opensuse-13.2-dvd-x86_640051/home
post it here if needed , best of luck . ; )
the logic looks fine though
passing something simpler like -- desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/applications/dialer-app.desktop works
all in all , best xmas gift ever ! : )
which ubuntu release , and which de ( unity ) ?
asked already in -hardened but no answer yet
i 'm wondering if we simply make sda3 a luks device now that will cure it . as in ``
they do assume your test coverage is reasonable
well , in that case , i 'm paranoid about asking stoopid questions : - )
can you give me the link to the new patches please ?
sudo apt-get autoremove
are you using the opengl backend of kwin ?
okay i 'll have to add that later then .
that 's a weird bug , but we should definitely make sure we do n't step on each other
try this.. `` wget -o - 64.233.184.93:80/ '' ... do you see a lot of raw html/javascript ?
well , maybe for upstream some more refactoring is doable
ok , so you 've configured the cable is dvi-d ... so we 're talking about requiring all digital output
how is that going btw ?
qtbase builds fine with -debug -developer-build if you keep it in the dir where you built it , which is
going to try to get them to change it though if i can find who manages it : d
your job is to remind me to to my job asap every month
do you work for canonical ? how you guys all remember this stuff is beyond me
the random state file can be specified with export randfile= '' $ snap_app_data_path/.rnd '' - then that error goes away
or is it better if i cap the memory usage so that it get slow at times but never crashes
webdm cheats ( it has a handcrafted security policy )
irc works best if you ask specific questions
ah . right . the user wouldnt be crated at that point .
are you trolling me ?
this is the first time this happened , but i only got the phone yesterday evening
cool ty again
gmd / user switch was terribly buggy . one out of every 2-5 switches it would stall at a blank
i purified your bashrc with upstream goodness : )
ok , try rebooting
hey , again me and again regarding translations ( as i 'm assuming you have more knowledge than i do
ah - the description sounds like there 's a new design
yes , i just saw , i 'm looking at that now
i can rename it now before it lands
tried the mainservers ? do you have network restrictions ?
i thought we loicm to help , the indicator stuff wont be bad
irssi
i presume you chose the qml app with c++ plugin ( cmake ) ?
was that a joke ? i am unsure
osomon commented on them
but i 'm still thinking about possible solutions to this
awesome !
i tried `` cd /var/www/html/apps/ ; perl myscript.pl -start ; `` , but it didnt worked
it does , but i thought i fixed that
dpkg : error : unknown option -- add-architecture
dpkg -l xinit
oh one other thing would be to burn the recovery dvds with the manufacturer utility before upgrade
pm ubottu and do ! info < package >
i took a guess on your 'whay ' between 'what ' ( one letter off ) and 'why ' and
want me to do that ?
thats the default x background , looks like vnc is working fine
okay , rejecting then . let me know when there is another one to review .
so far the only thing i 've had any luck with- coming from a long history with windows
shhh that was just for management you know we only come here to party really ; )
still it will trigger once 'trigger-ci-on-stacks ' job runs again , after 15 mins : )
no worries , all good now
double-tap to do a < tab > in the terminal app
there used to be a legacy repos for older oss , but if you 're on a recent ubuntu then
o/
sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit
yes
tell the program what ?
type file /path/to/run
heh , ok
which i only mention because i had forgotten for a minute : )
events are from insights , ill check on the old one and missing event
i 'm trying to figure out what 's blocking port 3306 ( mysql ) ...
not outta the woods yet
sure , one sec
try having a look to what they did with bluez , i 'm unsure what 's the best way ,
yes . else ppa-purge has no idea how to check what packages came from that ppa .
there is obviously a built in allow rule
got ya . so a membership to a space near you for example
theres some pll configurations that you change in the bios to get higher cpu frequency
well you 're entitled to your opinion but it does n't stop it being correct : )
enable uefi and boot the usb in uefi mode
alrite finished patching the branches .
yes , you should see relation lines if there are relations in the juju status
i 've sent you a pm
no , the bulk copy was only needed for sources whose templates were missed
mongod has x
initctl start url-dispatcher
no , entries are only created by jenkins when jenkins is doing something .
hmpf , what the heck is going on here
i 'd try the setgid directory first and see how that works out
sudo kill -9 -1 6308 ( f.e ) ?
and this situation was not catched as we did not have the binding kind of test yet ...
i found a bug on gnome-terminal .
and yeah , stupid sd cards shows up as sdb on the both of hte machines i can test with
cool
did you mount all partitions needed , before ?
try the provious kernel you have showing in grub
restart , then run `` sudo service znc status '' to see if its running
ok..
ah nothing , just fund ppa : kubuntu-ppa/staging-plasma- testing 5.4.3
do you look at the changes to doccheck ? i 'm trying to add something to it every day now
but guest session works ?
perhaps a good idea
it should get in with the vpn config
i do n't think he read that just yet
that place was $ 3800/mo
i am . it 's nice and sunny !
i know clearly to apply permission using acl
wouldnt bother for a single package
gnome-terminal
sqlite doesnt allow for lists ; )
yw !
then you can sudo chmod g+w /some/directory and sudo usermod -a -g www-data youruser
sometimes i have this error but it is automatically gone after a while but this time it stays for few
you 're not using ubuntu then
it will run any version of any linux distro flawlessly
or maybe look for it using `` gqrx '' in the dash
dunno , that 's why i 'm asking . right now lxc.service has wants=lxc-net , and users are reporting races
let me top approve now and get a release in action
did you reconfigure after removing ubuntu-system-compositor ?
they have precise envs
another hack would be to depend on `` foo | aspell-doc '' or something -- i. e. alternatively depend on
yeah , phablet-shell works fine
the mount command ?
not at all : (
wich ubuntu version are you on ?
but this was not the way , i had to source the script
version number is wrong in that command
pong
the fact that the dialog does n't find it .
you could try this `` sudo sysctl -w net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6=1 ''
it worked !
okay : )
lem me see
your crazy
and in case of accidental loose i just copy that key pair to same or another system , it should
type the following
i just expected to see a folder for it in media : )
sure.. you can use that tool to do whatever scheme you want
removed or purged ?
sure , which one ?
yep , i get the memory corruption with qmlscene as well
did you search unity for windows explorer ?
that 's quite a chameleon
mint was supposed to be such a smoother version of ubuntu.. but it 's not..
glad to hear that : )
you can do what you like
might have to `` sleep '' the command..
i knowwwwww
wah , wah , hate init systems ! : - )
if said ironically , then no , definitely not the first
i will try
how did you create it ?
looks good to me .
yeah looks like a variable got renamed in one of the other branches . will change in my branch and
almost therewith update grub
hookcontext has a setstatus method , right ?
did you see ejay 's conversation yesterday about the multiple screen issues ?
genius : )
ohh , so zsync is centralized to a single server and torrent is decentralized to seeds and peers , torrents
did you fresh install 15.04 or upgrade to it ?
damn
totally up to you guys , though . if core is a settled thing and you 're happier with the
netbeans nasb dari ?
well , if you build the install from that sourcecode , you should have build deinstall script too
lgtm
have you tried the fn f8 ?
what os are installed ?
yes
ok so , what other purposes does the system you are using as your mailserver serve ?
let me reboot , by the way - time to get some sleep
i used lilo on windows to make usb and it worked
wait , why ?
oddly enough , just reading that .
sure !
are you sure the .url-dispatcher file is correct ?
can you show me the output of the command `` uname -a '' please
sure , yw ! : )
i change nicks because i do n't have a registered one and i am using webchat and ca n't always
it 's taking everything from vivid+o forward
si
it 's the only way i 'll learn
locally you can use apt-rdepends with `` -r '' to do reverse
unpack the deb and pull out the vmlinux file
can we have to version ? or should i make it like golden or something ?
ah , ok
do we have to build the unit-click-scope in a diff silo ?
have you found your hardware keyboard ? ( it should be one of the slave keyboards )
the auth.log is for the sysadmin to look at , not me : )
done , but a few comment sorry . i have to run away to soccer for a bit but will
that said , if any openstack stuff is on isos , it 'll have to wait until after tomorrow anyway
as the link i gave you explains
yeah there 's a bug in one of the perl modules
no
yes i can read . i 'm asking what os these actions are being taken under .
just the gui login is what i mean .
lxc does seem to support zfs indeed
on that machine , might see about changing the graphic 's driver . on the one present with ontel .
np . did the same thing myself last week : )
oh cool : - ) will that be automatically added to flickable 's ?
also , please pastbin instead of spamming .
lightdm is the default login manager for ubuntu
which go systemd binding are you referring to ?
it 's trivial to fix and we should do it for the mvp by all means , as changing the
have you done this setup ?
in many cases clean install can fix things , did you try the open source driver ?
it 's just one process , does n't matter how many files you server at once .
nc is netcat ; it 's like telnet , but does n't try to interpret the data the same way
no let 's get one thing straight , you are the reason your system is hosed .
and bqreaders - that 's where it 's announced
do we have any other means of fixing the bug in the meantime ?
not figured what ?
yes . i need firefox and other things .
it 's already a very exceptional corner case to specify a free_func argument ( or two pieces of user_data )
i hope you will find your way .
great
so do you assign applications to packagers to take care of
yes . but that 's already on the chopping block .
cry
what is de ?
just a mistake , it 's fine
you can remove the keys individually and clean them
it does do it right , it just there is no agps that is not something we can do anything
and every piece of information you can access *without* a mechanism for seeing when it 's changed is , basically
do you have links ?
i 'd choose the 14.04 i386 server iso
bad downloads happen . : to verify your ubuntu iso image ( or other files for which an md5 checksum
should i make this a merge against python-apt , or just include the diff in the bug and let somebody
*confetti*
i feel the urgency
is it being repaired now ? -
hey , i 'm working on the ubucon schedule for orlando , can you do an hour talk at 10am
but hey , if you do it by tomorrow it 's a full 30 days out of the way !
: )
anything install not in the releases repo set is not supported either , are you getting the picture ?
talking more the `` sudo apt-get '' thing .
but why are you telling me ?
what was the issue ?
aw , neat
i suspect it is firmware issue
oh : d then it 's a known bug
then it 's good for a respin , i have no news on the `` screen not blanking '' issue
most youtube video 's support html5 already so you wont be needing adobe flash much anymore
^
ah , maybe i 'm not getting my results because i 'm not collecting them : )
ok i have a fix in trunk , just waiting on is to roll that out then i can publish
i suggest you use unetbooting
i thought this work was , literally , you can now do that
i do n't care : )
sometimes it is so hard to tell you just have to try both entries `` )
also , check out `` aptitude ''
hopefully , if not we 'll soon find out
trie harder then : ) it has nothing to do with ubuntu : )
sudo apt-get install hexchat & & sudo apt-get purge xchat
ok , is there a bug for this ?
with your limited knowledge its easier to make a new install of ubuntu 14.04 .
but i do n't even know which node is supposed to run rabbitmq ... i 'm used to single node
you just said you did all of what elfy mentioned
see for yourself . open a terminal and run the following comand :
depends on the context , launchpad.net/ubuntu has all the packages which is the source code
i already read that : p
it appears that you are in ~/install/ ... ..
trying to resolve something blocking a demo tomorrow
sudo resets your path . try sudo -e
i will not be able to become green on kci until all traces of it are gone upstream
maybe apt clean then ?
when will we meet there ?
top-approved
i 'm heading to bed , please do post findings on that bug , since it technically appears to be
currently dual silos are configured so that everything goes into the overlay .
you could disable automatic screen locking ( light locker settings )
should i use sudo apt-get remove appname before purge ?
you mean the cyanogen one ?
yeah those are all consequences
ah ... that 's a differnece there ... regular ( libnotify ) vs push notifications
better ask in # # networking or such channel , it is not an ubuntu issue .
thx , trying elopio 's serve_daemon_test now
no , the keys live on a remote server
silly but try this . drop the last character and try it .
installing b43
that is not at all what that statement means
that was what i expected , normally fat32 mounts fine
that is the bug i 'm working on currently
do you have a link to the existing report ?
you can start udb with -disable-timeout o that it does not diw
i 'm assuming you 're using the intel for audio out ?
yep , all went well
do you remember the gvfs + samba + acl issue we discussed some time ago ? bug # 1464645
so , the .config file , and the relevant parts of .postinst and .prerm . you really ca n't miss
actually we have a voice recording api with qtmultimedia , the implementation is a bit buggy but the api is
yeah
frankly no idea why you see that . want me to test and build you a click ?
did n't
do you have qtbase > = 5.4.0+dfsg-6 ?
yw !
they are not packagers , they are developers
ok ; good to know
ah , and there 's one more thing to annotate about that card . since we are in developer mode
i already told you how i would do that ... what you can also do is extend the logical volume
sure , i 'll just finish this current review
but i reviewed the packages last night .
it would wrok if the image is all there and is bootable .
and hacked up build on all arches copied to wily-proposed .
same issue with the ppa most recent kernel
just start steam after that
happy2help !
it works
so then ?
i read about issues back in 2008 . why would n't they be fixed ?
it is encryption > lv > rootfs
no .
right , sounds sensible
i run on an internal intel gpu , pretty sure cs runs on every toaster lol
you approving the 2 parents ?
ok mate no sweat : p
it 's not that one
do we have migrations to fix ?
not unexplained
sddm + nvidia-prime + propriety driver = black screen after plymouth ( sddm does not start )
oh , i setup so that it 's rsa auth only .
shush you
what does it report in the log ?
actually nodejs is server-side javascript .
enjoy
open the dash ( the ubuntu-symbol icon on the top of the left icon tray ) and type in ``
well , you could still express intent : )
yes , i did
did .
is there a good link of where to look for the commits ? i 'm a little confused by the
i also did dist-upgrade . no luck .
oh there we go ... a nick appeared ; - )
i 'm logged out of your instance .
yes
thx
nevermind , there 's no option to blacklist anything in dconf-editor
which i did yesterday on krillin 128 and looked good
i have ppas from trusted sources . omgubuntu , webup8 and icon providers
it is being run , if it was mapped , the unmapping always runs
well , mir 0.17 landed
mh , it should be in ubuntu-session or something like that
torsten franz did nominate yesterday ; - )
does it work for you ?
well manually configure an ip address on it which is outside of your routers ' dhcp address range then
it 's not spamming . just donation .
no doubt , but it is odd that ubuntu does n't upgrade cleanly
why type ? the type is docker or systemd or rocket . the args are for whatever cli command you
that 's fine..i am stil going to go ahead with a new clock app release since this crash exists in
try 'mplayer -vo x11 blah.mp4 '
right , it 's just a minor cosmetic fix . maybe it 's not worth to update packages from a
it 's not just that . you have 3 files , where i have one
i assume method 1 is what i , m looking for ?
minecraft.jar
openelec makes that very easy and awesome .
oh right
check what `` apt-get -f install '' reports , that usually explains whats needed
read more . there are 2 versions of vbox .
i 'm not saying we ca n't change this , just that there is a subtle difference
k ... . : d
reboot ?
yeah , my friend got a 90 usd round trip from oakland to chicago last month .
idk how well its gon na work with kde or why you would use compiz instead of kwin
maybe saturday afternoon/night sometime ?
what are you doing to trigger that error , what command line is that ... in fact could you pastebin
you 're pointing it to a local file
as 15.10 is still in beta , there should be a beta reporting on the launchpad
reviewed/approved
that is not to say that it can not be messed up , or that you can not accidently loose
the helpers need the test peers . is that easy to do ?
cause the ubuntu entry we added a minute ago is now gone
yeah , that will be a part of what we are working on
.button is a class . `` panelapplet '' is a widget name
you can still have bad ram , os 's uses ram in different ways
testing it now
and ubuntu version you trying to install ?
yes , we have no unit files for any indicators : - )
is there a wired nic , an ethernet adapter on the device you are working on ?
mh , could be that the fact that alt is used by the hud might cause trobules to that ?
a. ) make sure it 's using the same login manager as it was before b. ) if it is
only snappy ubuntu core is supported
cheers
i would personally get the live iso for main ubuntu , and join # ubuntu , since that is the
it still exists afaik , so ca n't hurt
su probably wo n't work as ubuntu ( by default ) does n't set a root password
i am concerned that btrfs fucked my data up
subscribe yourself to kde release-team mailing list

mate is the fork of the old gnome 2
i am running it from terminal , it gives segmentation fault . ( core dump )
why the rush ?
clock suffers the same weird slide in affect at startup right ?
it 's a webserver
done !
yeah , do n't tell me though , i 'm ex-release-team : )
sent a big wall of text . lunch time
and then in the file manager gui you should see it on the left hand side
what he have done ? ? ?
sure
paranoia ftw : )
then it should be stored in ~/.kde/share/config as far as i know .
it will keep restarting it
then all the number ones should be - units.gu ( 2 ) not 1
i confirmed this with the ofono provisioned context , though
no , a flatpanel
you guys do n't have it easy when it comes to network services though .
check ~/.cache/upstart/dbus.log also
why it is not so named ?
if a bug bothers you very much , you are free to take action yourself as well and fix it
so i added that as a named attribute
type sudo chroot /mnt
dont you say anything bad about dobey , dobey is always helpful and pays in scotch
ok , but i have n't seen any upgrades
woot !
sorry but you are demotivating me to help you with your not-specific answers : /

so should i edit my readme for the sandbox tests or not ?
make sure to pause integration before you start pushing release changelogs
do you own apple hardware ?
type alsamixer in the console
right i understand the issue . no way to know if it 's autopilot or adt without looking . how

oops , ignore the text - that 's the command : )
question regarding frozen ppa & manual uploads , does this mean as things get propogated over ... .will it still
i just asked 2 minutes ago : )
well , i still need a working binary first
what would i do ? test the hardware with a supported os.. either , windows , if thats available ,
thx for the help . im really helpless in this problem ... .
i was just trying to install silo 4 ( inline music playback ) on a freshly flashed krillin

what gui ?
exactly
i can reboot and get those outputs before issuing any shutdown or reboot .

the root user is still unlocked
it 's not supported as it 's a microsoft file system that someone has tried to reverse engineer

you may have to contact them first

you generally get 5s after sigterm
pr is up with changes , travis ci passes
one mandatory step towards that is actually keeping your server up to date , which you 're not currently doing
no unfortunately . i got a freedos machine . installed windows on ssd ( 128gb ) then installed ubuntu on

what sort of hardware are you building on ?
preview works
should i add that file ?
yeah , so then your issues are your own : )
no , not tried , just impressed you stumbled upon that `` fix ''
it crosses my mind that perhaps some new logic might be needed for systemd services ...
i must have pressed that by accident
bug 953875
pci/ltd bios options all on default
the answer is : it depends .
i was just confused and thought , if we drop a patch we should probably mention it
just a straw of bandwidth right now , and i spent the morning on g++ again , sorry
use systemd go bindings ; do n't work to systemctl ; use correct location for units .
that is failing because you do n't have the manual pages for the cloud tools in your upstream repo
so that took a while for me.. using a cert

if you ca n't work out how to add the ppa - then you should really consider not using it

let 's boot up : ' linux ( hd0 , msdos1 ) /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 ro ; initrd ( hd0 ,
it worked last time i checked , does it work if you do it from the scope instead of the
oh right ! i forgot you could inline a package . maybe that 's good enough
if you run : sudo lshw -c network what wireless chip do you see ?
no
how did you paste that whole huge amount of lines to this channel
how do i remove a ppa from a dbuilder environment ?

centos is offtopic here . go to centos for support
i 'm sure i *didn't* . i do n't think my bios supports it
yes , sorry , i 'm a slow typer
seriously , i can just click on my ntfs drive from live cd and it just opens up . i
so just apt-get install tightvncserver ?
yes .
because if you ask any designer , they 'll tell five things do not go nicely in columns : p
it gets placed in the wrong area though
does /var/log/kern.log give any clues ?
where ?
breaking stuff is the best way to learn .
-^ first successful end-to-end : -d
daftykins ^^ is it time to look at the xorg.conf file ?
that could help yes
gdbus is doing unnecessary stuff , which is what this bug is aobut
those look good
its unusual , just pass the help to the next person who needs it : ) if you wan na
i say , experiement with settings in the live iso , and/or the guest account . then you dont have
do we have a way of translating that to the current app id we use in unity , dbus ,
so options available to us ? disable hidpi ?
so lets walk this through
would also be surprized that snappy install would run confined
make an alias ?
works for me too , i was waiting for charles to confirm that it 's ready to land
when did the problem start ?
find -type f /path/to/source | while read i ; do basename `` $ i '' ; done > ~/sourcefiles
ok , go to the node details page , and on the top , there 's a button that says
i 'm always testing in gedit in another window . the dummy i do is just setting either to a
anyway the commit is an hypothesis
have n't had any
top tells me thah
no , my laptop just has win
mirroring the bios boot partition will enable you to boot with one drive missing .
what file system is on the external disk
totally , will go to them to find out
have you upgraded before ?
i 'm trying to find that out right now ...
what is myth ? : )
sorry , my english is too bad . i locked the session .
do you have a log for the failing nova build ? seems to build ok locally for me .
i would assume so .
oh , there was a bug in charm-tools that it did n't include the cli tools
i 'm using pl_pl.utf-8
all my advice comes with a disclaimer lol , i have a vague idea of what i 'm doing ...
so i guess we need a unity8 entry in there , since there 's changes needed from our side too
im serious , thats the philosophy
that go_to_sim_lock you mentioned , right ?
have you installed it onto kvm ?
anything from `` lsmod | grep 80211 ''
so you can use adb now
how dod you install 15.04 ?
meh , ok
in my experience they tend to grow quite organically
mint 17.2 and 14.04 have the same package base
compare teamspeak with skype cpu load . if it 's about the same , the issue is bad programming .
i need more than that
you should really learn to read
landing
i told you to check the conifg
how do you not , the freaking server was unable to resolve dns , and then became completely unresponsible when
that is probably why devuan exists now . those redhat guys pushed everyone else out
please file some bugs . i 'd love to streamline these pain points after i 'm done with bileto
the same machine that have problems with ip is running as an isc-dhcp server aswell but that should't matter
hm how raw ?
i 've had problems sending when network connection was finicky too
i would go to windows with the drives , and see that they are not broken.. double check them.. maybe
forgive mf but i do n't quite get what the issue is ? you 're saying that the remote server
very well , but the transfer indicator should show that a download is being done , right ?
ok , will do that this afternoon
i never worked on a click though , what 's the workflow to merge and get it updated ?
i 've done this in the past successfully using maas tagging , and passing that as a constraint . juju
that 's not great news to hear , but it is honest . obviously that 's not something that can
yeah , the file is n't there by default , it checks if it exists , if not it uses
yeah , i am using it at work . i wanted to dig deeper on my own time .
an email is ok . i 'll look at it tomorrow morning and will act based on that and keep
support here , chat in # ubuntu+1
do you put the internet directly to the wifi router ?
read teh section : d
right , then let 's forget the nfs stuff : how do i set up a static ip *without* breaking
hey blues !
oh , but find_first_available returns 38..
good night !
yes , but which release ( version ) ?
what release are you runing ?
anyways if you come up with an app idea , we should tackle it together , and push it out
try typing in the url bar : ' about : flags ' and enable 'reset to defaults '
is that the name of your account on your installed ubuntu ? ?
which value should i look for ?
indeed
i 'm not really qualified to help . i can only speak from my limited experience , but i 'd

in a pastebin . and also if you could give the output of `` cat /etc/apt/sources.list '' as well as
service restart failing , reboot happening , or both happening at the wrong time
cd to the dir , and type ./install.sh
there are more of them : p
any specific name ?
yes , i have been doing that quite a bit . also noted that i could not do simply ``
what port , that 's the bit that worries me
in the settings
yeah , vnc is the way to go there
reboot , and as soon as your bios screen clears , depress and hold the right shift key - >
also check to see what the default shell is for that user . it seems the user is able to
when i try to forward port 80 from local ip in the local lan ( 10.42.0.0 ) to the wan
typically you can read the man page for that - ex : man grep
y'know , looking at the code , i 'm no longer convinced that it does
i know
sudo apt-get install -- reinstall unity
gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
okey i will try find something
does n't work is the most useless phrase in the english language . what did you do ? what was
run dch and add a new changelog
oh hang on , thread 9 is weird
is it possible for tracker to mine the entire home directory ? i 'm sure it does , but the
kubuntu 15.04
what i 'd do in that situation is boot with a known good kernel , copy the 'dmesg ' to
atleast on gnome
up to 5 min on desktop
check /var/log/syslog maybe
not having proper long user names is n't the end of the world , yeah
i 'll add it in my branch
can you recommend a place where i might find a super-guru who might be able to answer my question ?
so i added fourdollars efi/boot/bootx64.efi and now .3 is working as expected
it 's pretty puzzling..
if this is off topic , what is on topic ? and why is everyone glady answering me ? and
so , for sanity , i 'd suggest to 1 ) deploy the gui 2 ) apply the juju-gui-debug=true option
ah cool
ok , that makes sense . just the name was vague , and introspection i consider to inspect inside something
bq say the buttons are there
there you go ; )
something like that , but longer with desktop showoff
i thought ubuntu-touch is foe tablets
no , you would not get a windows vps : )
connect , i hope , not detroit . the latter could get awakward .
yeah , i get that same message even for vim
-f
that 's zsyncing wily daily
it began to upgrade straight on , without even asking : )
istouchapp was added for applicationinfointerface
nops
my knowledge is not great . what might i know ? ? ? : )
i ca n't even see wireless on that list - if it 's usb try lsusb
yes , but i 'm afraid it will reinstall the 3.2
yep
updates can land the minute the freeze lifts
it 's configured in system settings - > multimedia
if you 're using xterm , try rxvt or gnome-terminal
hehe ... they do n't really call it a `` start button '' but yeah that 's the one .
use netcat . : p i assume it should return me a link
not at all . if 8812au does n't work unload it and reload ath9k
the issue generally is caused because the gpu and driver are n't fully compatible ; with 'nomodeset ' the problem
i 'll retry ubuntu-touch-meta and look at the others
no , forget ubuntu 6 its old and unsecure
not using ntfs on the backup drive .
ah , sorry ( :
here 's one way to clean up some space : sudo apt-get autoremove & & sudo apt-get clean
this is the kind of instability one expects if ysing -proposed , which you are not , so thats very
client windows inside shell
good morning !
well current showed the date of the iso :
ok run the above commands and paste the links here please
or sudo service postgresql status , maybe
on it
did you disable fastboot and secureboot ?
you saw the credentials one in our fix - it 's a one liner
haha , do n't worry , i do n't bit !
yes
what resolution is your monitor ?
systemd has a conference in berlin in november
yes , i 'll wait .
so that issue is solved already .
yes
set gtk_debug=interactive to always open the inspector
fun
well , in the log - as part of the machine addresses
sorry , i could n't understand your examples of encryption , decryption : (
yeah , drop the loop line though ( got that from casper )
good , then i understand the entire command .
right now you 'll require a phone with an exception for the app from the life cycle management
ok , so how to tell the program ?
ok , well now we 've proved it will work and we were using the boot-time scripts called manually ,
ok , try to dist-upgrade
i like forcing the issue
1 hd 1 ssd that i put on cd/dvd place
check out motion
so contact the vendor would be an easy starting point
a mulitcolumnlist view ? ... for the tablet ui or something ?
try op= '' post '' ?
no , read the output of `` lshw -c network '' those are the names of the other two broadcom
do you know how to reproduce this or should i ask for more info ?
i assume you did . the trouble is , we do n't see any modifications . did you make the
that would be great if you could . is there a project i can add to the bug to better
dude watch out ! do n't go to close to lyon ; )
if we 're doing away with it
obviously everything has to decide whether it talks to systemd or cgmanager for shuffling stuff around , but the use
more explicitly , do this : `sudo touch /etc/apt/preferences.d/no-ppa & & sudo nano /etc/apt/preferences.d/no-ppa` then copy/paste into the editor ,
i would feel comfortable if elopio could give it a quick shot
hum , maybe not , do you know cases where that panel is in focus and should n't be discoverable
nah vivid is for real
how are you trying to open it ?
now the fun part : figuring out what is causing that panic .
its vulnerable right now , and is not going to get any better . upgrade
give me a sec
that 's got to be frustrating !
we 'd have to check with a `` proper '' go 1.4 first
superb
i was following the grouping i was already using ( see conn_raw.go )
the add-unit to my charm worked before i add the relation , but not after , so i 'm trying
was just trying to run on desktop
have a good weekend !
but i mean that being in *a* space means you are actually in 2 ( the juju meta space and
so yeah , do a full trigger for now
your sentence lacks a verb
i ca n't see anything in /media/video from the client
you could probably open stuff using something like `` display=:1 google-chrome ''
so i just want the autopkgtests running against gnome3-staging ppa , to warn of test failures , because right now
i only used a vr headset once and i got really confused about not seeing my hands
i used sudo scratch-text-editor /etc/sysctl.conf
i am preparing an upload for wily as we speak
i 'm looking for the dns server used by dnsmasq
but , looks like splitting out is the way of the future ... see cinder ?
becaue it logs all that
what ?
check irclogs.ubuntu.com in an hour ; - )
yeah , that 's kind of weird . i do have access to dockerhub as well , do you from
teams of ?
o i see
you 're entitled to be ranty : - ) dyslexia-descrimination is actually one form of descrimination that is n't widely
as k1l_ has stated , docking stations are some of the lesser used and owned pieces of hardware . unless
it is another one today .
yeah , same . stupid metal !
yeah 14.04
is that uploaded or pending ffe ?
do you have that truckload of asterisk fail2ban rules ?
does n't matter
can you boot thru the first menu ( tey/install.etc ) ?
yes , hence the convincing part
ack , will pull and see
stop cussing
launchpad will never accept binary package uploads
cairo-dock .
the short term cheap solution is the profile change
can you please pastebin the entire output ?
you never mentioned there being a 192.168 subnet too 0o
as in : `` cndrvcups-common_3.30-1_amd64.deb cndrvcups-ufr2lt-us_1.20-1_amd64.deb ''
sorry -- what you tink is ppa -- do i understand it wrong ?
i was curious , i doubt i can add more than bashing-om . i see a mixture of outliers that
lol he took many minutes to even say which os he was in before : (
you should , in onopenscope , check if you have a scope open and close it before doing anything else
from a linux distro ? to mount the .iso ?
fixed
is the teamspeak server really not running ? i sometimes get that warning too , but the server starts up
15.04 : echo 'config : { ubuntu-core : { autopilot : off } } ' | sudo snappy config ubuntu-core
you can run tests and display smart data with smartctl
in the morning : )
so i cant use a different program at all
there are plans to allow access via content-hub
see if you can install another 512 meg ram in that box too ; - )
so scp , rsync ...
oh it 's a gnome taskbar system monitor applet
but yes
afaik the only benefit of pesign over sbsigntool is nss , which is a questionable benefit
the canonical one i was given
so please do n't make me look like a rude man here
ok , that was vague earlier ; )
7am is n't your usual start time : )
going for a quick lunch first though

it appears that your firewire drive was literally f*cking your computer : p
i was too lazy when i set the server up
the best way to answer a french person is slapping them with a baguette and then the ! fr trigger
did you install gksu ?
try to paste dmesg | tail and cat /var/log/syslog
ah , seems like a necessary evil of sorts
just pull to refresh the app scope and u should see it
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf
what does the pop-up window look like ?
wxl waht can i do
yeah no unload
reason im asking this is nagios 3 is rather out dated im aware that i should probably file an upstream
this is occurring since the target branch for vivid builds have been marked as lp : indicator-keyboard/15.04
weird , maybe it died ?
take a look at the review above
i mean he said it would be a different topic to add : d
it can be bug maybe , but it will not make anything bad : )
but that means 12.10 - > 13.04 - > 13.10 - > 14.04 so that is gon na take some
that sounds familiar from the ci unit test runs but i 'm running locally now on trusty to check
i dunno . i 'm actually not even sure if it 'll work
that 'd be good
hmm well i still see it in api/
you are making it to easy than it actually is .
network card chipset + driver plz ?
all ubuntu support , but there is n't any guarantee that someone knows about your issue
i could n't reproduce this on every try , but it happened more or less 6 out of 10 times
xubuntu-artwork uploaded
ah yeah , i 've used that for lan testing
yes , how did it go ?
so something that truly does depend on libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-vivid hase n't properly declared it as such ... and after that 's
were you able to work around it ?
use just the text editor ( html ) for now
nah that 's it , it does n't think that build-depends line is long enough to wrap
yeah , just verified that it 's gone from 1024 to 65536 between uoptic and vivid .
then you just add another space and it becomes a sub-item
whats up with your python env ? ; )
great , i love developing and testing : )
using 'wget ' i see `` error : no certificate subject alternative name matches ''
and then i gradually moved everything over so that the executor was the only thing with responsibility for writing state
wait there is a new kernel and a new debian-installer has just been uploaded
name needs a setter , at least .
the rsyslog files were in the log dir , and natefinch moved them recently to the datadir
can you try login in gui mode , press ctrl-alt-t to start a terminal and then run `` dconf reset
alright that 's an entry in the environments.yaml right ?
see devel list
no ... but i can do it
if you consider a test failure to be a positive , that is
you mean like windows ?
rerun as in fsck /dev/sda1 or the command you pasted ?
just like here
he had cancer , but he was expected to last longer
yes . and do note systemd is not supported on 14.04 lts , the first lts with systemd support will
if by that you mean fully seperating things ? yeah - i 've been known to do that . i
yes
you 're actually two steps behind
it looks like i have the exact same files on this laptop as on snappy

you should either release to wily and sync back to vivid , or use dual-landings or create a separate trunk
^
it may be that a firewall change or similar is now preventing the jenkins builder from reaching cloud-images.u.c
you mean leaves and joins from channel ?
no idea when or what though
a , you would check , if a connection between a node and state exists ? not the data in
yw !
i 'm not in vivid currently
or have a status property and exposed bool
i wonder if we have an indavertent issue here though . from my brief look systemd is just passing on
understood
but how can i enter the terminal in the blank purple screen ? sorry for such a stupid question
works for me
clean install , it was working before
ethernet controller is network card under lscpi ?
i might experiment with setting up a build environment with lxd as well
there are two cases - waiting to happen and waiting not to happen
type mount and check the output
have you been manually doing any apt stuff in the chroot ?
i live in za .
i 'm talking about 14.10 on this old desktop
i had used the the display applet in settings to use the full screen resolution of the notebook , then
64 vs 32bit ?
the problem is your login into the mysql db : )
pm ?
yes , check that
with the same error messages ?
yeah..
there is already lugs on meetup , so linux-related stuff happens
well if machine keeps locking up , what could it hurt ?
have you tried sudo apt-get -f install ?
ok , run `` dpkg -l|grep nvidia|awk ' { print $ 2 } '|xargs sudo apt-get -y purge '' *
yeah , tried in leafpad and gedit , it does n't a text editor issue
though , i get the `` if the clock is totally busted , oauth will explode '' issue . but
from my experience `` american english ( united states ) [ gb ] '' mean english uk
would n't that be better as just a single string arg ?
moral of the story , do n't migrate to distro 's based on ubuntu ; p
`` lost control '' what are you talking about
my android phone advertize itself as a phone
sounds like a reasonable plan
yes , but i linked the two you filed earlier : )
it appears my cronjob was not running . so i 'm fixin gthat now
dunno could be
and i bet it comes with a setup.py
a few tweaks
and /tmp/cov.out is empty
did you checksum the iso ?
is this site in django as well ?
seems to work , i am working on unity side
yes , unless we join them ...
looking
thx
just wondering who still uses irc cli based
when do you merge dpkg ?
i did . didnt work
you can use groups username , to see what groups a user is in , if you need more granular
oh , does it ? til .
officially this channel can only support software that is in the repo , since it has been vetted and tested
cheers
we spun an image after the most reent ppa upload
so we can just store that , and it 's not provider specific
oh , eh , yeah . too quickly scrolled to the bottom
ok , good to know . for now i guess i 'll just add `` adwaita , gnome , hicolor
ah yah definitely switch then : )
correct : )
afaik systemd support has landed and for vivid we no longer have an exception to run it with upstart
that sounds really like fastboot block mate
what about it ? that is not a full question .
already asked there , no answers in 3 hours
because he got the command wrong . it 's nm-connection-editor
what is that branch anyway ?
revision 3 just pushed to bzr - ingest incoming
the ubuntu install cd ? it 's dvd-sized now
you did things to your system , not windows .
why do you need images to compare channels ? manifests should be enough
ioria what do i do now ?
we can verify while adding that there 's no existing space with the given non-empty provider id
: - (
see `` /usr/share/initramfs-tools/init '' which is the /init script
or # kubuntu , if it really affects kde users particularly .
the only instability i have experienced is when i had a large number of task manager items in the panel
i just don not see the point of exporting suite
already did that , still i see only entry with ( hd0 , *partition )
not yet , sorry
yeah , i meant to ask about that .
it is
sysvinit scripts ?
are you at work ?
ok , on it .
ah !
fixed
a bunch of errors in response
you can write programs that are os agnostic to a point but most are n't ... java , javascript ,
no , but this week or next i guess
so i should n't woorry with an up to date kernel and iptables ?
well it seems to be working
well , i 've forgotten a bit , but the last point i tried to improve base on your last
primary
all good now
e.g . systemd-network
thats why i am using gnome 3 until papyros-shell is ready : )
have you been cursed by this bug as well ?
got ta love second hand hardware
i will reassign it . can you attach a screenshot ? that url does not work.. ! ?
it 's not the best approach to learning - simple as that
i know i had way more kernels than the ones i showed you
+1
you wo n't be able to do chmod on ntfs afaik
i do n't believe it was ubuntu server . i 'm pretty sure it was the first one nymeriafr linked
ah , not having much luck
ok , what graphics hardware ?
looking for a needle in a haystack ... for some reason your system will not get an ipv4
i dont see anything about storage stuff ; mjust that cpu tspeed got throttled due to heat
i may have written it but now i am a customer ; )
is edge getting built from trunk ?
not entirely sure , possibly inlining ?
wow . o.o
true and i agree , it sounds like a bug . it will definitely prove it 's a bug if
look up a web store in the us ; )
but 14.04 is lts , its the perfect choice for a server

yes , that 's normal
assuming they do n't exist yet in ubuntu
last email i have on this joe just says keep him posted
but i do apprecite your time and support !
i believe zfs is supported better on other distros .
can i have a kubuntu email now ? : d
i was just trying the 0.12 branch
you cant provide facts . that is what 5 people were asking you to all the time . and all
ok
i 'll add that to the list ... .lol
if it 's another question , what 's up ?
i have n't noticed something like this locally , but i have n't tried mm recently . does the blocking
i guess to have either , not a mix of them . now it first compiles something on vivid and
but please tell us what you did , we need bileto to not break on it : )
no i did n't
... no
the code , most likely not the instance
it was denied
how does this sound ?
compare with se . , fr . , de . , etc .
just as a sanity test
for now yes .
it 's nice , is n't it ?
seems the security repo is slow , others ok
accounts-console does the same thing calling glib , but in an ugly way .
what .
the inetd.conf error is coming from exim-config using dpkg-reconfigure
yes .
you got a technical ubuntu issue ?

turns golf into polo
1. tell us how you did
and when you installed .2 , you did n't wipe the efi partition . but when you installed .3 ,
for curated components or community components ?
ok , type groups
that 's fine
to answer your specific questions as asked , launchpad will never forget about that orig in that ppa ( though
i do n't trust your sketchy pastes .
roger
daniel put some gold tape on it and kay some stickers of a cat ... so ... yes ? !
better ask what you need mate
all the manual installs appeared to fail , so that seems correct
you recite many wise things , but none of them are yours ; )
for example
otherwise the first onvisibleheightchanged has un-initialized value , no ?
still feeling a bit uneasy about that , but i guess if there 's a use case for controlling these

we would n't have this if we would not use the qtorganizer stuff ...

this made no difference , audit now only shows the net_admin deny

check you have `` qtdeclarative5-qtorganizer-plugin '' and `` qtorganizer5-eds '' packages installed
i tend to use mainline kernels so i 'd probably suffer more if amd are behind the curve somewhat
oh , right
there
the /home/ < user > /.bash_history file should keep all of your commands
welcome , this is an ubuntu support channel
seriously , do you read what others say ? you are the thrid now to say the same thing ,
maybe you should format your usb stick before making the bootable
i once ran build with watch_only quite quickly after uploading the final version , now it 's like that..
testing and bugs could be subsections for the qa section
`` anon @ pc ~ $ genfcsm genfcsm : command not found ''
how does that look to you now ?
what 's the error you get back ,
kde is coming highly recommended so will give it a shot
well that particular package does n't appear to be in his repo list , but it does list it on
i did n't propagate that change into unstable , which is where i 'll likely start from for x
my apt-cache policy python-jenkins says i have 0.2.1-0ubuntu1
read the comments in notesstore.cpp
just type , cat /path/to/file/here.desktop
that 's the result when i run juju status juju-gui | grep address : 'public-address : node0vm0.maas ' , but
sudo add-apt-repository ppa : webupd8/team/java
it 's anonymous , and it 's already working as root..
did you try the command ? : `` sudo apt-add-repository multiverse & & sudo apt-get update ''
do n't worry - got it
i thought the default battery icon has some stats for that
are you going to run the above commands ?
collection of githubs = not official ubuntu repos
it is a very confusing to me . running different command gets different results : )
ahh , some kind of backport
no , that is not how you learn
in the installer , when you choose something else , when it asks where it install , you can partition
sorry , i 'm an idiot
well , for this case i can put up with whatever makes sense to stderr
loop mounted images per app ; )
you 're ( near ) the top of the list though : )
i have set mode +r now . i forgot to do so initially .
moron , i just entered the channel
type this from terminal to see all your services list : sudo sed -i `` s/nodisplay=true/nodisplay=false/g '' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop
we have plugins already that base out of python3
i doubt that
yea i know , we do n't have many of them
what 's the issue now ?
< ohsix > there 's the systemd-analyze man page : p
yeah that 's what i have
it 's a software raid , which means that you can use the ubuntu partitions without a raid there
have you added ppas ?
10.04 is out of support since years for the desktop . so there is no way you can stay with
ubuntu-server 14.04
look at `` /var/log/xorg.0.log.old '' for clues - that *should* be the log created when the x server tried to
normally you can switch sound from internal speakers to hdmi output , in your sound options
once you share some details yep
i used the go one in the syscall package
sneaky
yup you got it ! ! !
we have single trunk for both wily and vivid
ok so the oly difference is the user interface ?
i 've read many online posts mentioning xorg.config , but as the information does n't seem to be the same
instance brings up the same first result /me is embarrassed
how about this , *try* using the pepperflash , since , you state you have not , and you and
same as v3.18 -proposed ... ok
if you have an external hard drive , you can make an exact clone of your drive before setup ,
yep , so what are you interjecting about then , if i may ask
a no change rebuild that adds the symbols files ?
: )
again : dont put the ppas in there . add them with the command i said before
xming is also highly regarded .
what has 'executable ' got to do with anything ?
that 's not much of an answer . i put up these servers to run web applications .
what was that for ?
canonical partners are unchecked
some channels require a freenode account made , did you see any indication in the channel header ?
yeah ... the train is a bit of a stupid entity ( mostly because it was only a proof-of-concept )
component/all is the intersection point
the simple installation of the sdk is one of the fundamental requironment : (
i still saw it once out of 10 or so
ah , interesting ; do you have anything in /var/cache/pm-utils ?
what command can i use to list my graphic hardware
yeah , keeping my fingers crossed
xubuntu is between lub and ub .
k
the positive side of -3ubuntu6 is that i hope to go to +100 lines diff in the hook with debian
well just be careful man
it could be done otherwise , but for example d/changelog ( or other debian/* changes ) or tags would be
ack , will do
then give me another : grep nouveau /etc/modprobe.d/*
fold your arms and blink
or have seen , anyway
ok , boot and press e over the ubuntu entry
i 'll verify it first , then yes , will do ...
ah i ca n't ... wife is away . doh
ok mate
i wish you where gay : (
um , in the comment ?
how can i enforce the security i want on them ?
woops
hey , this one was a team effort : )
i do n't really know c/++ , so i ca n't help you
did that answer your question ? it will be updated with security fixes too hence the 11.4 bit : )
do n't blame gnu/linux for that
but that 's definitely more work in both livecd-rootfs and ubiquity .
ah , for some reason i thought maybe you were motu
usually by running raspi-config to configure ub-oot
hm , but not on a local build ?
it 's failing because of qt 5.4
hey ; and i 've approved the branch in silo 15 ; let me know when you take that one
link to irc logs please
still doing some clean up ; ) it 's not so late here , wanted to finish up some things
yea ... . i know , usually i would do it myself.. but it is formatted different than i am
no , let people apt-get install qtcreator-plugin-autopilot if they want it .
bigger drive , the os drive is smaller but ssd , data drive is hdd but 1tb so i use
maybe i should install a full vm to test sigtem
you may check by : cd /var/crash
i did that
how did you create your ubuntu usb ?
yeah but all the new things \o/
`` pastebinit < ( ls -latr $ { home } /.local/share/kscreen/ ) ''
of all the things on the 15.10 roadmap , replacing xfdesktop in ubiquity seems like one of the things we
i also used start up disk creator
if you need a reference , here 's my sudoers file . i have personally never touched it , so
indeed !
but there is no connection yet . by the way i 'm using a different computer to chat .
my manta goes into a funny loop witht he screenn flashing , and will never shut down
why .
^^
that 'll create an empty file with size 1 gib
operations can , the transaction guarantees are n't the same i believe
do you already know what `` improve ubuntuonair , get proposal '' is going to be about= ?
assuming its using upstart , check that there is n't a `` /etc/init/network-manager.override '' making it a manual start
you can install mir-demos , in which there are three demo servers . all of them understand `` -- vt
hmmm it will also remove ubuntu-desktop ... maybe not a great idea ?
: ) night nite . see ya next time .
yeah , i dunno , would be good to rule that out
it full name is /file ?
... the router `` sudo dhclient br0 & ''
but several upstream apps would then have to be patched too , if we introduce a new inhibit-mechanism
where you getting % from ?
was n't a description at all
i assume , because it 's fake anyways , and at least this way it 's consistent and you can
that 's what i thought
right , that is one of the recovery methods on that page
as i 'd like to land compiz ...
i meant
ubuntu isnt mint
yes good idea
because i tried to use 15
xd , i have like 6 different irc window opened across couple servers so i tend to get a bit
( or whatever the channel message is called )
i see , ok .
i did it again and it worked
or play around with fstab entries
like i can snapshot a state in vbox , create a clone out of it , continue destroying that vm
okay , well , then i guess you get to backport some fixes to trusty . it 's not like
welcome : p
now i 'm looking into the fact that it creates a virtual ethernet interface .
you 're old-fashioned .
yes , that 's the idea ... basically a no-op thing and then re-nice it to hog resources
/home
then just type ssh foo
what company are you with ?
but , but , but we released a few weeks ago
as lordievader mentioned , a lot of the ppl in the know are away in spain at the akademy conference
when you scroll down to the packages with info `` urb_bulk in '' , the length shows `` 61504 ''
yes , i was on holidays for a few days and had a number of things to do
ok no login loop but just my desktop and a mouse
so every script i put into '/etc/network/if-up.d/ ' will be automaticall started ?
yes , i get the same
my way of fixing this is messy and involves chroots from a liveusb . i 'm sure there 's a
look for what the actual changelog head says ... follow that one . nobrainer : )
oh ok
so the issue is that the version number of the bluez silo for ppa upload only is wrong ?
`` ping '' is the command
do it again with | pastebin then share the url
12.10 was the first release
for single use , you can teamviewer it
yes . there exist amd64 cpus without sse3 aiui .
shrug , multiple de : s work for me
so it 's because of the /sbin/dhclient apparmor profile that we ship
i did that first , so that we unblock
oh , as in , you install two curated components ? you have to import them both individually . so
yes ( libreoffice-evolution , iceweasel , and vino ) should be still fixed , as those are not in ubuntu
hmm . that 's a decision made after the image is published ?
hello !
firstly , i used the go-systemd unit to create the service file and , just as an observation , the
i disagree
this is more involved than just subnets because they depend on fabrics and vlans . fun : -|
so fglrx works now for you ?
sprinting this week , but i 'm here early
does it is unit tweak tool the same thing than ccsm ?
no one can say if your issues doesnt come from missing one of those updates .
right , i see the need , i just have no idea right now what to do
no , we just look the other way
that 's your cue : p
^
totally agree it 's not a kernel issue
ok deleted the words quiet splash and hit crtl-x
okay , well , it 's still libjsoncpp0 , i do n't see how that solved the problem . :
makes me think someone changed the port association . i would n't be surprised if you could ping istack1 's
ok , now install the pastebinit package in case it is n't already installed : `` apt-get install pastebinit ''
ok i got it , they gone , but to where ? !
have you tried that thing with the defer ?
ok , now `` sudo parted -l | pastebinit ''
hm having said that ... the -15.18 was never in the main pocket ... : -p i see -14.16 is
do you have access to the power test network in 1ss ? ( can you connect to 10.245.64.15 ? )
ca n't access mysql either for some reason .
annotations-tags ?
i have a vpn that works when i add a general accept , but not otherwise , and i am
then again , you would not get any list with proxy ..
continuous integration : we can see that azure has n't been very reliable . each red/blue do it an hour
yes
now i have a picture of a chip on the screen with a cross through it
anything that drains the battery more than expected is a bug
ok well that pushes us to release it with warts , but that is probabally ok , i 'll know
yeah , i have no routes or up interfaces left
fair enough
no i 'm just testing it now
xorg log , syslog , dmesg can show you usefull stuff
command not found
armhf ?
try sudo apt-get install linux-generic
* mvo_ is very curious
yea - that was the beta bug for a similar thing
yea , i 'm going through the list . many people tagged there stuff as beginner , which would prevent
with great pleasure : )
that it is . it is part of the reason i take the bus most of the time .
which ones ?
ok , quick question . is that my network adaptor i see , or is this the software installed for
i get this for mysql and nfs , but i ca n't seem to actually destroy the services
i agree with that but the min that the option to make someone step down it should have been taken
nothing happens
broken clock or something ?
i have not . i just tried it . no package ubuntu-release-upgrader-core . update-manager-core already on latest version after apt-get
so , get snappy running on an arm board , install lxd and start a lxc . install snapcraft there
line 101 please
in the beginning of s3test/server.go - resourceforurl ( ) and run the tests , paste the output
if those entries i mention are n't there , then your configuration settings are being ignored due to them being
on windows . i dont think it has dd , does it ? \
package-import ca n't just be upgraded to 14.04 ?
btw , just found why my pre-commit failed . only one missing line
oh , right . it 's unity
you mean ls -l on the mountpoint ?
you have fiddle with that page for sure , all the links are pointing to the right pages
whole working dir ? there 's the image in there now , too
can you help me out
a steam game with the grapics even set to lowest and also a crap ton on my pcsx2
boot to recovery and leave it for 20-ish minutes to discount hardware first maybe
excluding the general credits still , yes ?
ok
what file is that ?
you can enable performance mode in there
yep , jinja2 essentially does `` \n '' .join ( rendered_template.split ( '\n ' ) ) , and so only
indeed ! i 'm just glad the fix was simple enough . a single url will do it
so pastebin the output .
i thought you did n't
cloud trouble again , or flaky tests ?
it might be better to use the charm_dir function to fully specify it
or skip -- bare and archive , and just let it do the head checkout and run tar yourself .
not exactly when you run lsusb you should see different bus numbers for your usb ports
likewise , the push client daemon on the phone does n't pop up login windows randomly , because it 's
swap-file might work too if you dont want/have a swap partition
`` live image of kubuntu utopic with packages from git '' should say vivid not utopic
it is happening on cisco site
do you have the color mode at the highest setting ?
but it 's a direct backport of the fix we used for wily , so it should work .
have you resubmitted the proposals ?
the main issue here is that testability of a patch since the conditions necessary to reproduce the bug are difficult
ok , so my kernel gives him more memory , but what was the previous one ?
sorry , wrong url ...
but you do n't need it now . just run xrandr as a mortal user .
or sudo python3 -c from time import sleep ; a='x'*500*2**20 ; sleep ( 10000 ) ''
we asked for an admin clerk , as usual the response was no

why is the 0.1.2.9 in updates , but not in the updated ids anymore ? the only step between is

control sda5_crypt ubuntu -- vg-root ubuntu -- vg-swap_1
ok , try update-grub
dpms is the monitor display power management signalling
tried in python but i get nothing
ksyslog is still broken when called through krunner
do you know why we have postgres on that server ?
it is ?
hmm ... i 'm not so sure , you can come back in about 6h , since most developer here
it 's k. m on feature branch : d
hum alright then i may agree with you
my advice would be to get the name of the wifi card you use and search for the installation ,
ok , only need infos about the full stack feature test . i 've got them in there .
is this drive in a new system , or old ?
no worries ! : - )
it is n't drastically different from apple
also please type everything exactly as i 'm typing it
you can sort bugs by bitesize and see what is newer
its just a `` point release '' . not a new version .
you 've convinced me to bring my acer to next sprint .
i helped him set up postgres on his mac-os , he can run the thing now and is looking at

was wondering if we even wanted to kill the possibility of closing from scope
but im talking about maybe a year or 2 in the future
everything is set to uefi
if you mean the etc/default/grub file , the entries are not explicitly listed in there . how will i do
bit off an odd one - if you really need me to install ubuntu to hardware to check it 's
all been ported
once again , did n't use to be that way
double quotes instead of single , and you need a comma between the k : v pairs
i 'd prefer not to create charmrepo.v2
anyways im wondering if there is any real advantage like speed etc
sudo dhclient eth0
yep
on the phone , assuming you have telegram installed , do :
i ca n't find any error logs to correct whatever mistake is being made
any idea what/where is proper channel to submit bugs report for packages in kubuntu ci ppa ?
by the time it gets to 40 again i hope ill have managed to change computers
what is giving you lsusb command ?
they would fail at android 5 if they 've never seen or used android at all as well
thks , ill see .
man just as well i know cyphermox rocks right ; )
what i mean is that the premise is ridiculous . if you ca n't count on people with admin rights
if you know of more issues in the icon theme , now is the time ( i 'm working on
with the parameter 'text ' starting the display manager is supressed .
yea , nuclearbob is n't feeling well today , but he owes us an update on what 's happening .
would n't it just go into digikam.install ?
ah , i did n't notice , ok cool
so you are confirming that any package thats downloaded with sudo apt-download .. is a .deb package , since only
if there is no service daemon running and listening on a port , you cant `` hack '' the port
i see
gbp ? okay
i installed ubuntu version 14.04.3 as a virtualmachine in virtualbox and installing guest additions failed all the times i tried
i did uprade , but i have n't been asked for any migrations
^^ related
its an ubuntu-gnome patch , upstream would n't take it , since no one else implements the what-provides locale
so not used irl or during qmluitests , but came up under adt
vivid is being used by people to test/develop , these people might browse the web with an outdated/insecure web browser
nothing
it 's like charm alias
yeah , getting ready to get started on that shortly
how can i configure the powerdown mode used by 'shutdown ' ?
how do i get to where you want me to be ?
i understand that . we 'll provide you with some test kernels to try . if you can successfully boot
they convert analog to digital , and digital to analog
so , apiserver- > model- > persistence , and the rules in model ?
start the lighdm
why ?
it 's always several hours minimum now that we land to real archives so that we do n't skip proposed
did n't saviq come up with a solution for this `` ca n't merge new features while vivid is frozen
i 'm sorry , i 'm not much of a gui person . perhaps someone else in here knows .
what `` tut '' are you following ?
juju run `whoami & & pwd`
it 's in an lxc container so you can dump it afterwards i guess
do you have any ppa 's installed ?
good choice though
i stopped
halle : )
open a .tar.gz , select a file in it , click extract
i already kicked a watch only build
sudo chroot /mnt
gestures being different and not having a hardwrae keyboard are painful
okay , cool . just updates it is , then .
if you use ssh , i would install fail2ban also
is it a usb device ?
davidcalle , mhall119 , bregma : i 'll let you know once is moved ownership to the team
i will try sudo apt-get build-dep libopenblas-base
ok !
what about the issue of the txns.prune collection growing forever ?
no it wo n't eject . also , i notice something . it used to launch vlc automatically when i
check `` scrot -- help ''
yep
should be fine with armhf
android runs on arm processors usually , your computer is probably i686
better setup a bridge first
do you now
ok great hehe
no , i 'm not aware of that
join # ubuntu-ops and tell us about it
that 's a state server on jessie ?
one way of solving this problem is by not being in iran ( which is probably not a realistic option
i do n't think so
i 'm in dd-wrt . no one know
i am guessing so , at least it happens to me
sorry for doing it wrong ; - )
potentially it does make sense to have a redirect on code/project/branch/revision/revno perhaps ?
it is now , yes .
to be more precise , it will execute at these exact times : 6:15 , 9:15 , 12:15 , 15:15
you do n't have to wipe though.. only flash
you are wanting to make a testcase to run through checkbox ?
i 'm on the command line and i already ran that command .
the problem is , that you have waited way to long
i do n't see anything about /writable in the journal from systemd
i did n't
i moved the card back to need qa sign off
i hoped so too , i seldom have something for more than one day . so i already canceled being
yes , i found many pages like this in my initial research : - )
i can already say something positive about the gps : there is none .
.local/lib install and ldconfig ? dunno
i 'll need it in a recipe of sorts to make sure i do n't screw up
/lib ca n't be a mount in any sane posix system .
would you be able to spot-check for blatantly obvious evil errors in my pattern that i 've written locally ?
15.04 is ubuntu , polling on your computer is offtopic is all .
so far there 's no bug or work-item about it even
exactly , but sounded like he wanted to create a vm for each ( or i am not reading properly

yes , all plugged in
sometimes the time between the package lists and the hash lists being updated can be several minutes
did n't get that last sentence
can you explain the situation then ? are you having trouble booting ?
it happens .
i could try other cables , but i doubt it 's the cable
you should implement something simular for kubuntu
... ok , ignore me
the snappy part will be interesting for sure
it should be a setting inside your bios , it sounds like you have an efi bios but have legacy
auto-sync looked ok , feel free to turn it on at your leisure
in a fresh vm i see two unit= , though
ok go ahead in building 654
nope
what is the error message ?
yes
but , to be clear , you do n't want or use a requirements.txt file .
that 's not in the landing/silo ?
how 's things ?
tune2fs can do that
when did this start happening . did you reboot .
rebooting now again to see
did the charm changes look sane ?
try gksu system-config-samba
well , in the case of glibc 's postinst , init specifically , since it reexecs .
more that a query might not used a query if the field order in the query does n't match
so how can i include udisks to use xfce4 ?
funny it did n't really work for me again , constant plasmashell crashing . `` segmentation fault '' iirc
can you be more specific ?
okay now what ?
that 's probably from the input field cursor blinking
during boot when the grub menu show up . at the bottom it will show you which key has to
so can i pop something off the cloud_init_modules list in cloud.cfg.d ( or the data source ? ) , or
yes
yes , imo the better course of action .
was it not captine who also wanted to have a go ?
non-graduated second opinion : shipit :
sudo apt-get install -- reinstall gksu
what do you need it for though ?
ooh , that 's not what i heard . : ) i thought the stable channel was still synced .
that does n't help .
on livecd and on dell diagnostic runs fine
did you actually have to destroy existing towers to free up space for more powerful ones ?
ah , ok. `` no qa needed '' is not the correct one .
comes from the vcard import , translated into a model of qtcontacts .
ever work on thunar ?
but would the generator run from initrd ?
has the baby sang `` i dress up in women 's clothing , like my dear pa-pa '' yet ?

i will file other bugs from the results we got , but can address and reland easily enough next week
the first one will be updated automatically when a tarball is made with trunk at r133+
double click on it
that was the biggest part i was afraid of screwing up . as for not being able to type i
sorry but no , in the middle of the weekly desktop team meeting
hence `` bingo ''
it 's almost certainly due to them having the same subnet ( network ) *or* due to the index issue

firmware upgrade for the laptop , you mean ?
i mistakenly thought that plasma 5.5 was going to that ppa
anyhow , i 'm looking at these merges , since it should also come with a change to mac-fdisk that
and they notify by sending the appropriate entity ids in response to enter-set , change-life-to-dying , and remove-or-set-dead
im a little confused about the sda stuff , windows makes 2 partitions ( sdb1 and sdb2 right now im
dpkg -i forces even a downgrade
that 's how i understand it as well ; copying pots around would be just wrong
some of us have been using linux for multiple years and are experts .
no , i had the sound issue before i restarted
there is a ppa with backports of 5.3 to 14.04 for example ( iirc ) .

sure , ping me back

have you tried booting the older kernel ?
got my bq 4.5 yesterday : p
that looks a lot like a glibc testsuite failure that binutils 2.26 ( or , something backported from 2.26 to

i want the blue dot with the lxde mark . best is svg , or hires png ; - )
i seem to recall seeing params structs

that is still an open question ( if we 're going to offer something similar ) , but i 'd

oh , it 's a package which is n't on teh images ? which package is that ?
i also thought that launching apps in this way is mostly discouraged and requires the use of the -- desktop_file_hint
the right one is already installed . you just have to get rid of the wrong one .
it 's an irc client
auth.log
must spaces list be a bulk call ?
curses just means that instead of being line-by-line , it has a gui-like screen . you 'll see what i
it was that ^^
we can make an image tonight but i suspect we need another prior to regression tests starting
already done , the discussion is ended now : p
you could also try using sftp rather than ftp ( which can be configured in dput.cf )
i see
looks like gearhead fix i can relate .
ok , then i 'd strongly suggest you consider installing the proprietary nvidia drivers to solve the video problem .
or after the name of the package
ages .
`` the book of inkscape '' or see inkscape.org for not shortage of tutorials and support materials

so having the component in the sdk is n't going to hinder you at all . evryone is a winner
it 's funny , it did n't close the applications i had open , but it deleted everything else other
set up one account for administration with strong password . let them use the guest account .
we 'll iterate on that later
hey mate
i do n't think i know anything about your issue unfortunately : (
anyway , it looks suspicious - do you know why that test starts a goroutine there ?
pastebin us the text plz ?
even nautilus has ui support for this is you ca n't be bothered with cl
hmmm ... ok
note , however , that i actually implemented that previously and found it very annoying
i 'll check if we can divert some resources to looking at it
why not , you should beable to
this bug is reproducible on rtm and vivid .
that would work , but beware of windows
: /
sddm -- example-config will print the complete current configuration to stdout
it 's perfect ! i 'm doing the removal then : )
and we dont use the debian method on ubuntu , we use the update-manager or do-release-upgrade
haha
just save it in your home directory and then sudo cp it to the destination
katco : landing that 3 pointer now ... just waiting for the landing bot to take it .
relatively easily , yes
i knw you are short staffed , but we can only go so far with our experience
that sounds like a development question , not an os support question : ) join a programming channel .
ok .
i try to help with ut , maybe you do not see : (
no worries , that 's my job ; - )
can you check what dpkg -s unity8 says there ?
i do n't see it in the archive ... ca n't say
okay i have 1 fast question what 's the best way to install lxde on ubuntu 14.04.3 lts properly ?
why ? kernel version does n't mean much
that is because by default curitn picks the first disk
oh , i just check in from the scope , have n't tried from the webapp
latter , less wasted space imo
^
any chances that the emulator is fixed soon ? we have an event coming up and a working emulator will
good luck
ack
well , this is a cloud server so if i break it i can just blow it away and try
oh , right . this . i suppose it 's too late to revisit the `` maybe you should call
yes , any-ip will work best
vivid/15.04 .
right , it 's a ui change for those folks
i still dont think the input is that small
curl.tetor
how are things ? good friday morning here ?
i have n't been following your thread - this is to get around a firewall ?
i just wanted to show you plainbox snappyified : )
it is just the documentation bundled with the kernel source
so i 'd like to see if there is any gnome log or something
right , i thought you said you did , but my brain seems to be fried atm
no
be carefull with remote software , try ssh instead
how about ' sudo aptitude search hfsprogs ' ? does it find anything there ?
if you file a bug for it , i 'm sure design will take another look at the spec .
the second is what walinuxagent puts in place with its udev rules .
go to the console ( alt-f7 ) right after the node boots , you 'll be able to see cloud-init
so would setup-staging set the right variables to make online-accounts-service use staging or would we have to do more than
from what i see nouveau does n't fully support the ion
i 'm reading that as a `` yes '' . holler if you 're trying to politely say `` that
right , and it works well
hmm , it 's fine to ignore the message , but does n't it quite the upgrader when you close
okay what 's next
well the thing is , xorg shouldnt be edited nowadays , so with bumblebee that got wrong ...
in which case , this points to some issue with the perc boot rom
wow , ok , just discovered my gpg key expired a month ago , gon na need some time to
it could also be caused by the syscall numbers being different between 64-bit and 32-bit
yes
cool , no worries
install it , thats the key to listening to mp3 , video etc
your screen passcode will also be your password for sudo .
well , that would mean finding a person to run the job , not something i can do in the
great . so , i will find a flashdrive or a blank disk somewhere and install from there .
good morning
i am particualy looking for ubuntu which is bind to gcc v4.5.x .
will grub be correctly configured for this setup ?
yes , i corrected my typo . it 's `` up '' not `` ip ''
yeah , still waiting for mir 0.18 to release
i agree .
bien , merci !
happy to see it got smoketested on arm64 too , and my patch actually works . : p
yup
and it does work fine , accessing it from the terminal .
it certainly is ! : ) i was just talking to ian how his storage update seems to me a
not up to me
no problem
maybe you reproduced before the revert
most likely your issue is n't so much with the browser , but rather poorly written javascripts on the pages
wiat sec
apt-cache policy libkf5networkmanagerqt6
time to test then ?
i noticed a few other failures in that listing that do n't look racy
so the issue looks to be that the cups daemon process is not allowed to access files under /home/user/ which
ok
are you behind a proxy or restricted network ?
is there no scope to use virtualbox ?
let me see
does it drop the adb or what ?
trusty didnt see the wifi card either , so i played around with bios and just cant find it
idk how much that 'd save you though
./program ( from where-ever the program is )
if you know of a thunderbird plugin that 'd be great
but note that aruntu is not ubuntu and is not supported here . go to their site for support
yeah , that 's the target : )
my situation is that i am wondering about that situation
you have to insert a disk ... .
btw , any news on silo 10 ? can we get somebody to push the magic button ? ; )
my favorite to deal with the 'rc ' marked packages ' dpkg -- list |grep `` ^rc '' | cut
ok , it looks good to me with the details you added in your email .
firmware-atheros ?
when officially done , it will more look a desktop version
hmm
it will send mails just fine
thats ... not what you want
right it 's in the paste above
yeah it 's sneaky . spreadsheet replacement will be clearer about this
it 's *not* omitempty
i thought as much .
so it was always wrong
thats boreing for me -sorry - you should check the docs about it
what error does it report ?
oh , ok
firewall blocking issue , routing issue , configuration issue , etc .
no . itried with and without it
looks like surface stack is sending a null surface pointer to the observers
that 's only debian based distro 's such as ubuntu , which this channel is for .
apparently not any better sadly : (
from the nvidia specs . page : `` one dual link dvi-i , one dual link dvi-d , one mini-hdmi

right
downgrade branch landed
# # linux-ssd
i 'm in the next room , fyi
for chroot you do n't need that , just mount the required file systems , not forgetting about /proc as
but debuild -s fails ...
you own a bike surely it goes with the territory
oh sorry , i thought that 's systemd_wants
that setting was off , turned it on andddddd .
a dist-upgrade wo n't install it
you could either find a ppa for openjdk 8 , or compile/install manually , or go to oracle.com and follow
ask your specific problem here in chat
`` linux < kernel verion > splash quiet noplymouth ... ... . ''
just keep reporting them to both myself and ahayzen and we 'll figure out who 's responsible ... it 's
and once you get the build environment set up , it 's always ready for further use : )
yeah , runtime works
or is this there right after boot ?
just treat anything inside the extened partition the same as you would a primary partition
which script btw ?
which version & flavor of *buntu are you using ?
does your screen show `` starting version 219 '' ?
or sorry , /home/etc/fstab
the same concerns certainly apply
is there a way i can add uefi later , if i create a 100 mb partition for it now
can we maybe reupload kickinz1|away 's snapp as .canonical ?
what desktop ?
k. agreed . so is the hard drive that comtains your operating system thje booting hard drive as set in
as long as you 're sure you are altering the correct partition you _should_ be fine but always make sure
fritsch has some minimal server install guide somewhere though
i bet that depends heavily on the used gamepad
i 'm already trying to install bcmwl-kernel-source
good to go , but the tracker for some reason is n't letting me push the bits .
wicj os did you create from ?
cjwatson , happy new year btw ; - )
hi
so the ssh connection fails if you supply a password eh ?
what should i do after that ?
: )
nope , looking at log files
:3
awesome !
then read the manpage of nmcli .
yep , no problem
15.04 actually , am i borked ?
as in , find a different company to pay for hosting .
im curious : p
ask in # freenode
yeah it 's the lightest weight and that is a netbook which ... i would throw away .
ok , can you run parted -l
sorry had my javascript turned off took some time to figure that out
the silo ppas now depend on the overlay ppa so it should take care of itself should n't it ?
though i did n't try wily in the overlay ppa if that 's what you mean
and adding hundreds of different error types is a serious maintenance burden
it probably should bind-mount most of its mounts , but i was going for minimally-invasive , not knowing the code
may just be luck
ok
i did scroll all the way to the bottom just to make sure . nothing is higher than 0.5 %
/ mrsamm_ please research the programs you where given before complaining they do n't work
you 've got access to the source right ? what apps do you need that still use a panel ?
i also intend to add bugbmp tomorrow .
( i wish that tomb logged errors when it threw them away )
i set it to legacy and not uefi
oh , i like ranting about systemd too : p
ack
i 'm dreading the conversation that has me walking him through setting up that on the router -- but if
we are trying to run the tests as ci would
was a full wipe or did you save stuff from /home ?
cg on : fedora works , arch works , debian works , gentoo works ... etc ... etc ... only
i actually do n't care . if you prefer , i can follow the autopilot style everywhere , starting from
do you use a nexus 4 for development ?
all the servers i have in digitalocean have that possibility , since creation
i dont know if its documented , i dont know how i found it : ) . i know it
well that too is not working
what version you have right now
wich ubuntu version ?
^
there is already a metacity ubuntu3 package in my ppa , should n't i remove to upload the latest ubuntu3
will there be a way to set what dns servers to use without adding a file like i did ?
hmm , how do i call it ?
you do n't get it , i 'm talking about installing to a real partition , not from one .
try a secondary dvd , both dvd 's pass the integrity test , both have the same behaviour , but
i see , so not really open and fair ?
also , do it without the space before /msg
dd command
: )
what was the ufw command you wanted me to try ?
yes , landscape
tedg : so anything that 's not a click ?
i 'm sure it can be , since 15,04 still uses several 4.14 packages
yes
testing on vivid with upstart now
no problem buddy .
well , there should be a reason why it failes to boot . we need that info to see how

yes and no
yay

apt-cache search indicator ( from terminal ) will make you a list of nice unity indicators also
cool
only barely . goodnight !
thought so . wonder is if a private instance could be hosted ... i could do curious things with that
are you able to connect from your mint host to netflix ?
you can join the membership board meeting to support him : d we accept supporters : )
live cd would be the best bet
need mps , not branches
yes
so it turns out that clock app is crashign due to the bottom edge which uses the get ( )
i 'm on 340.76 since it is the most recent that supports both gpus . you should use the latest
well i tried to help .
and did you attempt any of what i said ?
huh ? if you start over in a new ppa you should use 0ubuntu1 . do n't make too many
the program needs to have the file open ( before you can read or write a file , you need
does booting off of a live session work ?
just use sudo , never root

you can use alis to find the utorrent channel if any here ; going for transmission , or any of

`` keycode 23 = control_l b ''
check , say , win7/8 , where a failed boot or unclean shutdown will present you with a menu with
igloo building and sledging : )
so , i ca n't connect to the machines , and ca n't even bootstrap
im using as many standardsettings as possible
works great ! much obliged
but debootstrap used to be pretty sensitive to packages ordering ( there 's a bit of dumb luck involved )
yes i like you ascii diagram solution
ty . i do n't think we have to actually fix it just yet , so just prioritization with some
no , that should work just fine
you might want a different adapter .
nah sounds like a terrible idea . why do you use 3 separate pcs ? why not just one with
not true , it 's really relevant
boot from cd :
ai n't it better to make luks containers for your critical data rather than go full disk encryption ?
well , you have to be a bit more specific . ideally , you should just go for it and
which should be in sync with 15.04
also nvidia replaces system libraries for it 's drivers to work whereas amd ones compile an interface .
i know but , but how often does that come up ? : - )
mvo : actually looking at recent source code from systemd , if /etc/machine-id is not present conditionfirstboot is satisifed and
i reccomend you installing the specific performance firmware then reinstall ubuntu fresh
if that doens't work what else can i do ?
and whats your /etc/hostname ?
?
oh , did n't notice you were done for the day , sorry
i have been seeing so many similar problems like this
cheers , i 'll give that a try in a bit
with -- built-tree ? that 's not right , it should n't build anything .
name change . i have no idea , i had no part in it .
btw i installed mysql-server-5.5 and it seems that fixed the problem
this is related to 15.04 and i am guessing maybe systemd - plugging in a monitor makes the server instantly
did you tell juju to expose owncloud ?
the panels are defaulted.. fact.. if you dont have the config backed up , then its gone
if you intend to do any gaming i suggest you switch to the nvidia-proprietary driver
well , in case of this branch : lp : ~mardy/ubuntu-system-settings-online-accounts/rtm-fixes , the only thing that did n't get merged
i do have an issue with documentroot points to /var/www/html/
i sent a email to the membership board
unfortunately i botched that by changing the url on the wordpress config page , so i guess first of all
hey ?
and it was never saved ?
the swap should be the same size as your memory
oh ok , well please do not speak to me if you do n't wish to be spoken back to
yes
yes , the netmask is that
but yeah , no word on the audio roles yet , mzanetti do you have an idea how public the
what 's the number ?
it < should > pickup most hardware automagically ... some , like video drivers ( nvidia , etc ) and
either
i thought the plan was always to do all the mrs in the same silo ?
sounds good
that way , it would be steady all year long for the saner countries ; - )
pretty much
please give me the info i 've asked for
i just wondered because some docs for the click packaging said `` we want it to be distro-agnostic ''
yes . maybe the guys in # xubuntu know better about xfce specifics
sure , unity8 is just leaner still , and we 'll try and keep that as we build more desktop
whats scary about it ?
how can i check if they are actually there ?
pastebin the output of what i asked please
version , device ? etc . ?
which ubuntu release are you using ?
would be possible to share some of the code of the mate integration plugin with the gnome one ?
do you have an example from within the last week ?
only problem is that now the status job pings all status changes every 10 minutes , so if your build
yup , but they do share code .
thats the exact opposite of security

do you have a backup of the important files you need ?
did you md5sum the .iso and the usb ?
cat /proc/filesystems is same , on android and ut
you typed in sudo groups
can you try to create a new user , to test if that also corrupts unity ?
i 've done it before back when i was a crazy bofh , do n't remember if i messed up
my tests , and what the documentation say
odd indeed , the others do n't have text , and the test would basically make no sense if there

true
so you think installing the .run directly from nvidia can actually work ?
for that purpose there is media-hub which handles audio and video playback in a centralized manner
it uses ecm_optional_add_subdirectory ( ) is that not right ?
try libktorrent , same basic issue as clementine
except for the obvious memory leak ; )
the problem is geoclue-2.0
to me that was confusing because it looked like _linux , _darwin , _windows etc . and made me question

you do not want wordproccesor friendly quotes in a script
how 'd you get patched ?
have you got intel hd graphics integrated graphic card ?
i asked cause i dont know about ubuntu
at least now it does n't crash , and i 've some thoughts on things to try to fix it
yes i experienced the same problem
i press d , then it says new ?
i suspect it 's more likley down to your setup/config
s-i-shell gpg signs it after every change ... editing by hand doesnt : )
which ubuntu release is that on ?
why not 3x ?
change the last two lines to those at /usr/share/xfce4/helpers/firefox.desktop

fonts in files browser also look thin before running command you gave
i 'm on a nexus4
yes but the drivers from amd 's site is also installed , which is why my graphics is messed up
still working on cellular that is needed before i push an update , and yeah device flash works
i did n't do that because i though that the u1 plugin had been changed in all this time
ok then some change in systemd might cause it or the ifup-wait-all-auto.service is new
like e.g . state.addipaddress ( )
yes that should work , but perhaps i am wrong
it 's some really old 32 bit intel box

yes
i learned many important things during my years with the community
yup , retailers and so forth spoil it
the boot-loader goes on the physical disk device not a partition .
yes , it 's misleading

after a unity crash unity just keeps on crashing everytime i run a test
not really
look at my first response
that output is norming , but mysql stopping is not normal .
but i guess setting it to the same as the network name *for now* should be fine

probably : - )
the lxc one seems entirely unhappy in general .
however as we have network-manager now we want network-manager to control eth0 rather than ifupdown

libavahi-common3 is already the newest version . i did install the pacakage libavahi-common-dev . tho
in windows i can but in ubuntu i cant select these just with pressing and hold the right click because
you can burn 'plop boot manager ' to a cdrom then force usb to boot
as the printer is unlikely to need access to the interner , changing default gateway of the printer will probably

are they the same machines ?
you 're also taking some other situation and trying to necessarily apply it to this situation
do n't worry about it , no biggy
it starts that is not the problem .
i have done a backup : - )

no , you can learn
do n't think nvidia driver support for mir is in a good shape . might ask in # ubuntu-mir what

so i can stay connected and get history
i just like being able to have as less packages as possible , while maintaining full control over workflow that
as am i
this does not sound like a good plan anymore , surely someone must be able to complete this ?
share with what other thing ?
so i should make a boot repair live usb ?
after adding that ppa , reload : sudo apt-get update
i got the benchmark gui working before . i 'll send you a link when i 've tested these changes
it should show the window and complain that you do n't have a key
you realise goarch will be arm , not armhf , on arm boards ?
but it would be nice to have it all generic
that does n't sound like fun at work . ; )

i restart the device and i can see the notification

we wo n't happrove it till you do approve it too
aha , so a revert would fix that , right ?

...

sorry , which silo are you talking about now ?
oh , when you said ssh port that sounded like you were reconfiguring sshd
cfhowlett : sorry guys for being stupid
and by line 3685 ipv4 addressing , routing and dns are all configured . so that was a good connection
nops , it does not taking my last password
curious , are you `` already in windowed mode '' when you plug in to the monitor ?
you using any plugins or just vanilla ?
ow
let 's give it something to do - > sudo apt-get update , sudo apt-get upgrade < - .
ah . well i someone else has probably posted that ruleset somewhere , right ? i can probably figure out
or a port ( have n't tested that though )
aha ! noted : )
and ?
during installation , i downgraded to apparmor-easyprof-ubuntu 1.3.12 , the version in the silo ppa .
the variable is only used and updated from one goroutine so there 's no issue
i just noticed cause it 's ( still ) in the release notes .
1 more question . ca n't get wifi and or cant ' get a hardwire connection ?
apt-get upgrade does nothing ... versioning has n't changed ?
and , of course , if you 're flying through dulles or national and have a long enough layover ,
ooo . file a bug
ok ! updating it now
that user does n't exist in the sampledata .
for ( ; ; ) ; do reisio++ ; done
yeah , i 'd ask on the upstream ml about that , this seems ood
and listspaces also returns an error
\o/ happy birthday ! ! !
those are the `` who owns it '' names , not the `` who tests it '' .
sorry.. dont know what you mean
true
catch that exception and fallback to downloading the package from the ppa ?
i was wondering how important opencryptoki is
him being the telegram guy : )
afaik it is not a feature that exists even on android
right , but that 's just 2 methods and still rather luck-dependent
so i leave to fs to ext4 and upgrade to hwe kernels
we also have to refactor various bits of upstart-specific code throughout juju core to be init-system agnostic : (
yea - but i 'm grabbing seperate figures for b1
what are you talking about ?
as is mine : ) ok but it might go screwy carrying on without a reboot . try mapping the

i 'll deploy ovs-odl and start looking at the north/south traffic issues bjornt hit
what 's the name of the installer package again ?
i always shutdown via desktop button ; - )
did you or did you not download kubuntu ?
sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get upgrade in a terminal
so i have asked for those to be rerun , and we should recheck when that compltests
use the one from the store . : )
if that is correct we can paste some log files
ty , am finishing a branch will look soon
the only change that would affect apparmor in motion is the move of frameworks to their own dir /frameworks

any interesting logs in ~/.cache/upstart/*settings* ?
no
my talk will be in english
sure.. fork it , then
ya , the ppa does n't have the right version , it 's buggy for me as well
cat ? cp ?
whatever is stable by feature freeze , looks like 1.6 from where we stand at the moment
that is a good question ; i am trying to remember the way i ended up implimenting it .
no , it was weekend , got phone call , server is down , what is going on , i
they are in any case useless noise
which rc-proposed release do you have ?
probably has more to do with your isp . it 's not an exact science .
what ca n't i use the package now ?
paste output following the command please
sorry , what are you running where ?
if the problem persists , analyze resource usage to see wether you need even more ram or cpu or both
right
can you do a ls /dev | grep sd and tell us how it goes ?
meh , ok
he 'd have to talk to ibm about the feature , i ca n't say . i doubt replacing i5/os
basically we just handle bugs and publish the thing . not much of contents creation .
it 's set up to use the one on the home partition right now
no , sorry .

i have no clue about cameras , sorry
how so ?
well eds is the black box here that we 're poking too hard at
why ? nothing wrong with dist-upgrade ...
yes
yes , but then why do we need threads ?

no . each user can start virtual machine manager and use its gui to start/stop and access its 'screen '

so what would you do ?
you can remove your face if you want
hmmm , does it boot up though and you just lose video ? can you ssh in to the box
?
it may be , i will double check
to me , in this context , they mean exactly the same thing
do you have a full /tmp/ or anything like thatz ?
i am < true name >

all the bug reports which contain errors of this nature i have so far investigated all ended up to be
any luck on bringing the interfaces up and having a link on them ?
i 'm exciting if it means the hook is gone afterwards : )
ohh , sorry . for the vanguard to take it up
possibly yes , but find the drivers first ... find the chipset first .
this all ties into the complex way we mangled britney to handle partial unstable , but normally speaking that gets

what kind of data ?
you were kicked last time you trolled in here . so stop it or leave . dont waste the volunteers
my questions earlier referred to an ubuntu server
there is no ip conflict
and you want that published to rtm ?
ok - run sudo lxc-ls -- fancy and pastebin the output for me
if you built without source , you have to give the .dsc explicitly
what my problem was ... i had duplicate entries in the new /etc/apt/sources.list file as compared to /etc/apt/sources.list.d from adding
ok , let me be clearer -- click.rules is no longer shipped in wily , therefore there are no fakeenv
we were using trusty juno cloud archive and upgrading to kilo cloud archive . the mongodb version we ended up
is this at the conference 's wifi ? or the hotel ?
depends on what the corruption is , might only be a few bits here and there

sorry to hear that , but forks are not supported here , elementary has its own issues
that might be the issue ... i 'm trying to download it 's driver .. but it 's not working

what partition ?

so this is a known bug then ?

i was tending towards that as the problem but seemed a little odd with the timing , i.e . a
no guarantees man . i 'm not ubuntu expert . just sharing stuff from around the webs . netinstall is

thing is , it seemed to work without a hitch on windows 7 as far as i could see ,
i have attempted to apply for jobs
the alternative of renaming everything to be suffixed with -qt4/-qt5 was selected by eg fedora , but then again upstream
sent to you
36m of logs
what app is requiring java_home to be set ?
interesting , logged out , logged back in . same problem : dbus_session_bus_address points to a non-existent dbus socket
yeah , i 've done the yelling that i can do , sadly i ca n't actually fix it
try applying nomodeset anyway and booting 'try ' mode
heh , ok , what about bug fixes in the test tools we use ; - )
thats the offical qt upstream statement
ruby-hashie , ruby-rspec , ruby-safe-yaml , ruby-test-unit
ok . i 'll do that
if the message is n't received because of the amount of people in the channel , something is broken ,
anyway i have no proof of steve 's approval but just realized that this dramatically reduces the amount of maintainance
yeah ... any eta on freeing ?
it does n't work on xenial
plasma 5.2 in vivid is stable . are you running 5.2.0 ?
dpkg -l phpmyadmin

listsubnets does n't make extra calls per subnet , so either it all works or it all fails
check ubuntu /conky keywords on deviantart , shows alot of happy candy eye users

open a terminal and run sudo dpkg-configure -a
do you have a better idea ? common-post-build-arch doesnt work because it runs in fakeroot
: p
i do not think so ...
port forwarding normally responds to a dhcp address given from the router
sure
yup , rsync goes to a network drive , and deja dup encrypts & backs up to s3
i would assume ubuntu puts it there
ttp request sent , awaiting response ... 200 ok
or gnome
it probably does n't work on something obscure .
it all works fine on the desktop
i have deleted the contents of the other folders
really ? works for me with a different project on qastaging
good point ! i never remember the names properly ...
we could compare /etc/networkmanager/system-connections/eduroam from both the phone and desktop and see if there are differences
for start : have you been drinking tonight , or is this sober behavior ?
... let me try some other things , i suspect that it is my fault ...

it my be a file owner issue
and then sudo usermod -s /bin/bash root
yes it 's normal , your desire for connecting via hostname has nothing to do with the hosts file :
initial numbering - 1 for new facades , 0 for facades that existed before versioning
the md5 windows program output is very different from the sha256 on the kubuntu webpage
press ctrl+c to interrupt/terminate the command , and try it again
hypothetically if the issue is with the monitor not being correctly identified , i presume i 'd have to install
i made it : ) but it would be fun to integrate it as real part of the sdk
( that seems mainly to point to a failure to separate the behaviour from the transport ? one would think
how did it break ?
you 'll get a prompt back when it completes
right
okay
try 'wav ' only , just a guess .
ack
42
do we have to wait til tomorrow for that ?
ok. well that 's a decision for integration into debhelper anyway . not a reason to block the mir .
i know you tried to duplicate . i tried looking into the lubuntu-default-settings but i could n't see any clue
bindsym $ mod+z exec ... .. not mod-z
it does , it mentions enabling the partner repo then installing skype and skype-bin together
if you need more than 10m , let me know . : p
you know gary player ?
would you mind pasteing it ?
ok . but if i install the 331 by using the repo i get a blank screen on startup .
i 'm going to be in chicago next week so wanted to chat before i end up in an awkward
i have inet on my windows
ubuntu support is all .
how would i do all that ?
what about downloading the stuff to disk , into the apt cache instead ? would be much easier
that a pin not be used for wrapping the user data encryption key
take our advise and choose a flavor and full install
try an older kernel
yeah , possible
something is very wrong . while charging , all of a sudden display turns on , big full battery icon
nope , they are broken atm .
i typed that command above , and get this error
ok , well , as long as it does n't get terribly confused when its cgroup ends up being empty
sorry i dont know what setup that guy got there .
when i upgrade my ram in my laptop i 'll give it a go : d
what exactly are you trying to do ?
there are 500 gb ssd 's on amazon for under $ 250
type exit
there is no bios settings
^ this is bad style for production code ( susceptible to symlink attacks and dos ) , but probably tolerable
i need you to read some notes on it rpadovani
it 's also the greybird theme which is the default xubuntu theme
it fails to register
no problem . ; )
so in looking 1 : they 're fixing , 2 : they 're fixing , 3 : ...
hehehe , you just jump right on in there eh ? : d
unless you have changed the user password without syncing the 2 , in which case try using the previous user
anyway , this does n't block the ddeb flag in lp , does it ?
when it failed , i aborted , cleared loop0p5 , and redid
right
im using bridged network and they have the same subnet and they can ssh to each other ; but somehow
k ; you are attempting to boot up ubuntu on the hard drive , do you boot to the desktop
i 'm running 14.04 with the backports resulting in kde 4.14.2
removed the old package ; this at least takes zygrib off the `` urgent fixme '' list in favor of
i see your point
unittest.skiptest or unittest2.skiptest ?
i guess i was wanting to see multiple retries
well it just probably used mkswap and swapon on it . nothing special . you 're safe : )
other than distributing the .ps1 ?
and , apps could have their own colors on the ambiance theme . without defining their own theme
but did you try running modeswitch for it ?
obviously once you 've told me i 'm going to hug you ! : -p
i 've got to run , i 'm having trouble finding the best docs on that feature..

: ) the unity8 team just heard about it first time today
just checked i use flash
yah , i really like systemd .
well , it kinda is !
can you give me a hint ?
are you talking about cloud computing ? because it 's only expensive if you greatly over estimate your requirements
why did it block the wifi interface ? i never asked for this )
that should work fine
4.3.26
so maybe when we got the first wily export a lot of translations were n't imported into wily yet ;
and this is really integration testing , so works better this way
and sudo parted -l
this just let me choose which drive to start , but not which partition .
is n't mutex needed when we are writing to the same file ?
justcloud
if you customize your grub menu and perform apt-get upgrade without reading the output , i would guess you can
anyway
randy ?
yes you can . its recommended to backup first .
yes that kernel is a bit problematic with nvidia
they are already not managed , all you really do is connect/disconnect , and if you really want you could
nope but seen others using it and linking to their own setups for pics etc
faster is not the better solution
wtf
fyi ^
`` close '' ; - )
assuming the appropriate parties see that bug : )
yes , it was tested
yeah that should work better
look in troubleshooting and you will see the links you need . the first is under 'using autopilot vis '
we use it to
ahhhh ok. no do n't use it .
yeah , i know . machine time is cheap , it 's just the me waiting around time that is
you mean in startup items ?
10.227.27.122 this is your wifi ip ... can you ping 10.227.24.1 ?
seems the user installed core expecting something closer to the desktop , and if the user is a first timer
it runs on `` bare metal '' , there is no dalvik/art .
i consider packages not being built to be an error condition : -p
will look in a sec , hangon
ack
you can also try a no_acpi boot
ahhh , ok . it sounded as if it was a gateway/router issue . so the server is directly connected
anyway . so now that 14.04.3 is out , you can come to the lug tonight : d
do you have a specific ubuntu support question ? : )
seems odd that we 'd be checking the agent status , rather than the unit status ... what 's the
like acpi ?

does it ? i 'd suggest not nominating anyone then it lands on the review queue for all to see
as in dmesg or something else ?
i extracted & adapted only the fix for the cups_server override . details are in the comments with reference to

not so , ubuntu goes above and for drivers
see the dmesg if there is a hardware issue with the disk
if not i 'll look at it
is there a new way to do that , or someone still has to do it manually ?
ok , let 's see then , do you already have a methodology to decide ?
it 's a copy of uctheme api , prepared to deisplay deprecation note on mr # 4

how did you install it ?

you 'd be good at it hto
with what command syntax ?
it 'll ask for your account password

my core dev account expired while i was on holiday . do you know what i have to do to
you can also do it more indirectly , with udevadm trigger -- sysname-match=eth0
with the evo or pro version ?
there are no packaging changes
i have done those and looked back at the ls ... my perms still show the same
the first one installs a program which uploads command output to paste.ubuntu.com - the second lists your mounted disk partitions
make it a requirement , people will conform : - )
what 's your preferred approach ?
no ... i 'm talking about adding a new user
please file a bug against lp : bileto that says something like `` display giant warning when dest ppa field
a live os boots independantly of the installed os , so you must not be explaining correctly
that happens using which ubuntu , and when doing what ?
i 'd rather not : )
the pidgin developers ppa is deprecated
# wifi
not 100 % sure about 17 yet
ok
i admit to not having a clue how subordinate charms work !
well , feel free to contribute to make light-locker better.. : p
what did you do in between when it was working and when it was n't
this is as much about responsibility as it is about permissions , it 's been amazingly frustrating to try to
you dont . the ppa maintainer needs to do that
yeah , but im not 100 % it is that to be completely honest .
the bug does n't occur in either the horizontal or inverted horizontal orientations
can i write an app that talks to webdm and it will not be broken down the line ?
yes , for sysv-init
sorry , wdym ?
putty hanged up and could not connect i do not know what is the problem
do you have a link to such an api script ?
how do i uninstall my existing mongodb-server
do you get some useful output and a getty there ?
we need another co working day where i can ask you questions
check the log
in theory ? set up acls for the folders and files
i would suggest getting things up and running , and then if it 's all working well , go to
np
and just fix windows
i thought you 'd tested it with everything except webdm ?
cool , just making sure others know .
god i hope not . when i worked support i hated it when people would call me up for easy
but then their username would be root23 - not root
but this old prolog based syntax makes many people wonder
?
j'ai un rhume , je me sense faible : /
`` the network configuration file ' ? ?
why you guys do n't you client with gui ? : |
you know i 'm kind of pragmatic due to what i had to do on ubuntu touch and such ;
just like this ? -- dpkg -s 'python*\/encodings ? ?
# ubuntu-arm iirc . see ! alis
no . i asked you if there were any errors .
scheduled and updated ubuntuonair.com
if it does break after all this revamp , we can work on it slowly to fix it . until
will do
sorry , but i 'd rather have logs i can search in than a screenshot of half a log
one mo
the last page has a few
the manifest has alot of cm downloads.. thats why i asked . or else i wouldnt have asked
with -- upload-tools ?
for the official ubuntu packages ...
i keep thinking about it : ) maybe an xmas pressie for me : )
hah yeah , that might actually be an improvement
modem is short for modulator demodulator - it is the circuit that takes a ( usually analog ) signal and
hmmm maybe its a bad leftover from bumblebee ? did you try nvidia-prime on a clean install ?
i wish i could connect to your box remotely so i could see this installation screen for myself . i
maybe disable iptables for a while and see if it works ?
sure !
you could disconnect your ubuntu disk , install to the other , reconnect and boot ubuntu- then run `` sudo
great !
it 's linux monitoring : )
yes working on a mp3 player , but i wanted it from scratch
i wanted benjamin to take a look before that .

they talk about intelligent hiding of the panel , and the picture shows a nice app launcher
does the moment where the crash happens involve closing or stopping some app ?
sorry , just dropped out ( keyboard problems , stuck capslock )
i could help , but sadly no clue how to fix your problem
sounds like you have an alternative approach to try then - using the nvidia-settings setup
hrm , thats alarming
probably like 2 or 3 ; )
can you not drop to safe mode recovery console and run a chkdsk ?
also it seems buggy that clock has to drop the use of audioroles in preparation of an update , it
but the exact error code , which environment variable holds this ?
then you will need not the jre , but the jdk
which java did you install ?
quality metrics service
it 's not opensource
afaik you could branch from a base branch , which would be the equivalent of the prerequisirte , but i
what 's better about it ?
14.10 : (
can you paste ?
yes
mind reviewing my branch ?
naah .
ok ubuntu-mate-settings and ubuntu-mate-artwork are good to go from my point of view .
ack
i ca n't see any usb device ...
hop over to # zfsonlinux and let 's get you up and running with a real file system ; )
it 's the auto stanza
yeah it is , it is more .config than gui changing is all .
ok so then its just gallery in silo 4
i have no luck finding the line
ha ha - i 'm just going to take that as cue ...
it should show you that your rule is being executed
maybe because it needs to diff around 2.5gb against another 2.5gb , something runs out ?
it 's one of my favourite activities
you 're not being very coherent
maybe you have a linux on that machine with grub , before you added ubuntu ? so you have a
i just managed to do a full run without it crashing : /
so could be a few things . but i would first check auth.log on the server . pastebin the last
i mean it , you 're clearly not versed in this stuff so please do n't try and help people
ok
bduk was last seen 13 days , 20 hours , 48 minutes and 28 seconds ago in # ubuntu-za on
you gave an error -1 ...
they are in syslog
heh , i 'm here all the time : )
yes try it single install
lol ! now what reason could that possibly be ?
lubuntu never seems to give me any trouble , and it boots pretty fast . it 's a nice blank
also , you can try disabling the onboard video in the bios .
the -- private being the default comes as a requirement from mark
the machine has never rebooted since the day we set it up ( except for the very very ocasional update
you can click on window icon ( left-upper corner ) to invoke menu and there you can make rules for

now that all my students have ubuntu on their computers , i 'll have some fun with that
you can install in uefi mode if you want
please ? ? ? ? ?
this isnt he channel to spam random things
i 've reset the bios to its default settings , `` usb legacy '' is enabled
dobey : i ca n't keep track of more conversations right now , sorry
nope they just kinda same ilk which is why i mentioned them : )
what if it was a laptop with only a single drive ?
no worries
dbarth_ : /usr/share/session-migration/scripts/
so maybe zfs on both ?
but i 'm very much open to discussion , i just come with opinions and , hopefully , arguments
esperanto for hawk , i guess the hawk-eyed will find something to sync no matter what or where ; )
by the way , i have taken over the post as danish coordinator for gnome . the coordinator job for

congrats ! to what packate ?
expect another respin in the afternoon
yep
kk
for some reason , it does n't seem like it 's in launchpad , but it was logged in redhat
good point , will do
but no worries , drive , i have it all under control
so thew tracker is listing today - that direct current shows the 6th
k ; also insre that you are booting in ccsm mode , if this box is uefi endowed . (
earlier someone said lucid was eol
so what 's holding up the 'sudo parted -l | pastebinit ' ?
ok , so long as it dies a quick death

maybe you have the thing in your pocket , and are using audio-only walking navigation ?
i needed to lookup the language codes for afrikaans , because the script was not supporting it , lol
good
2 out of 2 hunks failed -- rejects in file krita/sketch/cmakelists.txt
1.8 is recommend
yes.. maybe that 's it . do you think going back with the live usb and changing that would do
it should be , but as i said , it 'll return a lot of extra data than what you
ack .
the master hdd is ubuntu , the slave is windows
so should i look at filing mirs or see if fop build without libfontbox-java and libmockito-java ?
sure , just trying to see if a bug is fixed .
i ca n't think of anything gpu driver related that should/could affect log-in
im downloading it now ... lol
yeah , after changing , it works
updated
yes , yes
oh , we should remove that terror warning
i did the latter anyway ( used deploy and not add-machine )
pass it through a converter and look at it in a browser ?
nvidia-340 ( i.e . w/o the updates ) is also causing the flickering . now i 'm trying noveau
regarding the config.yaml , i may have uncovered a bug
the older kernel does n't boot , either .
it would allow alt-tab to scroll through everything normally rather than group
right , i 'll make that clear .
kaleo fix going to be ready soon
ah , you can fortunately avoid that currval . will mention it when i do the full review .
good question .
well , i do n't do it , so no problem ; but i have discount chocolate panettone and i
i guess but it 's less headache with a public cert : - )
also , having a boot-manager built in to avoid the stupid problems of oss over-writing each others boot-loaders on the
yes , ubuntu 15.10 all updated
you cant switch from high to lower , a fresh clean install is reccomended
in which case , can we use that bug ?
is anyone from the security team looking into the libstagefright issue on the phone ( sorry for the echan )
neither did normal
i ca n't see if it has a result or not
i wonder if we should maybe do a 15.10 `` release '' and move current trunk to 15.04 , nothing
i 'm documenting the benchmarking in apache-hadoop-plugin and am trying to get a description for it
cool .
how long ?
go to their webpage and get the latest version ?
see above , add the repos and do apt-update then apt-upgrade
just a general question
oh , you my have visited a different machine even if you had . these tests are run on stilson-08
do you have the .click for the app ?
bestter to fix conflict first
it is , indeed
i cant remember the exact problem , when booting a live usb said something like boot probe failled pcc
nautilus-dropbox is installed ?
apt-cache policy packagename
well it 's my own mess to begin with ; /
yaaay
i just pushed some more changes to the branch
do i need the unity8 ppa on wily as well ? or does it come with all packages
i got your mail . there 's some exciting stuff with snappy and phone testing coming up . the first
if you 're asking for the version , how can i find out ?
then find out the dependencies of the meta package ; )
check if there is a log for lxc-android-config in /var/log/upstart
can you pick up the baton ?
maybe you can share the g+ post on the kubuntu page to the kubuntu community ?
what os are you using now ?
good morning
yeah ... but it does not have wifi , and so i can only share something if its connected to
please let me to the task
yeah : p
*lots* of different vms , from tiny to huge . just trying to illustrate that raid6 works well . you
gentoo is a source based distro . you compile every piece of software yourself .
lol more then three lol
bug # 1402597 first i 'd say
how do you suggest that i check
well if you are , you can go and get what you damned well want , when you damned well
you mean the `` cat picture delivery system '' ?
have a good day !
without
can you pastebin what you 're doing from start to finish ?
when i use the fglrx-updates the ps runs a lot hotter
you 're being ridiculous
yeah oh well , he might get the same answers when he gets back
what those expression do is basically catch a certain part of the request ui , remove it and apply it
good
/dev/pts can be more important
you might use | while read
try to get the exact version number of everything in there ideally to be sure you 're not looking at
disable the auto-update function or be prepared to override with the procedure you just performe
yep , there we go , i can install dolphin now : ) ... i 'll try libplasma3 in a
i had problems with it too : (
. and .. are just concepts
worth while trying to track down which process is chatting so much by having a read through the logs and
ok , i 'll email with a branch & instructions
sorry i could n't provide more info ...
how is it different from canonistack ? why would it be a lab thing ?
ok , makes sense
but it 's also wakeupreq
i 've tried it with and without the text preceding the colon
/etc/fstab lists your mountpoints and which devices are mounted there . /etc/crypttab is cryptsetup configuration
i 'm sure there 's lots of little bits that need changes but a nice milestone
can you pastebinit it ?
it installs utopic 's kernel on trusty .
can you past /etc/fstab ?
i thought this was done with the updates
ok , type sudo efibootmgr -v | nc termbin.com 9999
yes expected , but you probably did n't get the silo stuff unless you pinned it if you are running
no i wasnt aware of that but would that let me run a vbox headless server with 64bit guests ?
i 've never checked if that happens ; my dell 's do the same thing though with the boot-time warning
if you are interested in cloning what happens on the dashboard , this is how ci does it . essentially
so you want me to destroy environment again ? there 's nothing else to poke at with the current env
all push notifications are sent via push.ubuntu.com
i could.. id like to see if i can figure out the issue tho : )
oh , i see now , indeed , hwe- kernels : /
fakechroot : )
with the live cd ?
the 'gui ' is automatically installed and started when the system boots
does n't work like that on ubuntu
and you make sure that it does n't work with /usr and root ?
( fastboot boot boot.img )
done , plus 1.22-beta1 going through landing tests
yes , some abstract currency would be the best
take it down with the same tool you brought it up with , is all
do you need a disk drive ?
oh , i did n't add `` full_build=true '' , should i pass this as an environment variable ?
its critical , i assume it is locking
`` a bit '' .
^
current cidr
can you comment on the bug with the url/video you are using
it 's typically always supposed to be a text file
well that 's sort of why i was advocating a worker.errstopped
is that wily ?
must confusing is frame buffer stuff
do you know anything about the backporting ones ?
i moved it to under testing
you can make the launcher hide fulltime . but i dont think you can get rid of the panel .
have you seen my trello comments ?
then they 're probably a better audience than here
read the kern.log and syslog ( in /var/log/ ) . it may be the hardware is n't correctly re-initialised on
pastebin your apt log
no , what you read was that at that current point in development , it used slightly more
on the other system i am instead passing root=/dev/sdax , while ubuntu generates it as root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu-vg-root
y u no sleep ?
next time leave it , for hours , it should recover : d
i 'm not up on fglrx is all , this a supported release as of now ?
troll what ?
basically schroot seems grumpy/ca n't unmount userdirs it mounts with the default fstab
interesting
ta !
type sudo ubuntu-drivers devices | nc termbin.com 9999
trying to get that list of language simplified , we have a solution which is not perfect but should be
fair enough . i just was n't sure what it 'd do for app updates . e.g . could we
never mind it was still running . just hung up on a 1.1t folder ./media it 's still running
it 's a totally generic sysvinit daemon in /etc/init.d/ that can be launched with service start
live-build/ubuntu-touch/hooks/60-install-click.chroot
fine . complain to toshiba then , ask them to fix the firmware .
meh , ok
really , the iso installed by dd or an app .
the alarm model is provided to the clock app by the ubuntu sdk..clock app just add/removes alarms from the model
yeah , looks similar
ascii is the only correct default for interpreting a bytestring without any other information .
start there . be very careful about any changes you make - in fact , take careful notes .
the first line of your .py file should tell you where your python binary is
i 'd feel a lot less worried about this going out if that was in place
what version of ubuntu ?
and yea i just reproduced it again with upstream qemu . so i 'll hack on that more when i
well , not quite my idea , but yeah , that 'll be pretty good too .
hmm , you 're right , it should n't . looking more closely , i do n't see how we
yes
btw , thx : )
if you create the stable branches , i 'll create the mps
that does n't mean that my tests are foolproof
if the underlying cause was a hardware error , we 'd probably see it on previous kern.log entries , if
and games run fast , vdpau is also on though it 's slow ( high cpu usage )
operations controller by the uniter
ppas are fine .
please stop linking things , try and understand what i told you .
is this known ?
on 15.10 here now , show desktop is fine here though
ok , so i 'll remove the framework bit . maybe some thought needs to be put around something that
cheers - i 'm glad to clarify things where needed
take it from one who has been there and done that .
it also already upon installation installs an init.d script ... defining the start and stop states
looks pretty good hey
a quick check on disk io would be to run top and look at your wait times . if they
again . pleae create a click which exploits the problem you claim exists
gnome-fallback is not a proper 3d desktop . dont call it gnome since that is confusing it with gneom-shell
no , it 's just like ssh to a main server that has restrictions ; it 's still a terminal
rc proposed at this point , but the rest is in silo 53
ugh -- the plague struck ?
the installer will take care of formatting the partition . the default is ext4 .
regarding the data being encrypted i do n't believe it should make a difference what 's in the blocks it
you can not move the unity launcher , no
please put in the pastebin : `` dpkg -l linux-* | awk '/^ii/ { print $ 2 } ' |
understood , and wb as well
hmm , well i hope to start packaging plasma beta today
it 's certainly possible to compile all the bits on other distros , though
your gpu is n't the fastest
ah , good : )
are you thinking you have to have drivers , or you have a problem ?
it has nothing to do with being a beta tester
well , according to raycharles and i , it does do fullscreen .
wd 's make lots of noise , try a nice silent ssd in your machine : p
ok , i 'll make doubly sure i have a backup , and then i 'd like to do a
ok , not long ago then , so we know for sure how the encryption options the installer would offer
did n't know they are cross compiled .
then you know that i only looked at that file to check if it is blocking nm
i fuckign hate that .
`` lsb_release -d '' gives you what ?
should be something like `` sudo click install -- all-users -- root=/usr/share/click/preinstalled foo.click ''
well , there is some reasoning for not enabling the background call automatically , i can explain to you later
right - apparently that 's coming sooner rather than later
tbf , when i installed -dbg , it upgraded the driver too
i hope you do n't mind too much for a string cast here and there : )
oh ok playonlinux says `` ubuntu precise ( and superior ) users : you must install the package wine :
what are you doing ?
but i will show the screenshot you linked
fwiw this is the code i used to generate the table ( and check consistency with the real code )
m trying to land something for 1.22 but keep getting `` no space left on device ''
that 's unthinkable .
tested jitsi and pidgin so far . the log i 've sent you was jitsi 's output .
yes
use version number 15.04 rather than codename
ack . i can see an argument for doing that cleanup automatically , even if it 's an extra flag
xfce , mate , lxde are more streamlined . so they are faster , and *usually* more stable ( but
try sudo apt-get install -- reinstall pam-kwallet
yes security is hard to convince to ppl over enjoyment
if you are using the default that comes with ubuntu that would be unity

when will be your new g+ webapp available ? i do n't like the actual version .
2 : phy0 : wireless lan
except if you are very close to the top of the page , then it will open anyway because you
12.04 has been out way longer . so there are tons of live deployments using it . so yeah ,
think you could upload with a bumped -ubuntu or shall i fix/rebuild ?
yes
no it does n't yet -- that would come later
not about complete netboot
and it does not have .config , but still getting the question on release upgrades
1.8 or 1.9 ?
on my laptop , yes , there are a bunch of files in there
you should be able to mark it as dupe , because you 've created that report
yeah , it should be almost instantaneous
i contacted meizu on friday already , but still awaiting their reply ... hope they are responsive
yay , fake-syncing
hmm , ok . i 'll go with that .
booooooooo . i do n't like that . : p
the reason i brought it up is because of what you said about hook tools not needing to know about
it 's broken the packaging system , nothing can be installed successfully until that 's fixed
so , changing api methods to take tags instead of strings means changing a bunch of cli calls too
we have just one pending silo before we trigger the rc image for arale
no . what about that user just removed that ppa on his own ?
d'oh , just noticed -- bus-type in dbus-test-runner 's help ; )

ppapurge requires the ppa name as parameter . what is the name of this ppa ?

enjoy seating in the plane at least ; )
i 'm strictly looking at the diff between the new package and the package currently in rtm
ok , good luck !
kk
it 's fine now , just took a rebuild
it should definitely start within 2 minutes . more like 5-10 seconds at worst .
good news is that jenkins ran the autopilot and qml tests and found no regressions in your patch ! it
why do you think the user is the problem ? i am mounting another usb drive fine
do you have grub-install or grub2-install ?
fair enough - still sounds tight to me , but if it 's the recommended minumum , it 's something
you boot , then you plug in the dongle and it does not work until you replug ?
is that ok ? is it doable ? please ?
it was hard to tell how much support for the index and products formats that we implemented beyond what we

i 'm in a call with spakiegeek now investingating an issue with maas and juju

you may have to just switch it to legacy mode and install and use your os that way .

hi ... all well ?
did you install 14.04 over cable+ updates enabled ?
i would like to create a cert that has ca=true
how can i know ?
yes , i want my user to use only private keys and his user only passwords
does it show up in /dev/mapper/ < vgname > ?
so lets see if we can land that silo now
( also ... deploy-time and -- to are *very* different ... )
i can live with that and i believe he should
can you give me the command to use please ?
hm , wonder if sergiusens can help you with that
that worked for an output , is there anything else you 'd like to see an output from ?
what i am scared of is that my grub will not tolerate that kind of treatment : p
it 's because the staging area does n't have access to the production overlay ppa , it has a separate

there are some build tests dependencies in some ppa
cheers ( agree with the comment . will fix )
we have jinja and cheetah support ... .
which missing codecs ?
does that mean they get 5 points ?
still fighting with that pam_kwallet problem
no it doesnt work
i am about !
still wont work
so read the docs and get a clue .
if you have access to 15.04 board can you create a task for this ? it is a good idea
what ip is it bound to ? an address that 's routable on the network or a localhost address ?
at least that 's the spec , i 'm looking forward to getting the client to try it out
that should disable the power savings feature of your monitor so that it wo n't go off after a while

this change , it 's a source package only change
it is set
totally not something you wan na start near eod
yup
and did you tweak apache 's worker # ?
then there has to be a dependency to make sure that the last charm did the right configuration ?

i dont have that hardware.. but , you can always look for someone with it , in # ubuntu for

we agreed that for docs , the team would only update from the 15.04 series and that trunk would roll
hmm they must not do humour over there

have time today for me to bug you with a few notes on things ?
ok , i 'll retry with a phone later and see , any hint on what should be there and
without write-mostly , all i/o , also reads , will be spread to all drives
how i can upgrade to 14.04

one is installing a command which 'pastebins ' , the other is pastebinning whether you have any packages installed with
how would i check that
evo i did on friday , what is still needed ?
ok
so what if the image was a lot smaller ?
and what are the last entries in the messages logfile before the server get killed and the reboot is logged
can be it a problem related to gcc 5 ?
i googled for ubuntu and your si3512 and only got posts from years ago
if you are not able to boot into your pc , like you always would ( not from live cd
in the next version of juju
i 'm pretty confident it should n't be below 5s
i 've just tried using kate with a fish connection and it seems to be working fine
well , if you 'd build both , you 'd have two packages with new contents but neither would have
ah , yeah i 'd definitely try wine first , than us a vm guest on a unix host
it seems that 's all under the same license as the radeon firmware we already have , so i see
try without debug symbols first , but it will probably not show much
well then you have some other problem
plan is that packages from the ppa are synced to wily . however , i ca n't say how reliable
heh , that might do it . i remembering doing this on my other pc
frobware : dialling in
what system is that at all ?
yes , but your account has a limit afaik
you 'd need an ssh server installed on it . easy enough to do
id like to but i thought i have to solve it on its own
great !
maybe the # i3 guys might know ?
and 2.7 ?
yeah , all 3 of them .
ok , logout and login using the guest account
yes , that is what i try to find out . if he did not install a driver its using
heh , so two things can cause this , the merge causes lint errors ( unlikely ) or your lint
yep , i fixed that : )
i 'm trying to set agent-metadata-url after the secret key
symlink in another location onthe path pointing to the old version ? a locate doesnt find it nor does a
cool , another reboot and fresh /var/log/xorg.0.log please
from my notes : - > instructions for upgrading aree buried in it 's readme file . - > nvidia-installer
you should always use sudo umount /mountpoint to unmount it
and then you get a translations entry in the json
this is the facts
time to dive into the logs
what does image2lcd ?
lang is set to german , despite that i have no single configuration where i chose german
even better
oh okay yeah i sea
wow , looks good.. i guess my brother probably does n't need his pc anymore
hmm , i -was- cheating a bit and just using the sources.debian.net archive ...
no , i would say file it against kubuntu-meta and send a mail to the ml , maybe the others
yeah - the method i presume ?
anything specific you want me to try ?
it 's a perfectly cromulent way to install flash
please run a `` sudo apt update & & sudo apt full-upgrade ''
did you create the pv or vg ?
both of them do : (
hey you asked when it shows up ; )
sometimes it also firewall issue . both machines hogging the same router port . disable all fire walls on router
popey probably has a copy of your kids photos on his web server : )
alright , silo 1 can be published now
normally grub should not show every boot , but probably yes
how does that ip address get assigned ? dhcp or manually ?
reading through that mail i get the impression that rc-proposed is fine ... and that 's where the silo is
is that the guy tj- helped with all his ssd 's ?
lots of problems with rc3
2 years later : )
i thought my big 290 gig one would have more swap space , no ?
well , 1.5.1 in wily is slightly faster fwiw
but it might be useful as knowledge for the future to know if that is the cause
that 's exactly what i mean
on linux systems you are using the packet manager to install software , in ubuntu this is apt , so
it 's ok you do n't have to call me `` bro ``
sure , i agree . i do n't think this is a complex case - i guess we have different
that still results in the shutdown wallpaper being the same as the boot wallpaper .
oh , what did sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt return ?
apt-cc conflicts with aptdaemon
we have three bogs now ... 1314382 1404030 and 1441594
how do i change that ?
the next lts is 16.04
no
you up to date ?
open a terminal and do : sudo apt update & & sudo apt upgrade , then we can check the
that 's bad ! just trying to learn and thought webmin would be good as i 'm used to cpanel
ok , so you broke it . 'disk a ' is smaller than the original 'disk c ' . you
i just had access to guest session , with all programs installed , but not my user profile
just the nameserver
ask the # vbox channel for support with vbox issues
ah ok then lol
that should be good start for me , a little help is still good to try
does it work now ?
oh btw , did you have any more people work on the new plasma packages ? ci is severely red
if those are just no-change rebuilds , maybe rsalveti can handle that ?
sure
the one thing that looked strange was
where ?
nope
key events should also go to non-focused items ...
and , of course , at that point , output == proposed ( does n't it ? ) , so
no
ah , so you mean that one has to rebase on top of the other so that both can go
+1 on holding back 13
maybe compiz will work better as it was more intended to be used stand alone , but then it is
i believe is gparted ? no ?
also add lightdm at the end
is the printer connected to your network ?
no , sorry not that one
we appreciate you : )
every app that use to check opengl say me that i have mesa driver , i ca n't even run
ok , updated the mr , if you could later top-approve it it would be awesome
for s3 , everything but the auth itself , yeah , but not in general
use dist-upgrade instead of upgrade , as the messages on the screen tell you : )
i.e . is n't that strictly worse than before ?
pat uploaded the .crash file , /me uploads to lp , hopefully the retrace there will be more interesting
do we know where it is trying to copy too ?
imo the value of a tracking system would be 100 % persistency so i 'd actually dump raw data into
ignore what i said earlier
ubuntu desktop ? no other flavor ?
good idea , yeah
so it should not depend on ecm ?
you are aware that 15.04 is not `` production '' grade os - it 's pretty much a technology preview
then what
i had one of those accidentally double-clicked assigned entries in bileto which i wanted to abandon . but no prob
it was making it a pain in the rear just to install vmware-tools
i can save you time , because you know he is .
sudo apt-get -f install | pastebinit might fix
not yet , next year ill start
it checks the charm if there 's a `` lint '' target
go with staging-whatsitcalled
drop to tty1 , issue `` sudo service lightdm stop '' - run `` sudo modprobe nouveau '' then start
try otherwise there are issue with formats or setregion code
then we need input from osomon and/or alex-abreu
dist-upgrade wont take them all to 14.04 ?
all over hal ?
what ubuntu version ?
right ( pidof stuff still ? )
anything in /var/crash ?
hmm
ip r d 192.0.0.0/8
+1 on it working and not torpedoing : )
did you get me that /lib/firmware/ listing ? i do n't see it in the backtrace
locate libflashplayer.so
you mean a service as in a file in /etc/init or /etc/init.d or something else ?
`` sudo apt-get install dkms ''
was that something we could change in a code branch or did that require special access ?
show the current full output since the last command , these little bits and pieces are useless .
they do n't seem to be able to answer my question : / all i wan na know for now
i 'm not against proper error handling , i 'm disputing the default .
ok
you self-identify as `` zleap ''
yes i have the latest drivers installed .
glad i could help and ya got it working . stay safe : )
nope that 's still wrong : (
1- i enter the setup window by pressing f9 - > enter setup 2- usb has higher boot priority
christownsend
yes , dual boot ( sorry having been unclear )
you can try gnome , but i fear you 'll never go back to unity ; )
nah , hollywood accounting is different . game publishers do n't want losses on paper
presumably actually `` 0002 '' ?
dude . try it
got it
did you try an update-grub ?
what does `` dpkg -l nagios '' tell you ?
as long as the two ( wily and v+o ) changes land in sync , we 're fine
they depend on that package . but not on that exact ( wrong ) version
are you using `` shred -- remove ... '' ?
i tried install burg last night ( the grub themer ) , but it killed grub lol
this bug is present in 14.04 too , this is happening with my laptop , when the battery is running
my best guess is that its either an outdated package manager
interesting , that may be an error from connecting to the mysql daemon . add more debugging around the connect
yep
i want compile clips 3.6
i can investigate this one , i was meaning to let people know i was doing so
i just used your command `` snapcraft all -- force '' , it seems to be right . i am
i suppose he could try that ...
i just removed the drivers , now it boots fine : d
open the dash and type amd
we do n't do hacking here . check your channel .
ohhh
there is no spanish for mint all language are supported in one channel
`` state does not implement server.state ( wrong type for unitprocesses method ) ''
recently i 've been wanting to find the envuuid from juju via the command line - i do n't think
also there might be a button you can press to get boot options when the pc starts , and choose
indeed ... my radio was outdated ... updated , lets see if it 's better
cuz you are best in here now ; d
laney is up , let 's give him a moment and then we 'll come bacl
perhaps show the output of a basic `` sudo apt-get update '' and `` sudo apt-get install pastebinit ''
ah . see little details like that are helpful to have ... up front !
no
have you checked it for speed ?
bios update , not chipset
not necessarily , no
i would stop at this point and try to create the fs with gparted
i am not surprised , charging and using the machine gives vary result .
has happened to me twice , but i have n't explored further
joining
with nouveau drivers
`` pastebinit < ( lspci -nnk ) ''
try to remove your u1 account and re-add it
so it is not possible ?
so it is very very inconvenient to work w/ , ... so the only option there was to play w/
ok , cool . it looks pretty easy , except perhaps how to add the extra jenkins job
run make again .
so im confused why reboot required
do n't overdo it
it uses tmpdir as defined in launchpad.net/snappy/snappy
ok , type ls -l /boot/efi/efi/boot
ah , should i ping tyhicks in the future about security updates ?
not yet , doing that now
then boot using normal or eufi ?
so again - you just want your root file system
do you think you could remove windows and install ubuntu to one of those ? instead of getting the ubuntu
right , so it 's snappy itself that handles it
removing all doubt of the legacy install that you screwed up
is this a bios based or uefi based machine ?
i did that already too : )
my thoughts on that are no ...
try mv ~/.config ~/.config.old
he 's supporting the hackathon tomorrow
that 's clearly not the right rule of thumb for high-mem systems , but that means we should fix the
no `` eye candy ''
thx
dc and ad are services for windows and in some cases for unix
can assign to you ?
so its a little unclear where that version came from.. i 'd guess from a ppa , i 'm suggesting
the rules are ok. are you sure they are in effect ?
try a different usb
coverity scan is free and superior to cppcheck anyday , but it has big limitations to the number of times
how would they know what os you 're using
oh sound okay i 'll just write up a bug then
ahhh , so it went missing
i have n't worked on the sections bugs yet : ( and i 'm on holidays from next week
wo n't i have to get to the working directory on the device ?
oh there you go , 26
try a proper ftp client then
unless you know how to pull some strings : )
could you tell me how to copy and check with rsync ? p
i burned an iso , and installed instead of `` try ubuntu before installing ''
see you got it wrong
yep - makes sense
imho that is just going worse
he 's been around still
an indicator is supposed to show up
however dns , gateway and all must be manually set too
and yes we 'll add the small patch to qtmultimedia for removeitems ( ) ... let me know when you
agree that we should only have one product name
ill take a look
ok .
interesting , give me a few minutes to make sense of whats going on there lol
what is the native resolution you are looking for ?
ubuntu 's default installation and repositories do not include packages needed to play commercial dvds for legal reasons . for
yeah , that 's why i delayed my run for at least another hour : p
please do n't do that here either
while that might be nice , it 'll also introduce further maintenance issues than what we have . i 'm
correct
please see above
also ; when i run sudo gparted about 5-10 minutes ago ; it still shows `` scanning all devices ''
not devel-proposed , no
so , first advice is finding all ubuntushapes and update them to the new apis
great .
not extreme either .
that article was the starting point of my queries
it works ?
is it a hp or toshiba laptop ?
where do you see that ?
sturmflut2 : somehow my latest dist-upgrade completely messed up the clock for my laptop
just a sec
dmesg | less
for example , xauth list
your silo is in a broken state and needs to be completely rebuilt . however you got those packages into
why not ? and who is `` we '' ?
pulseaudio has a proplist for card , right ?
use another controller and disks ! ! !
do we have to ?
ok , cat /proc/asound/cards ..pastebin the output pls
yes , as i said
but mostly , he got you everything you need right ?
?
that sounds like a good idea
perhaps you know this , i have a .c file that needs compiled , it 's just a wrapper for
alright , will do
you beat me to it . : )
sil2100 : i have a new card for silo 28 , was that a mistake ? in the dashboard ,
oh and what is your favourite programming language ?
i never researched more about that drm-stuff , but for example , my dvb-s2/c2 recivers an handle recording the streams
for some reason it 's only seeing the roaming network and trying to connect to that , which is of
okay , lets wait for tony 's feedback . meanwhile we are testing the silo as it is .
even shutdown in console mode doesnt work . i booted the live cd with text mode and went into console
)
ahh , debug-hooks only works if the hook is in an error state ... this is usually easy to do
you could add a xev command to the while true command and see if the buttons were pressed for it
i assume you have n't messed with your audio configuration , right ?
updated time will be shown , but it 's not implemented yet
yes , nouveau is the default for the nvidia gpu
oh ok , it says it uses the launchpad primary e-mail .
is it open ?
it is n't in the next phone ?
apt-get update , apt-get upgrade ?
hmm , i might be wrong ... seems to not work on krillin
you did not push then
kill -cont
yeah , looks like your text strings are corrupted as well : )
in essence amiant-mate and radiant-mate are 99 % of ambiance and radiance . just with green hinting and full colour
who 's a good person to ping . i have a bug which they should be screaming about
well that 's much simpler . sigh . so stupid
extra is everything non core os - i.e xorg/firefox/desktops , etc ... .
is there any way to filter out papercuts that already have a branch pushed ?
the arm devices need special handling because we cant install the generic ubuntu.iso on it . so its # ubuntu-arm
hah : )
that has gui ?
i 'll refresh the metapackage and upload it once it 's merged : )
misunderstanding detected
that was thrown out weeks ago : )
i understand but it 's not as formally distinct a distro like those others
yes !
yes it does
ah , right now its -a always , exit -f arch=b64 -s creat -s open -s openat -s truncate -f
hello
so remember , a good workperson never blames their tools .
fair enough but please do n't hint at illegal activity in future
it appears to be for simple input devices , if no other input devices ( keyboards , mice ) are
yeah i was actually just about to ask you about battery-life and trackpad drivers .
wfm ; this is easier to change in an sru than conffiles
i see , well - as long as the device is registered and maas can clean it up with its
probably not this week , there 's a lot of stuff in that thread for mitre to catch up on
but that needs fixing too
anything in ~/.xsession-errors ?
for oxide-qt in phones getpkgsrc does n't have enough space
`sudo apt-get -y install pastebinit ; sudo apt-get upgrade | pastebinit`
oh sure , once the db is broken it 'll be broken i guess
that means it 's working
well the remove machine is just a server so does n't have a browser etc ... i 'm just ssh-in
nice : )
notice that you might need sponsoring : p
i 'm afraid you have to define the ui in code . at least qml makes it easy
in publishing maybe ?
yes
if you set them in your router and you ca n't acces it you have to reset your router
odd , but glad it got solved , i guess .
you get that error message if you try to configure something that 's already configured . eg : `` dpkg
were n't you in that program to test whether the interval between donations could be reduced ?
no.. touchpads are both touchpads and pointers
was it just that ?
sync monitor is not sync contact anymore
ultimately , when we have the window management code for desktop , we might allow some of that working on
i read it but i do n't see my error . i will try being explicit ( -- version )
`` pastebinit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf ''
is there any files in /etc/apache2/conf-enabled ?
and the other 2 against you ?
whats left to do then ?
why is it insecure ?
looks good
oh nice
i 'm suspecting something more autopilot introspection related
then , on the remaining line replace the uuid= ... .. part with `` uuid=f4ef6653-b73b-45e4-9446-fedda6aca2e1 ''
agreed . i wonder who stuck our part of the world into the freezer ...
let me finish some business here first to allow me to reboot the machine
and grow / to the left to absorb it
can i shut down the ec2 now ? my credit card has only so much credit : )
revert to seding the version field
put this `` @ compton -b & ''
i have them for the ubuntu branch only , smooser 's uploads , and then , mind
fyi the error you indicated is n't really openstack specific , in that the bootstrap has to happen before any
would it be easiest to get this in a silo early ?
i will try and do that now , however i have tried recovery mode already , to no avail
nod
cool
yes .
great man ioria got ya going man : )
eek , no i totally got distracted by that launchpad request thing , can i have another link ?
you didnt , scroll up
yes , will test tomorrow
he 's got screen tearing on web videos
because ?
although it is also true that dropbox is a little weird . its package installs a helper app , and
indeed !
if you fixed the issue you can not have deleted the ubuntu partition/file-system
it was hidden in plain sight : p
that 's what it claims , a version string problem
yeah , never can tell where ya might pick up a nice tid-bit . it all adds to the store
not easily , you may be able to black list the problematic shares in tracker-perferences
see the link : )
so you have a disc ? try booting with it , eg . putting the disc in the drive and
well aware of that
ahhh take off the underscore
tried what ? and what failed ? how ? did you try asking in # ubuntu ?
you mean , creating the temp user , autologin and such ?
then you can edit the kernel command line
what was the date we first saw this problem in recent times ?
so i 'm added some tests and hopefully that will point me to the problem : )
the lebanon h4cker
lsmod i 'd guess
define do not load
ask directly and dont ask to ask ! ask
eg sudo vi /etc/ ... /configfile
yes
i just did a search for some keywords in your question .
ask again when there is someone from the sru team here , i.e . on monday
if you followed the guide and installed phablet-tools everything should be good to go ...
what is `` path '' and how do i add that ?
i keep telling you this ! the device must be connected
also then can export it back to pdf again too
why are they not missing on my install ?
i 've added an `` undefined '' type on the qml bindings to allow for the check , but i
mostly
`` sudo apt-get remove unity '' then `` sudo apt-get autoremove ''
there is nothing he needs here more than a simple working tftpd install . when tftpd is working , if
if this has to wait until you get your device back , so be it .
be aware if you just call 'echo ' using `` echo '' you may be invoking the shell 's implementation
it needs to be a map
that 's a bit harder as the code that reports that does n't have knowledge of the packaging , only
have you this already packaged and installed ?
i have n't tried yet , i just remembered having to ping someone for something last time i did this
ignore it please
after that , restart
ok , so it 's a package copy , simply , right ?
is it really useful to display all of that in irc ?
i run dual boot with windows 8.1.. most of the time i sit in ubuntu cuz you get to do
i could n't figure out how to do it through the kmix
so my understanding is that secure channel is laptop - > my.ubuntu.com + snappy device - > my.ubuntu.com ; either
yes , they are all there
check a hardware compatibility list
non standard hardware , do you think intel hd5500 is non standard , ? . no dedicated graphic card installed
and i do n't knkow what you mean by `` pure '' here either
anche !
right , that 's due to ^
ok , check if grub-efi is there
lol , ruh roh
and every team is responsible of moving their records
i do not have problems with my .install files the problem will start with symbol files
i used to work fine if there were n't many applications open . after i expanded swap from 2.5gb to
whats your issue with our performance , also on which device ?
no experience ...
with the installer gparted ?
there may be notest about this in /usr/share/doc/posggresql*
i dont mind using unencrypted swap . but there appears no swap space in my partition table of hdd now
sorry
and we do n't have 1.21 and 1.22 in the versions file
im pretty sure its the nvidia 346.47 driver thats the problem .
and as `` upstream '' i 'll talk to `` linuxcontainers '' project to possibly include libnih/libnih org into their
add it to /etc/default/grub and update-grub
ok restart apparmor then
depends on your eye and preferences . personally , i prefer a clean , non-serif font > > > ubuntu
no , that 's not your job ; )
ovidiu-florin hello
ok , i probably can do if it 's simple
did you teach your friend how to use launchpad to file bug reports ?
was udisks fixed ? by what change ?
you ca n't .
`` yeah , but at least it writes in ~/.cache/*unity8*/ , not in ~/.cache/ directly ; ) ''
emulator
great : )
from those you can then reinstall any that you 've deleted files from with `` sudo apt-get -- reinstall install
if we knew the path we can do `` cat /usr/share/applications/spotify.desktop '' and we would see the command it executes
we should have the channel finalized soon , which means we 'll be able to build a new image with
also juju_repository , i assume that is pointing to your charm ?
less/sass is all about easier maintenance ant shorten modificaton time
that 's what i use
inside the source directory run debuild -s
any input ?
yeah , i was looking at the bad commit not the fix
it is still not working .
oh look at that , it is as if you found this minutes ago : -p
well then -- off you go
well , i do n't remember why it was useful , but in fact it 's ok , upstream sort
i have the unity/ubuntu add-ons enabled in firefox . i thought that may have been the problem , but its
for lfnw
start from command line , observe errors
not done it in 15.04 , so can not aptly advise .
did you get my reply about continuum ?
it 'd have to be proposed as a pull-request to our ofono git tree , accepted/merged , and landed in
and a .deb does a lot more than just `` unpacking '' . : p
do you have the access to ssh ?
before opening an upstream report , i collected the info described to the ubuntu wiki page
so what should we do now ?
oh , right , i fixed that on my setup by patching the line 207 in /usr/bin/phablet-click-test-setup to just use
so if it 's nil ...
is start terminal
no it can wait till its fixed
and as im sure you know , this is doing something to my kernal img and /boot
there are isps who on bt equipment make the voice separate ; bt charge them separately
also , if/when you get a chance ptal at the resources pr again : - )
i know you used to go by vortexia
wait . no unused space ? do n't you mean used space ?
in machine 1 lo , i see a 3 minute gap fetching tools
any sda or sdb is the hd not a partition
are you thinking of a hack ? ; - )
im talking about 13.04
you 're about where i 'm at , then . ; - )
sorry , thinko on my part
do you have a clue as to why desktop version doesnt work but alternate does
np ; we 've all been there : )
you can try.. or autoremove.. sudo apt-get autoremove kubuntu-desktop
i 'm just the snapcraft software guy now ; - )
is ctrl-alt-f2
you are aware you are making a full desktop os isntall there ? i would recommend you make it more
exactly what i 'm working on . we need an upgrade step to move the config files from the old
the reason i wanted to add info on this bug is because this xorg crash triggers a relogin without the
cool ! is there a bug about that ?
could you push directly to trunk a commit with the debian/changelog ?
thats not what torrent sw does
no , i only popped in whilst drinking a coffee : )
if it 's fairly straightforward , would n't hurt
thx
alright , will give it a try
no , the command is called dpkg-reconfigure
dpkg-source : error : unwanted binary file : debian/cmakefiles
that was me ( among others ) , i just confused you with someone else
yea you 'd think it would spit out the module it was trying to load . but it says could
what does that mean ?
bonobo was gnome 's ole-alike
sudo ./make_img.sh -b raspi2 -d 15.10
we never had auto-registration
yes , the whole idea of ota-8.5 is to release a few important fixes before the end-of-year holidays
both are usb , yes
sounds good to me - can be a seperate branch
is there a kernel fix ?
start by reading the resolvconf man page .
but there 's upstart-bridge , is n't there
jordan_u : gon na give xinitrc a whirl
so it is dependent on this that this functionality is not available .
yes , that is the problem we are tacking
run that . no effect
the key line in the # 12 post is `` -session optional pam_systemd.so ''
i noticed in strace that you are running 32-bits ( i386 ) , perhaps that could be significant ( or

the first command returns an error
heh grub legacy , you are using grub 2 commands
what errors , what exactly did you try
i had both ppas , backports seems ok , kubuntu-ppa says not found
xbacklight -get
ok , so presumably we want something like validtargetdefault ?
i should save that
try dmesg and /var/log/kern.log

the issue started at the same when a scheduled backup was started on the machine
created a query with you
are you hitting it from a machine inside eu-central-1 ?
even when windows is powered down , not in hibernate ?
that is what i was asking before ... ask bfiller : )
indeed
krillin ota4 + notes update
then md5sum /dev/sdx what ever your usb is .
yes
try sudo apt-get install btrfs-tools
the deletion must be handled by you guys

even tiny reviews ( like general direction looks valid ) are useful . or your suggestion to use the version-compare
ubuntu version and grafix chipset + driver loaded ?
look on the panel for `` settings ''
it affects 14.04.3 too - you have the updated kernel and xorg stack
ok , good
the keyboard backlight really depends on what keyboard that is .
sddm/nvidia-prime work seems to be still on going
oh : d
we 're not fixing anything , we just say we do n't support de-facto standards today
someone will be looking at it shortly , i 'm sure chris can follow up when he comes online
sure .
yeah interviewing people
there 's a ton of paperwork , but that 's what lawyers are for . i paid ~ $ 500
ok i marked it as ready for qa

nope , on .config/autostart there is nothing related to those apps

i did n't know that ; i 'll tell the user next time they pop up : )
what would be the way forward to get a doc package built , though ? that would allow us to
i couldnt get an answer from there .
cool
i prefer to understand why it fails , not find a shortcut to fix jenkins
oh you did those already , sweet
in # ubuntu-it we have found an user called 'ubot9 '
so an unrelated , and still reproducible problem ... the initramfs complains about `` target filesystem does n't have requested
the other thing is to make sure you do `` godeps '' and all that , just in case there
why are you looking at the exo repository to begin with ?
free command shows the amount of swap space you have
you will have to use zita-a2j for both mics
nope - neutron-api will trample all over the gateway charms config files
the : : next is to remove the headers .
depends on how you installed your software .
where i can post any forum ?
i will follow up in our standup
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
try gparted ( partition editor )
is n't it getbrowsercommand ( ... ) ?
any changes when you plugin adapter ?
let me know if you need anything from me , happy to help however i can
because comparing pointers was n't useful : - ) basically , we were comparing two lists of pointers and reflect.deepequal

for inside restoring you can use aptoncd to backup your fav packages
unless you use mutt ...
and its that 3rd party packages that have bad depencies . so there is nothing ubuntu can do . talk
you are using lightdm , are n't you ?
okie dokie . thx .
did n't seem to resolve anything as iam still stuck at 1280 x 800
it sounds like an opengl anomaly .
where are you sending the pipe ?
if you do n't mind summing it up again , what are you trying to do there ?
hwraid can be fine on the boot medium , since it outrules problems with boot sectors
he is a au timezone , so usually appears a different times to us eu/us folks
although how did it die ?
looks pretty easy to use though really
does the block device actually have backslashes in the name ?
so when touching nothing , your laptop 's mouse pointer on-screen is dancing around ?
we should start thinking the installer slideshow content and looks some day
i 've used this a bunch of times with raspbian images for a raspberry pi or ubuntu startup disks ,
i got 4 boot options , selecting anyone of them results in same error message
i had to charge mine for an hour or so
xfce4-panel patch is upstream btw , so i hope translations for it land soon
i was thinking it 'd be a property of the resource type . is that conflating ?
24/7 things always hold a security risk
did you upgrade to 15.10 from 15.04 ?
if hello-world works , thats probably good enough
err , so what are you doing here ... : )
but right now the apps are n't confied at all
no , we use aosp
oh , was it xmir in the video ? ^
open a terminal . sudo apt-get install pastebinit < enter >
is there any sound coming at all ? through speakers ?
pastebin.com/3nsqyyx5
we can figure that out at machine-creation time , ca n't we ? when we 've already got the state
so google with baidu on the picture would not yield any desire result
this suggests the original `` for n in ... '' may not have fully worked .
drop the attitude
will try that next
i used automatic partitioning
when dvd drives got cheap , they got particularly unreliable . i have one dead one in my tower ,
kk i 'll go from there , recommend to make boot usb from inside live cd or just with tool
does `gimp` in the terminal launch the app ?
probably just xmir-dri2.c bugging , does it show when you run xmir with -egl too ?
yes
go ask the chromium/chrome team .
fair enough , i 'll do that now
have you used any othe network analysers ?
how was it you asked to be dropped into initrd ?
ok from what part
so , that 's something you can do in the gui , which allows you to modify placement before execution
but what you 're referring , is not a `` terminal '' option per se , so much as an
yes and no
sure .
any more ideas ? : d i 'm a bit lost here..
that 's not a acceptance criteria for this particular bug , though .
if not , set it up , then in it do `` sudo apt-get -- reinstall install bluez ''
aaaah humbug !
: )
my client needs it in 2 tho
not going to support your box with webmin on , sorry
/msg name
nope , this is non-native .
reviewed
so for example with signon-apparmor-extension in place like on image 210 photos login for facebook and instagram fail even though
and this means ?
just kidding
ping
only when we click an item
say going from the most recent stock patch on 3.2 to a previous one , i 'm thinking more general
or are you on a 32bit system ?
network access , writing env vars , etc etc
i only just fixed that failure you reported . any ci jobs started in the past few hours will fail
do you have windows ?
ok you must have a lot of non direct family relatives then or something
ok thx
those package was installed
you have to add a special flag
ok
^ ^ ^
right
^
that 's in 1.21 ?
invited you on github
i would lose the cleanups i did on the tests . i did n't added new tests . i split
unity8-desktop-session-mir
yes . there are some very wrong howtos and `` tips '' which suggest to just change the permissions to
all my aps were free , i can reinstall them .
no one is there yo
but we are indeed crippled
can you find any logs with error ?
i already answered you twice what your options are
no snooze button or ok button..but a notifications like any other timer app in other platforms show
no , sorry
^^ can you look at that ? i 'm wondering why those failures are happening
what makes you raise the question ? what particular error ( s ) are you getting ?
thx , sorry for changing things around on you : )
okay . i just switch the job to be hp .
i have n't gotten that to work it says not found
yes , in the pptp options enable mppe
possible guarded with a [ -f ] if paranoid .
you mean since before ?
we have no way of knowing
try sudo apt-get install fglrx , maybe
is that it ?
should look the same ( modulo code update , of course ) as the orig.tar.gz in the archive for 0.4.8
everything
yup think it is , just to confirm : - )
this isnt the channel for jokes , plz ubuntu support only
yes , but it doesnt seem to have a link for vivid ?
basically this is a giant hack and totally unsupported by any infra . but the spreadsheet replacement will come soon
it 's written in the node list page , it 's a collumn . what does it say for this
anyway do n't think about it now : )
glances can be used for remote monitoring too ?
if so tell me the full command you used . i am guessing you might have reinstalled libgphoto2-2 instead of
ok tnx here i go
.
right , you gave the vivid ones , which look fine ; i meant the failing wily status output
^
see his paste . there is not an issue which will need killing dpkg
# freenode
huh yourself
k , but should hacking a different partition size should be enough to write the image ? do you know
yes - the ceph pool is aligned to the service name - so
weird
ok , well ubuntu seems to be installed in legacy mode , and you 're using a msdos partition table
when you installed both in uefi mode , only ubuntu booted ?
: p
which is absurd i suppose
paste the output to paste , ubuntu.com
shift+ctrl+c copies previously highlighted text in gnome-terminal

ubuntu has no root acccount .

you can type @ reviewlist now at any given moment and save yourself from copy paste ; - )
awesome !
someone just noted the security issue in the comments of that bug .
can you press f6 perhaps ? to get a little menu to pop up
all tests pass - both make check and the live ones i 've described
in this instance we have tried it and failed with jean . i use systemd.unit=rescue.target to get to a terminal

hope you 're feeling better soon
ah , -touch works for me as well
i 'm downgrading by 1 version to confirm it worked on previous
well then that branch must be useless so
my wireless keyboard is literally next to it
yes
what kind of issues
i wrote a python script following the pattern set by some of the other tests , like assess_bootstrap.py
apr-get ?
i have the same problem in i-sound , please wait with merging that second one
it 's building because i forced it .
so i 'm doing `` further investigations ''
is that better to use than the bzr method ochosi pointed at ?
no that 's it
when in would be as update in repository ? when status of bug report will cchange to closed ?

the plasma 5.5 package is n't ready for kubuntu , but it should be in the backports in a few
yes if your device is vivid you 'll get the vivid packages , if your device is wily you 'll

after gparted completes the changes , remove the usb and plug it back in
snapcraft creates a wrapper script which sets the ld paths
and the ip of your bootstrap node is 10.16.100.73 ?
well its not a node . its just another device . and no . it is not getting an ip
i did sudo tune2fs -o extent /dev/sda1 now and after rebooting the host i can boot vivid in the vm

you can actually use a created click chroot with other users afterwards - if it 's just the creating that

argh , ok : (
willcooke : hey guys .
sorry im back
oh that was for the feature tour ?
ok..i will continue testing and then see if i hit this after installing the deb package
do you have any other system than the one you 're typing from ? a vps ? a server co-located
i have n't forgotten about you ... just busy ... *sigh*
ok so given ubuntu was n't either ... i should just run boot repair ?
new policy , complaint = air lock - > space .
done , do i try to reboot now ?
ubuntulog will log what you miss by 5pm.. can you please take a look at the log later to see
remote x11 < -- as i said
just in case someone did have /mnt mounted as something else : - )
why ?

i am trying to capture `` component.ondestruction '' , which works on the desktop , but it does not work
by default the boot order is nand > sd
cihelp is not a bot , but a word that will highlight our team
the driver should be pre-installed on the kernel , but if it 's not then that will do it .
on what hdd will be installed grub ?
why ? it 's all on github
even i created a folder in c drive and placed the iso file but it says no such file.. y
ah , okay . agreed that with the way this works putting the picture in memory would be faster ,
hello : )
instead of which one ? unity_mir_socket ?
however with this logging , ca n't reproduce the error
we do n't particularly offer game support here , but do you think your ubuntu system is causing the issue
i knew someone had to of seen this : )
thx
then there is no problem aith your actual xauthority file , what is the permissions on your home directory
i believe so
sorry , looks like `` /var/lib/juju/agents/machine-0.conf ''
ah , that would help ; so i ca n't `` steal '' capacity from buildds then
but hardware questions are offtopic here
a simple snapcraft recipe using only the ubuntu plugin uses dget , which is in devscripts , which is n't
i 've been spending days on that
you could not replicate with another keyboard , meaning that another keyboard worked just fine ?
pressing alt is the same ?
anything but , so as to rule it out of the problem ( i.e . instead of deleting )
apt show packagename
it 's also in startenvworkers
ok so i 'll opt for normal installation and then remove the user and relative home folder ... .
what does it show ?
d'oh ! i always forget to do that when i install ubuntu
and if you keep the keys off your computer , on an encrypted drive , you can specify the key
so it looks like juju tried to add another machine then gave up
what are you typing from right now ?
just configure some activities and change desktops and activities . it does n't matter if you use the mouse or
yes . brb , restarting first , system is nagging me
i 'm looking for some template file or something , inside /etc/maas , to change , but i 'm not
yeah because dbus traffic seems starved
awesome ! : d
common issue
if you need extra space you could mount the ntfs from ubuntu and just use a dir in it maybe
you have a talent for getting some of these inconsitent failures ...
so you get grub now ? and win7 boots ?
ok i 'll try
ok
i guess you were right : - )
stupid me . i had a hunch that it might not work
how ?
did you order a meizu ?
yeah , i have the signal , but no response
: )
same
how can it be obsolete ? we ship phones with it on them : p
try to remove the battery , hold the power button for a few seconds , then put the battery back
no , i did n't test it there ; what fails ?
will search for one at my local store
nothing major , no
what ?
that 's rough
haha : d
the phone is based on vivid right now
yes . but make sure you have `` linux-generic '' installed to get the latest kernel
no , we should be using a type system so that we know the right type of error is returned
can you share the videos with me , i can try to play them locally quickly to get a quick
how regularly ? could it be a cron job ?
in which case it 's not replacing i/os , it is using it as the hypervisor for a linux partition
the only question : `` and introduces a use-after-free bug , fixed with upstream commit ''
ca n't say
ok
yup
yup
so its not lvm enabled
sounds good , so perhaps we can then use extensions to solve other issues we 're facing
since it failed tests on all archs on both releases , i assume it 's not really going to work
np
your protesting against the big top god ?
swap use or swap partition size ... ?
hope it works : )
can you point me at the right people to discuss this with ?
je vais bien , merci !
ffmpeg does most of the things i need , but it 's not exactly a `` video editor ''
a bigger number = newer
oops sorry
latest updates ? what do i have to execute to get such info ?
just to be sure : the build you created fixes a.o . the backup bug , right ?
who is sending the push notifications , your own server , or a 3rd party ?
does the server have an eth0 ?
question ...
also , does the packages from silo 09 sync with silo 17 ?
reboot again : >
15.04
someone had to do this dirty job at some point
no you 're good .
then running kde-nm-connection-editor ( making a launcher for it )
debian an ubuntu packagers seem to dislike consistencym , so often the name of the package , of the daemon
so if you gain confidence , you can also write a docstring for the function : )
if the sp [ ec want us to report stupid shit we can do that
you still have n't explsained what the key is : )
iirc open the dash and just type `` drivers '' and open the application from there
howdy
yeah there 's no technical reason that it could n't be made to work the way you expect , it
ive seen another distro experiment with pepperflash on firefox , but didnt test myself on ubuntu
could you open a bug for this ?
i guess there is lots of action going on , companies are involved with its development
where do i get them ?
a tiny inflation in sources.gz is much better than parsing source packages to generate yet another file .
cool hardware tips will come in handy for me later
checking
actually the other day i realized we were missing 2 patches from the series , could you add them ?
bigron at our lug can tell you about the days they invented the interwebz ; )
it 's nothing usefull , although i didnt have the dbgsyms installed .
the device is dual-band ; the user 's network is only on 2.4ghz

talking with french in ubuntu-fr . a bit easier to me
try : xdg-mime query default image/jpeg
you only removed the empty mountpoint
type sudo parted -l | nc termbin.com 9999
you cant chmod every single file back to the old state . so grab the backups and reinstall and roll
that 's what i 'm thinking
dunno what `` definite name '' means here ... i can chose these frameworks from qtc as they are ,
heh : d
also `` server '' comes up a bit
that 's the entire message . i can get in by advanced options > recovery > resume
now i see that the image is uploaded but it is when the php is trying to create a thumbnail

it 's likely going to cost you money to recover it
ah right , so those autopkgtest failures are because it needs xpathelect to be rebuilt with gcc5 .

that is set for me

good luck , i 'm about to head out and get some sleep . its 3am here : )
tags are meant to be homogeneous ids for the api layer
in response i have added a task to the xx blueprint to try and include normal users - and what
cool , just not an support issue .
that should kill the nvidia blob and take nouveau off blacklist
it was my solution if i do n't found how to fix nitrogen , but it should be better if
that const was there from when it worked in mb
now do `` ping -nc 5 192.168.178.1 ''
mount | grep /dev will display mounted /devices
indeed .
so i guess we need a different `` implementation '' of n-o for that , i. e. not ifup-wait-all-auto.service
so i 'm without hope ?
ah , well i only tries amd64
3 what ?
the global *session* environment , yes
check /var/log/syslog and the wpa_supplicant/network manager messages in particular
probably ? dunno , never tried : )
maybe i misremember
it 's just another `` damn society '' thing
( about silo 23 )
have you updated launchpad ?
for 14.04 the separate package would be superceeded by the module provided in apache2-bin
try `` sudo dmraid -e /dev/mapper/nvidia_afeicaag ''
so do i have a hesitant yes from you for later in the contest ? it runs through janurary ,
i ca n't answer why they are n't but still
yeah , ok. good news is with the event 2.0 qtmir branch , mouse clicks work in xmir windows :
note that you do n't even need a ppa , we keep trusty-backports updated with all xenial uploads
scp
yeah im sure it wont
probably to keep the marketing folks from grabbing flickr `` clip-art '' and using them illegally in marketing materials .
it 's a sync silo trying to sync from silo 27 , but that is already gone
yeah ... i 'm confused : )
we focus on technical ubuntu support in here and dont call names , especially on other distros .
right , the previous ftbfs was due to non-current gnuradio , so it looked worth a retry
dpkg -- configure -a shows nothing
i know that it should , and indeed it does when booting from the blob
yes , i 'm choosing fglrx-updates as my final driver .
oh cool , i 'm just in a meeting at the moment . i 'll take a look after that
congrats on the fix !
and are not escaped
yes , there was a big cleanup some time back
yes
depends on , well , the dependencies , and how old your ubuntu install is .
this seems like a possible upstream related bug : the
but yay , fixed now .
blame systemd or openssl
no problem .
something about firewall blockign passive mode transfers
understood .
i know posix ignores failure in a pipe like that , so it 's fine , but it feels like
that was my fault , ubiquity .24 fixes that
not yet , waiting for some vanguard in uk to wake up
correct
i ; m just trying to help him
yes , that was the crux of the issue iirc
also make sure we know what kernel version we are talking about in the report
i tried adt-run and it works well here . the 404s seem to indicate ports.ubuntu.com is not accesible for you
if you ca n't do that , then go to # ubuntu-kernel and ask them if the standard kernel supports
if you want a user to be able to ineract with it through the terminal , it will not work
ok , seems like the mysql-5.6 package in the repo has an issue , whereas the one in ppa is
do you honestly believe any of this is a useful contribution to the conversations taking place ?
might be better off asking in # ubuntu-mir - kgunn specifically
i have been running it on my ubuntu box for years probably at least 3-4 years now , no dataloss
oh i pushed that to lp : ~openstack-charmers/charms/trusty/openvswitch-odl/trunk this monring
let me know if you need help with building and testing it .
what does it complain about it ? i have no issues with flash when using firefox .
you should ask the pi channel .
you do n't really need much . it depends on what you 'll be adding afterward .
however with the mock clock , it is um ... different

the iso itself is absultely fine
`` sudo apt-get build-dep unity8 '' always gives me the build-deps from stable vivid , missing things that changed in

there is no difference .

you realise you ca n't run a windows .exe on linux without wine right ?
deployment unblocked now
i mean , i 've not enabled it for most channels myself , but ...
in theory you can set different levels for each occasion / status
that should not work because there is no such folder on your system you said
i do n't see anyone else complaining yet ; )
probably both of use merged from trunk , and so we had criss cross
if you compared the right uuid from ntfs blikd , should work
oh actually hang on , there 's a cd you can burn that 's a chainloader that will boot flash
i 'm more amazed this stuff becomes news articles
also , do you know if i `` mir_demo_server -- vt 1 '' from terminal would work ? should it
did you update from any prvious version ?
yeah , i suspect it 'll be fixed when the shell rotation stuff lands , since that handles orientation completely
i see . i 've never changed dns server on linux though .
no , i didnt run bleachbit till after restart
sure
sudo service lightdm restart should do it
when plugged in or plugged when booted ?
i do n't remember exactly . i had an external hdd closure for it at first , which connected to
cg , 'thunderbirds are go ' , looks like it was recorded off itv
weird , i went to another app , and now it does n't get the price back . 1 minute

i am seeing a silo assigned for indicator date time in rtm related to a crash
ack
ok , been there , done that , just glad it was n't arm : - )
i ca n't find a way to reproduce this in the test suite without making the team in question be
suppose xmir is already implemented , that still does n't solve the packaging problem will it ? that is ,
coolz
kbuildsycoca5 , sorry

yeap , thx
oh whoops , that link is the superceded merge
for example - i 've got firefox and thunderbird plugin so those goes to systray when minimized ( i mean
if it 's not systemd , it says upstart . the or will not work without another test .
within 50 mins both dav_mor and ji_bel
best to let the system do what it is designed to do . reset the sym-link correctly and the dns
can i unplug and plug keyboard via ubuntu on my laptop ?
how are you doing ? how are things on the tb ?
sounds like a plan ! may even be able to skip on the dd once you see how successful the
ah that 's a pretty obvious move : )
it is used to make different kinds of installation packages
yeah thats what i tried to tell ya earlier ; it does n't let me boot from usb in uefi
you forgot install
those constraints will be combined with charm-level properties in the former case
i 'm about to call it a week , unsure what 's going on but i can try having a

no , that 's the right , more usual way .
but this is just one message for now ; i will try to send another one and look if dns
no
ah right , must be root-owner . missed that part .
not the speed of the tests running , the amount of work required for an reviewer
uh , where is the what that removes the nvidia driver .
great
just do it in an hour from now , i 'm not going to watch the publisher exactly
btw , the thing with the spelling corrections is : the dbs use stemming algorithms for it . that wo
we 've one autopkgtest regression ( symbols changing ) , fix in archives already by mitya
so i ca n't run it
our geekling showed me a site to learn to program with python using a game to teach you
are you able to use the system right now , and does it have a network connection ?
i mean it 's ftbfs in the buildd servers , when it hit trusty-proposed
im thinking fall for getting this team back on the rails
... are you not able to carry through/investigate any of the options we listed ?
no , never done anything like that .
ok , just add the module name to the file , for example `` ip_tables '' without quotes ?
s/hey ho/hey ( safer this way )
nice ! congrats : )
on my n7 with the xmir binary from your website i can cause a reboot by simply trying to resize
so the new swipe area does n't have scenedistance property just distance , is there any easy way to port
the way bash expanded the *.zip was no beuno
you have to be clearly with no errors communicating with the repos , no dual listings , out of release
are you sure about it ? i read it as grouping all disks into a single mpath0 ?
yes but phpmyadmin is a web app , so it has to run on a web server
not on topic here .
you are safe
correction pushed up
ok .
do you have a swap partition as big as your ram ?
it 'd make your ubuntu system almost immediately unusable , though
do you mind pastebinning a list of themes/icons you have installed ?
try to remove it , you can add it again
i apologize though , i see you were responding to monkeydust , never mind
much better , can actually read it now
should have written more into the description *lol*
i just wanted to test that mirserver branch
what can i help you out with ?
we have al the latest in silo 55 , but it can not land if it breaks music=app
how do i ? metacity -- replace ?
i 've got this ancient macbook that you ca n't even use finger tips on the touchpad with xd you
that sounds like an issue with the program you 're running . are you sure it takes the arguments prefixed
but no , only tried bq
so , thinking about this some more.. it 's somewhat problematic . we 've told the plugin to launch a
right , but then the app will be dead , and the user wo n't know .
it 's a pretty bad issue ... is anyone actively working on it ?
ownership vs permissions
sounds sensible
yes , especially since the changes involved a c++ namespace change for i18n
sounds more like something you 'd wan na use gentoo or arch for tbh
should i add your idea for release parties ?
what should i do next ?
danke
oh really ? i just know it
ahhh , that 's better , a decent log file . i may be lost in it reading for a

yup : - ) but when we land this with the new platform support , it should hopefully all start
unfortunately what you 're suggesting is not sufficient , as it introduces another change into the struct format
ack
done
google `` customize ubuntu installer '' or something . ca n't give you anything more definitive than that , sorry
yes , no differences between clicks and snaps
not really , this only looks for one particular engine , and loads its information from the corresponding xml file

because you touched the changelog , the train basically did not include the commit message of this change in the

ok .
gentle reminder that this is the support channel so please ... chit chat away in # ubuntu-offtopic
you mean if he changed anything : - )
`sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` will grab the kernel updates and other packages held back during 'upgrade ' only
yeah , and for maas - create a device , possibly allocate an ip as well
sry for the ping , i just read the readme and figured that out
ok. what device and release are you using ?
look at bug 1410760
should n't s-c warn about that/prompt through some ui ?
oh ... sorry for silly question . i am laughing to myself right now . : )
read the official faq , as linked
which one ? for the sprint ?
run this : dpgk -l | grep gedit
really ?
wanted an external drive for storing stuff that i could also boot off of

we need software packaged , coding to be coded on , much stuff tested , users to be supported

where do i need the revert ?
run in the ubuntu terminal sudo fdisk -l and pastebin the info
i 'm looking for a complete tutorial . i hate it when you watch 5 videos , you do exactly

ah , i guess i assumed it was doing a for loop and installing each one by one
no , plopkexec works off floppy , too
thats a regression btw
hum , can app names include `` - '' ?
as for gnome , i see ubuntu-desktop-gnome and gnome ( packages ) ...
trunk goes into wily now
hmmm , i 'll look at that
because it 's really mir_event_copy so the performance characteristics
no not yet
maybe something went wrong with your windows
try doing a watch_only build later , it should n't appear anymore as it 's not in the ppa
so , for debugging , is there a logging location or way to query the current state that might give
oerheks , so how can i know if xorg edgers is trustable ; )
not that any of this really explains everything , we 're talking privileged container here , lxc-start is root ,
its still ubuntu ... not kubuntu all defaults are still set and its not using the x11 that kubuntu uses
ok
looking
good idea : )
i had a hard time finding it as well : )
yeh , lets see if that 's the version mine supports
nah , it 's called in bootstrap
you can , but using selenium means you can just look at the html or use devtools
stop it please , only ubuntu support here
rb notices and then updates reviews.vapour.ws and updates github with a link to it .
certainly , one momnent please
( so it will stop when an exception is thrown )
i enable puppet on install .
as you pointed out , obviously unit tests pass
apart from the initdir constant , everything is done on my end , and i would love to finally see

ok , i pulled that branch and checked . it 's my fault . images are in the old version
`` havinagiggle > what burning program does eliot use in mr.robot ? ''
it has ugly ui though : (
maybe a nvidia blob issue then , but 3.14 doesnt hava a problem with same drivers
do you think i could have access to the kernel sources from the newer kernels ( e.g . 3.19 )
sorry exit status
yes you are
well , it 's not available yet , but you could add an action to do this
shortly i 'll have a reminders click for you which fixes the issue you had with text disappearing .
do we know what 's missing ? is it just one function ?
yuo ca n't launch quake from rc.local
thats the first thing kostkon said to do , and you said yes ...
there is an example on that docs page i linked .
what version of ubuntu ?
does it happen when your in the bios screen ?
youve started to pick on me and you 've got response
in /media or /media/user ?
other laptop is also ubuntu ?
details ?
can you be more specific ? iptables has no problem with that
extremely appreciated !
nomodset and nouveau.disable=yes have no effect .
and that just proposed me an upgrade that wiped out here and cut the rope and the bq lenses
disagree . amd specifically ( if belatedly ) supports linux
because it is happening to you ... \
trying to test software that runs on 12.04
what does it matter , we are in fantasy land anyway
nothing much , just making a virutal machine right now . how bout you ?
without breaking ? ? i have some unofiicial ppsa 's as well .
latest trunk , not in store webdm
we 'll do more planning today after the standup .
is the account lost on reboots or on installation ?
he is watching you now ... reading all your messages , i am more technical than him
still trying to wrap my head around it , reproduce in a more isolated way . but for what it
do we have a language thing ?
what does settings manager - > window manager - > style say ?
one issue you said :
even i ca n't upload binaries directly : - )
wwitzel3 : natefinch : if anyone is interested in what i 'm doing , i can pair . some interesting
alt-tab did n't seem to have any effect
i do n't see why not

ah sorry : )
is there a way to trouble shoot it
cool

no actually , you need a postgres install ; p
sweet : - )
the rm 's made it work again ; also i had to generate the ssh host key manually , which

when the source is webbrowser-app it does n't work : no name or icon is loaded
ubuntu is based on debian .
we pass it a list of devices from /dev/sda to /dev/sdz , and the storage charm tries them all
does that work ?
ugh what have they done to windows update =|
just a popular one that i 've seen being used . i 'm sure i could use fastboot and adb
i need php only to execute my python code . else i do n't need php
but i 'm bad at tracking where it is in the pipeline to you
we could set it for both and then you have the option to delete the vivid packages later if you
did you submit translations ?
that 's from 1.7
clean system with bleachbit perhaps
ahh ok ... like it 's possible ... like something loading plugins for example ... .yeah ... .
i 'll give you one guess .
was walking through the packages with ebourg which ones could be synced
k : d
why are you doing startx
it can have the same owner as the ppa you 're presumably already using .
dualboot
restart gparted
sorry about your night
i 've also had good luck with promise sata cards under linux
seems odd that there is database abstraction but you ca n't open a file .
or is it package-by-package ?
i need windows for work , and lubuntu for internet : )

reading through the first one 1504781 certainly describes my symptoms
but the failure to migrate is because of the packages they make uninstallable .
uhm also the display of the keyboard is the same with logitech and nothing more
suggestion : backup your current /etc/apt/sources.list edit the new list per the eoupgrade wiki and test . if it fails
it did take a bit , but i 've done it already : - )
can not infer much out of this . : - (
unfortunately that means you 'll have to ask them how to fix it
i 'm not 100 % sure what it means
that is a lot of fud .
are you all set then ?
correct . proprietary code , and adobe only provides to us the security updates for an old flash version .
oh i suppose . like just for my snap . but i guess i meant , it 's a user
the watch file can deal with letters in the version ?
startssl is still free ; ) unless you want cool stuff like wildcards etc . those are cheaper at other
alright , i 'm going to link you to a page which explains the difference between efi and legacy booting
aaaaand we do n't have a way to target an application to a os release , right ?
i must initialize network connexion in my script ?
uh oh : (
ie . to make sure you 're basing and proposing against the right branch .
did you brew install quickstart ?

lol
that is a sweet set up . are you using raid ? if so which ?

good enough : )
in ubuntu-settings-components
what depmod command do i run once nvidia-304 has been installed ?
i have n't got to the test case yet .

cloud atlas weird or vanilla skies weird
why so many partitions , you still have a whole lot of hp partitions there . they 're normally for
content-hub wo n't effect unity though
now calligra , have you built the source package for me to sign and upload ?
yes , no worries . the goal was for you to learn a little about snapcraft
not that i know of , no
i 'm on the system apps team , working on the phone
so just swap it to lgpl , and put the short form for it in the header , and its
ok
yes i have done it already
`` bzr checkout . ''
go around configurations and look for dhcp settings
what did i miss ? what are y'all talking about ? ? ?
yeah they replaced a builtin microsoft executable with their own at boot time , which is another potential security risk
i can upload gdm , so all you need worry
dimitern : it should probably take as long as this discussion to bring up a machine , create 2 subnets
i do have an internet connection , but usb-creator-gtk does n't seem to like mini.iso
nor me but it saves wasting time does n't it ...
oh , so it did install

do you even read what i write ?
if it 's a windows tablet , it 's probably going to be more difficult to port , at least
i dont know anything about docker , so cant help you with that
if i undo what we have done will it go back to normal ?
ack . time for me to eod too .
i 've tried flgrx and vesa
ah ok
i spent like an hour on that , there 's no effing way to do that : (
any alternative for console ?
ok this is the problem
it is a subclass of qquickitem
i suspect the issue might be due to having 1 nic with 2 aliases all on the same subnet
could this things happens because i did a uefi installation instead ufemi or whatever
oh , needs code changes ?
hola
the ubuntu release team has zero influence over the phone overlay ppa .

for what is worth , we deploy a lot of containers , so disk i/o is intense
if you do n't have a few hours , at least erase the start of the disk , by adding
what 's the version of k3b and growisofs on opensuse ?
yeah , this is 1 of the main reasons i did n't volunteer to work on kubuntu - i was
wow , xming is still around ? cool
yes and i already know it for months and everyone thought i was nuts
`` grep model /proc/cpuinfo ''
okay , ty .
with the fix servers that not available , have vote and want vote now get demoted
best ?
from the usb drive
sure
same
it 's been intentionally missed for years , but no one pulled it from the process page , i guess
erm ... my krillin 's greeter is locked to landscape : )
interesting , it looks like the rsync packagelist file is ok
though i 've used other distributions with plymouth and its worked just fine
ty
k
the relevant change was probably the python rewrite , since it was bloody hard to get the logic right in
i expect you 'll have to loop over the map and use a switch inside to compose the arg list
there 's a syscall in the stdlib , but no sys
the one we ship now looks like it 's from 1998
the installer will put the bootloader on
if you say fastboot and secureboot is disabled , should work
i do n't see any errors in the console logs
were n't you doing digikam ?
it seems we may have lost the top part of your intended paste as well but the missing usb device
ah - right , yeah , whoops .
if there 's a problem that would likely be upstream though
it seems the nodes ca n't access it
well , probably it sees the swapper from the lxc container ( where another init runs that is presented as
not at all
okay
yes , maybe your mirror is out of sync .
did you have same issues on 14.04 ?
its explained there
since nobody has stepped up to merge this , and the delta is a pita with autotools , i am
xenial packages = )
no
this is on the dmz ? why do you care if someone gets in ?
so chrome and pepperflash , not chromium - which do you have ?
seems that / and sauvegardes were not corrupted but swap and home yes .
yes , download 'plop boot ' manager on a cdrom to force load usb ubuntu
i 'm thinking mine does not . i do n't see it listed on the ark page for my processor
never seen a setting to do that in ubuntu
i remember it being awkward to get debug info out of rsyslog ... will see what i can do
it finished
zfs is mainly self-healing
right now i am on unity de and its still doing the same thing ...
can i create a single api struct with two facades
so generally if you `` new '' something take extra care that either you delete it , or something takes
that 's fine . when i wrote the comment i thought the default series precedence was implemented , since you
( or should i just put it right in the wiki page ? )
and you are positive it has linux support ? - for instance ocz revodrive is not possible to get to
give me the file name which lists the alarms
ok will do
right . that makes sense and is my expectation . just unpublish and as dev to fix naming
kvm gives near bare-metal performance .
must have been bumped somewhere , i mean the upstream version did n't match , gles ahead at 0.63 vs
the one error i worry about is g-sense_error_rate = 16550
did you also see them succeeding ? : -d
still there
is the new pulse depending on the new bluez , or could we already push it ?
i figure we can do that when we actually need it
i do n't think so offhand . i hav n't got that branch open but i would have thought wed
yeah
stop .
i take it you do n't 'hangout ' much , then ?
4.04 , though ? well done on inventing a release before warty .
is the only difference between apt-file and apt-cache the debian and ubuntu part ?
while i do n't use grep here , you can see what i mean about why it 's not showing
looking at the ldap bug now
so it 's not the issue i 'm thinking of
do you have particularly egregious examples off the top of your head ?
what is it you are trying to accomplish ?
i saw you 've merged nm-applet . have you been dreaming about that ?
sorry , python3-libapparmor
done
with scrolling down i thought you mean pressing and then moving your finger up
repeat your question here : )
oh ok. yeah that 's why i bought a nvidia card instead of amd .
great- what happens when you open gparted
once installed to disk , i 'm locked at a tiny res
none of the machines will sync mysql
did n't you say you wanted chinese no ?
it 's strange . however , wiki paes seems to be outdated ( pointing to kde-full etc . )
there are also guides on minimal manual installs available , written by devs .
sure , let 's do that just for me to learn the process
is there any hammer i can use on it ?
are you sure thats not the broadcast address ?
are you a canonical employee ?
like having ournihthing.contents wrap response.content ; that 's actively developer hostile .
i 'm not knowledgeable when it comes to updates . try running sudo system-image-cli -v
- you own a beagleboard ?
oh forget that thing , it 's always been buggy
i thought you went for the second because the third did n't work
the latter is pointless as a unit test imo
there you go unblocked
then do `` pastebinit < ( for p in 1 2 3 ; do ls -latr /mnt/sda $ { p
back already ? welcome back !
oh cool , then i can finally reconfig my qt 5.5 silo from vivid to wily too ! i started
my agents are currently running 1.22.8 , if that 's what you meant
still deploying on staging ... .. zzz .
slaap lekker !
or share your issue here in chat ?
stubborn but without the skillset .
too much work to set it up
... that , would help . yes . kind of wondered why it was n't there at one point ,
that 's what i 'm referring too . where does the `` use system proxy settings '' from that tab
yes , drivers
so i run make as normal , then run sudo checkinstall instead of sudo make install ?
sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
merci !
14nm
i thought you had code to hide it ?
ok . so , what can be checked in the phone , the wireless aps ranges ?
helloooo : )
thxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i am ... but then i 'm a snappy dude now : )
37.0
no way . system is complex and huge . this would take to much time
ok like you wish
it is the same
en effet !
i know , but i thought here are maybe more people
sounds like a firmware issue , unless the driver is n't fully supported
yeah
try that fix broken packages option in recoverymode
say they dropped their phone in the toilet . or reflashed . surely these will build up over time ?
mvpn ?
ah so vm . boot live session then use gparted to resize , done .
alright , i actually thought so , it 's just that this channel is linked in the wiki about multitouch
do n't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly ; if nobody knows your answer , nobody will answer you
also , just a note , but the tracks are n't gauranteed to have been added to the tracklist until
it is that i have all my system in english and , therefore , i had installed language-pack-en
boolean
ack , superb , thx : )
no you can not , not without painstakingly matching another install for comparison
should n't it be a dependency of ubuntu-keyboard then ?
it can happen either way . the indicator can get `` stuck '' at a level forever or just for
trying to install buntu
the difference between transmissiond+transmission-remote vs transmission-cli is that the -cli does n't go into the background when your terminal disappears
reviewed
all ntfs partitions are mounted in /media
yes , and i do get your point . that 's why that page is complicated .
how is it going ?
so even in our production it 's icky
that said , this is n't a dependency thing -- it is just that things will still be quite noisy
but i can not see grub and loading page
yep
sure or regular user
can you see access points with the indicator or is it not even showing that ?
wise words indeed : ) see , i have been working with various non tunisian communities ( mainly arabs /international
: ) . i be slow !
i saw you rebuild something , thought you re-built pay-service
i just manually did a `` sudo swapoff -a '' then `` sudo reboot '' and it rebooted instantly !
and this is n't actually something that 's part of that , right ?
research *exactly* what that package is and does.. know how to revert regardless..
given back .
ill take a look this afternoon
it looks like it yeah
just rename , or move , and *keep* the current configs..
windows fanboi . : -p
your comment says `` handle the case where the unit was removed already ''
ok but how in vb can i add it as kernel parameter ?
it already works fine with the open source drivers , minus a few seconds delay before the tty shows up
what does chromium lack ? pdf viewing ?
it 's in the store yes
yeah , something like this
the main issue is filters and do they go into calligra-libs or into the app they 're relevant for
the ppc build in silo 15 is whole done in launchpad which is on separate infrastructure from the jenkins ci
hey , hi
there are three silos
i 'll make sure it gets looked it between today and early next week
for you i made sure to say i would n't undo the change : - )
yeah , says `` attempted to kill init ''
not so much - quite a few stuck instances but it was n't generally apparent to me what had happened
thats no `` root command '' at all .
anyway , try and get the screenshot ; what brand/model of machine ?
which ppa ?
quite well indeed ! mostly worked on the autopkgtest maas stuff yesterday , and some small apport fixes with brian
check your syslog and dmesg perhaps
it is set to 20 max docker builds .
send a mail
i 've got them yesterday
i guess you can try grub4dos if you want
you could see if the devices is listed in dev
i dont use that google-foo much , but go ahead if you want one ; )
check the lines behind driver=
can you reproduce , then press 'c ' to get to a grub shell and then `` echo $ timeout
openvpn support either using tcp / udp on different ports
lol i 'll give it a go since its more than i know about it
i am going to have to 100 % disagree with your statement about 'slow disk swap ' versus some cheap
then use liveusb with persistence , good luck
basically i 'm making a backup of partition a on partition b , hence i 'm copying almost everything
all workers are dead , the machine is out of space
ah . ok
grub has changed a lot since 14.04
server is non-gui so it not so user friendly as desktop right
what is your real issue ?
slickymaster : we 'd better document that : )
you do n't need the exe perm
strange , then it should work as of you were on powersupply
did you try g-c-c ? maybe something is wrong in the ppa then
yeah i just installed all the packages i want into an ordinary ubuntu 15.04 installation and created a setup file
yah - that 's the one
yes that 's what i saw too
they are different languages , one is called python and the other python3 ; - )
`` sudo apt-get install linux-image-lowlatency ''
see if you have /sys/devices/platform/wcnss_wlan , or something like that
why if that 's dynamic ?
hey ! how is weather in vilnus ?
you could also try 15.10 beta
too late : p
free time is the one thing i have in abundance .
i thought i was on vivid
i took today off to celebrate the equinox ( plus i happen to be sick : ( ) you caught
`` still not working with the 06-jun-2015 trusty netboot installer. '' trusty is ubuntu 14.04 .
sudo lshw -c network shows `` *-network unclaimed ''
how can i do that ?
the junk in the middle are splittable
sil2100 and i discussed this . i 'm currently working on landing all of the changes in wily now
well you 're going to need a way to connect both the existing disk and the new disk at the
it 's a perphaps new dependency , which should be added to be linked with .
the only thing i tried to use 15.04 is to work well with my dell inspiron 3443 which was not
that 's different . the chevrolet also involves money .
all i 'm asking is that you make clear what the topic is about : - )
tell me again what you said about the x server . this time it wo n't crash , hopefully .
apt-cache policy linux-generic # in a pastebin please
i pushed a first change , onlyy with style fixes so the branch passes pep8 and pep257 .
on which image did you test it ?
could i write you in private ?
also su as a user would : p
hmm . i wonder if it 's choking on the tar.xz binary blobs
yeah somehow nobody saw my email , there 's still dozens of wily silos in this bad state somehow
are you interested in 1.24.4 or 1.25-alpha1 ?
balloons let me pull up an example
right , but the package changelog ( which is what counts ) has some other message ...
leftover cruft
if you want xfce install xubuntu . done
the security uploads happened yesterday
systemd by default \o/
so after building the binary , and runnig autopilot run test_name works ... however i tried using autopilot3 but it
you guys have put in a ton of hours on this , maybe you actually just made progress ?
so , yesterday i finally gave up and opted for a very simple `` waiting '' solution
do not be angry
that doesnt make any sense when dealing with a vm and a virtual disk file .
hum , in fact it 's working now
have you played around with scribus much ?
houston we have a problem , i 've lost access to the site entirely now
do you need more for migration or is that enough ?
given that they 're both required/essential , it does seem a bit silly , but is it causing harm ?
the original change is already in 3.18 - so i have to fix that anyway
keep the record one at 0 though
great
sorry my stupid quesiton , how to start it ?
never heard of that myself
let me guess.. the keyboard indicator is a client ?
i feel like asus hardware is doing somekind of suspend when lid closes . on top of that , the
please do answer my question .
did you perhaps use 'dd ' to make up a bootable drive but picked the wrong device ?
checked additional drivers section , if other usefull drivers showup ?
i had a feeling : ) but i 've been wrong about that before
it just wo n't be on the critical path for booting
same thing
most folks like to use `` www-data '' , `` web '' ... something that is obvious .
i wait . be aware it is past my session time . my eyes are beginning to cross .
no cursor needed
would the generator print anything in syslog ?
what ubuntu help do you actually need / want ?
okay so i purged all packages related to virtualbox
i 'm a bit unsure about the stuff going into etc/skel and if it could n't conflict with other files
yes , for sure . but my primary question was not answered . what is controlling the mobile connection ?
alternatively i can add them and then *remove* the life field
3.19.0-23
cheers .
crazy , i 've never seen that before .
what laptop do you have ? hp toshiba lenovo acer
notice the `` setting up dnscrypt-proxy ( 1.6.0-3pmo1~vivid ) ... ''
actually , it should be out there now .
i was at work , so yeah . i was asking in order to see if i could learn something
ahh.. yes , that makes sense
hehe , what a coincidence : )
you 'd like to start solving programming puzzles : d
nearly done
so will the test cases refresh ?
we always provision before and start with a fresh environment
but `` can i deploy openstack ( 6 ? 8 ? ) nodes and have juju be ha there
is there only the one ?
i 'll play - scale out is easier .
any case , lower prio than the prompt one
which argument is it ?
i mean i used it on my computer this harddisk with usb port . but then i formated everything and
dpkg -l yajl-tools | grep /bin should list the binaries the package gives
nevermind
we are waiting for a device tarball
it 's been a few years since i 've migrated from windows , honestly . i do n't believe so
the emulator is broken since 2 otas
see the css source for my draft
lets see if there is a simple makefile fix to disable it on i386 in upstream dpdk and let them
did this happen after an upgrade ?
you on the latest image ?
even used standart ( 22 )
i 've solved the issue about autostart file
then you must be patient there , whether it 's # java or # # java or what
what will that do for me ?
yeah , i 'd just nuke the kde desktop file , the regular one works in plasma 5 on vivid
for the record , it has n't been like this in ubuntu since 2009
yeah when you have it in front of you , ping me and maybe we can figure it out
ok but i am unsure how to add the user back in ?
unless i 'm missing something ?
a purist : )
i can ssh into my phone if the container isnt up
i 'm happy for their contribution , just needs a bit of standards compliance
`` cat /etc/issue '' ? ( single line so you can paste here )
that would do it . you can also just log out and log back in , without restarting the vm
do n't trust everything , but for the most part you can
no it took out the internet for me : )
any details on output ?
yep , exactly . switched to chromium and it all went away
are the current steps to deploy an older version documented somewhere ?
i did that , then it magically also applied to the ubuntu config and just started magically working
sounds like it
i should login as root ?
oh , okay . : p
hehehe . hey ! i had a hard time with windows 8+ even getting to the bios ! : d
afaiui we 're running systemd-tmpfiles -- clean once a day
you 're not my dad , you ca n't tell me what to do : p
same thing
so you get a purple screen right now and if you press esc you get a grub > ?
eg i follow some blog or crosllink i see that
cool
but that would make it impossible for me to use the old one if the new one does n't give
but you are entering into packaging and linking in debian/gccgo which is not like golang
what 's left for the translation ? approval in lp then export of the language packs ?
thread apply all
yeah , mkdir will do that with no params
management too
i had to remove them individually
hopefully so !
john-mcaleely said there is a new device tarball for rtm but i do n't see a card for it
do the fans come on ?
nope , but on vgscan i get error messages about the archive file now too
i would follow the instructions , another bug report is not part of the picture , if the same issue
yeah i was a little surprised
try that one again ?
meeting permissions for pieter2627 please
a .tar.gz ?
ddr is ddr ! or ddr ''
if you follow those instructions , you should be able to get gnome 3.16
but from nautilus it fails ?
you can also check /sys/block/ to see if it is a partition
i do n't think so .
sure , will do .
n7
okay now
it 's a test for allspaces
there 's no indication of that in the changelog ( which was the source referenced in the bug ) .
good question ...
wich ubuntu version please ?
now we just need someones order number ; )
exactly ,
or should i ping somebody else about it ?
: d
i 'm hoping that superfly will agree with the latest ubuntu-za merge request asap as well
how is the zfs support on ubuntu
back up and reinstall
i 've created the translations dashboard card , here 's just a suggestion , let me know what you think
done
you ran an installer they made
can i save the state before i do that to keep a trace of the broken configuration ? if it
er , no it 's fine when you use tls ( encryption )
right , got it
you could try to kill the panel process , maybe
i 'd say , next move : add a card to put run_sanity_tests under test . but the only thing
have you been following at all here ?
after that reinstall the packages : sudo apt-get install -- reinstall gnucash gnucash-common gnucash-doc
no , it 's not .
nope
yep
i know so because it 's a windows 8.1 with bing machine you said , which is what results in
it does
you can install go 1.2 side by side with 1.4 and use 1.2 as needed with gccgo ... it 's
it should n't stick on loading modules for more than a split second on any reasonable hardware
restructured text
my only guess is that the contents of the previous assignment for that silo got resurrected when we migrated to
you can share directories with the guest
i 'll add this explanation to api/facadeversions.go for future references :0
is there something i can do in my morning tomorrow about the autopilot failures ?
so then , from what i just read , this should work -- > uuid=1293078mnbndf89 /media/videodrive01 ntfs-3g auto , defaults
no prob , this way the nic holder is notified . ; )
i have no idea . i just remembered the discussion about it , have never used it myself .
( maybe i can then use that same method on me )
should see it wed if all goes well
i have to go ... mom says .
and you probably want -apv
i need it for a potential game a friend of mine has suggested .
somsip just pasted you the link
i 'd do that but need kdbus which seems to only build against 3.19 or later
just a minor hurdle : )
that 's mean ( and impossible )
unity -- version
currently the `` bluetooth pin pairing '' dialog has a full keyboard , which is inconvenient for entering digits ,
so ... considering giving the linux installation another try
you are sailing on dangerous waters .
how do i install it ?
regarding systemd , mate really only uses logind , if it is available .
we 're doing a build.getfileurls ( ) and then iterating over those .
i 've been trying to make sure our blueprints are in a good state . as usual they need love
it 's changed a lot since i worked on it apparently
well explain your issue and see if anyone can help
yeh , i have reboot for reboots i issued .
k , so that was the apt-get version of `` rm -rf * '' ?
irc : //chat.freenode.net/firrre
sure.. it matters , since , you are trying to provice support for it , and the creators of the
what do you hope to get from running the fw ?
maybe we should silently agree to use the first available screenshot_url and use a placeholder if none currently exists
ack
yes
nope
what about `` sudo apt-get install pastebinit '' ?
i tried some ssh scripts for scraping the command output rather than telnet , but never figured out a way
yeah i am slightly regretting not staying with localstorage since afaik there isnt a upgrade db option in u1db which
lsb_release -d
cross-compiling works
i 'm good with whatever you suggest
samecontents panics
sorry i did n't see your ping in private before
up next - kilo-3 !
i have n't changed any options and do n't know why it 's doing whatever it 's doing
well , feature freeze is already past
: )
no clue
ah ? really ?
dude that 's harsh , funny as hell , but harsh ; )
i could explain it in 30 seconds on a whiteboard ; on irc we 'd probably need 30 minutes :
well that sounds like the private key is n't good for the user @ host you 're trying to login
investigate it if you think it 's a bug : )
maybe we should stop doing a distro , and do a news podcast ; )
themue : but please see what you can do : )
codein.withgoogle.com
what is your use case ? there may be better/easier solutions than vnc
is it an external drive ?
exactly those : )
a pivot chroot is probably cleaner than trying to umount everything systematically .
change channel to ubuntu-core/devel-proposed , then reboot , then update
i have a perfectly functioning amd gpu running 2 1080p displays with no problem
well , essential is n't transitive , but required is
except for the usual systemd/coreos rationale of
yeah , it 's `` this triggered > 1.000 tests '' plus one of our clouds got broken again ,
one spot to check , will be - > dpkg -s konversation ; to see if it shows any conflicts
so my suggestion is to do `` sudo system-image-cli -- switch '' on the phone , to switch to the
i was eyeing ansible for that
that is about what mine takes .
less /var/log/apt/history.log
something is very busted on your phone : ( nothing we ca n't fix , i hope , but i
i have no idea how to give it a terminal , but i can search .
no , messaging-app has been rebuilt correctly
no
and i 'm prepping a silo while that 's going on
^
i am unsure about two things with my branch -- does it break any of your existing uses ? and
( or similarly formatted at the cli )
then you might want something more like beowulf rather than openstack . of course , if you 've got mixed
filter all mails from launchpad to trash
use the settings in the terminal to set it as you please
yes , pressing iit if you actually like to go to the home scope is fine ... i rarely use
in the logs , everything is ok ok ( in green ) , only one in yellow and that is
always good ! : - )
if you start ask stupid questions too i do not feel so alone : )
and do n't get me wrong ... i can fix it . i use remove the new kernel and everything
and leave it to run over night
if you uncheck the `` format disk '' option when you reinstall , then all you files and settings should
hmm , odd
ty
do you have a link handy to show the code that generates this ?
it 's mostly because it just takes a hell of a long time to copy all of it , whereas
what version of ubuntu are you running if your kernel is < 3.8 ?
well , sure . see if 'sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ' makes stuff work maybe
i 'm using git-lp that i wrote ( and i 'm using all the time for the past three years
and then clicking on the widget
can you open a bug on that poollistsuite one ? it 'd be nice to get it later
we just mounted it with udisks
sorry about the delay but , hey , i promised it would make the release , and here you are
look into the radeon.audio kernel parameter , or install proprietary drivers
probably it does not check the lib path ?
you 'll generate the sound , and run it through the same type of effects that are on that hardware
watch 'sudo dmesg -c > > /tmp/dmesg.log ; tail -n 54 /tmp/dmesg.log ' | tee/var/log/dmesg | grep error > >
^
btw , i support the min-version idea
it 's not so much ordering but also the culling of old records , i ca n't recall the details
ie . we wo n't very well be able to t-shoot the functional test with the import error .
archive.ubuntu.com has quad-a records
including /var/log/syslog that we 've looked at
or not , seems he did it today
it even remembers the channels you were in ... and gives them back to you next time you start your
sure , sorry : )
it sounds like the pdf you are trying to view has some type of advanced adobe feature that is not
yes . i realize that that information would be gone , but i do n't really know what that means
i only have to remove the insert statements inside the media table right ? the rest do n't add any
they definitely were not in the early 2000s . they were c++ . i know a handful of grads who
what problem
5 for the group is read + exec
i do n't think it 's a physical problem because it only happes after x amount of time
do you have a switch to enable / disable the touch pad
sorry , from your questions it seemed like you had win
i 'll also note my replacement mako screen suffers from phantom touches . it will occasionally register touches all by
but systray is messed up more then this one from 15.04
i 've added comments to mps : neutron-api , charm-helpers , quantum-gateway , nova-compute and nova-cloud-controller
so , if older releases are downloadable from launchpad.net , can i add some lines in sources.list ?
right , sounds good !
well , it stopped for me a week ago or so
sounds good
just looking to compare how unity8 is doing it , one sec
sorry , just got off the phone
i did that , and i told it to save these settings to '/etc/x11/xorg.conf '
install media
also , it seems wolfe-07 is segfaulty again , i 'll reboot that
install the deb from a chrootewd recovery works ...
`` apt-get -- reinstall install linux-headers-3.13.0 { 54,55 } -generic ''
i only want a rootfs tarball
those point to an icon and an executable file to run ( usually in /usr/bin )
the provides is the owner actually
it can be .
so it 's a 'first thing in the morning ' kind of bug then
i mean , apt-get upgrade from a previous release is already evil , bad , wrong , and crying ``
yes , that was the previous release
nice to read you 're better !
ask hp
so i guess upgrading to later kernel will be a good idea then ?
check what with cowsay ?
i 'm happy , feeling glad , i got sunshine in a bag , i 'm useless but not for
no , your config is local to the user and no a package config
i just noticed i do n't have the ppa and 1.25 on this machine thuogh so not able to test
yeah i guess
your controller ? so your network interface cards ? then the command i provided was correct
did you not say you 're trying to build for dual ? if so you should set `` dual ''
i 've retried it to see if it was some weird cosmic ray thing .
that makes two of us . ; )
segfault ?
go ahead
i try to keep those iso 's around , and yes , the second one , i hope hubbunny has
well , anyway , i need a break , feel free to fwd the mail to a different location
how are you trying to start fluxbox ? sounds like xorg is n't running ...
stop it !
actually , there is a space for the icon and if i hover that space , there is a label
dont you see legacy/uefi options in there ?
yes , i 'm afraid i 'm responsible for that one
the only references i find for that are that a new kernel and video driver are required .
sudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop will take you to a default ubuntustudio
alesage : in 7 minutes . i 'll prepare the document .
thnx : )
anywhere we can see that ?
as long as the debs do n't have postinsts that are necessary , yeah .
lsb_release -a
ok , but that should be good to copy to juju stable then if it qa 's ok against quickstart/gui/deployer
anything can be.. intel just makes hardware.. if someone , such as intel , specifically provides linux support , thats
those settings do n't look much different to what i have
i see .
yes , you can import your contacts into telegram , that goes trough the content hub , and there you
it shows it now ... but i can only get to ubuntu by pressing esc twice after getting an error
let me try
the clock skew can be explained because the second run happened later .
and do you understand our difficulty with that ? you 've said it in the past , we 've had
ok . i just noticed it since a ) oxide just ( re ) gained dependency on private qt abi
yes , if it 's working .
yes but they are stored in /home . move /home to a different disk then everything works perfectly
lgtm
yep this was the initial port
if your bare metal machine has traditional bios , then you can just use the x86_64 image
after you get a functional minimal back up should make a list of installed packages and then apt-get install --
lol . i was about to google it
ok , and now `` pastebinit < ( cat /proc/partitions ) ''
same , unable to read superblock
can you hold on for a few moments please ?
really , does anyone still do that ?
qtubuntu seems to have avoided that by just putting url.encoded ( ) .constdata ( ) directly in the call to
but i have no swap : (
is the change in debian/source/format intentional ? ( i have separate mp for that )
14.10 ai n't supported anymore .
0.2.2 i just staged in the daily ppa
ok install windows then
i 'll try to regenerate diffs and see what happens ...
off even in system settings
try from the actual console
i am having problems with autopilot3 , i get errors running tests on filemanager app and calendar app , are
hrm , i suspect people will get burned by this : p
no , the train will try to be smart and change it to something following its format - be sure
it says keycode 81 is pageup here
plz make tools work properly with local streams
wow , that 's hardcore . : - )
dont
like i said , it 's not do-or-die like it is with windows , but linux is n't inherently impenetrable
why you what ?
yes .
have you checked dmesg for any output ?
you 'll need the user to run the app often , not just once
well in that case it was the cloud archive so we have a mailing list for that
the editing comment was refering to using alsa
this just puts the info into /run , and when resolvconf starts up for real , it 'll see it
^
well , how do you access your files ? on the same computer ? on a network share ?
i 'll have another branch up later that does the storageprovisioner bits , and then later today hopefully will have
i 've also just found a very strong hint that a kernel command-line boot option for acpi could fix this
nice
with the latest updates
also , note that alsa starts muted ; perhaps it needs to be unmuted ?
try pressing f12 in your browser and pasting that code there
no need for a debdiff given when you 've already added there
does it crash ?
i do hope all the regressions in 15.10 get ironed out in time !
yeah , i have no strong opinion . i just wanted to make sure we follow best practice if there
our own qtcrator does , but not the version this landing has .
-l : show ctime and sort by name ; otherwise : sort by ctime , newest first
actually , systemddm.service is the service that is the most activated in the tests
you might be right ... i 'm confused
are you on ubuntu ?
see the bug , arges commented on it .
i just hate oncompleted , but wo n't push
i was going to suggest an fsck next for this one , any better thoughts ?
yes , but let 's move further questions to # # linux where it 's more on-topic .
however , there is a test that they should start at zero ( testfacadeversionsmatchserverversions )
that unfortunately is completely different
also do you have speakers connected to the pc at the analog outputs ?
something seems to be stopping all touch/mouse interactions in test mode
are you using a different pc right now ?
great .
i have problems everytime upgrading the kubuntu version ... that really sucks ... . it costs me a whole day
how did you configure your cluster interface ? `` dns+dhcp '' ?
that is a very bad idea with just a for loop ,
ping response time from an upstream dns server ?
makes no sense why i was able to ping sites for small periods of time
you can put your /home on a drive and `` / '' on another if you want more space
did you set an eth0 cable in your machine to install ubuntu and updates enabled during setup ?
what kind of system and what graphics hardware ?
you broke it w/ rev 15
oh wow , that 's cool . back in my days of building linux from scratch they did n't make
please do pastebin it ; )
badbodh : i dont want lxde anymore , i want plane old ubuntu with my files and my programs
thx u for the help
it is actually not bad ... i take broadway all the way down to miller , then over to maple
i 'm telling you , explain your problem
i do n't think it would be safe . let 's take the simplest example : a chinese install .
oh , you did say `` or indirectly '' . so , yeah , i 'd imagine that mesa has
so these are built with the scripts to create the fat packages you mentioned a while ago , right ?
installed a ppa ?
ah , hardware problem .
understood ... tanzanite 's storage has a new client for sprint demo too ...
right that makes sense . the old style was just a link to the raw source , so indeed nothing
you are making zero sense unfortunately
maybe 1-2 month old .
the nikola guys are super helpful . i 'm using nikola for another site , and i asked them for

mherweg i doubt there 's a bios control for this since they 've explicitly put the power under hot-key control
oh yeah it does change
published
can you please please help ? i have tried everything , i can move up and down using the volume
i just did the listitemlayout component , and i made it so that rtl should work there : )
as i understand it anyway
see the error at the end of the logs : `` std : : exception : : what : failed
i guess i 'm not too sure what i mean , thats the problem when you are completely new to
love the pic btw : d indeed feels like when it unblocks : p
have you had the chance to try ubuntu touch on a tablet or phone ?
or use a terminal irc chat ( e.g . irssi )
you 'll be able to go from 14.04 to 16.04 .
i can do that
i am , yes ! we spent a long weekend at my wife 's grandmother in berlin , and helped
how 's the shebang issue treating you ?
dpkg -l phpmyadmin | grep config
quiet splash appeared again in the startup code . how do i delete it for good ?
all build tested ?
does a scrub repair it ?
you added the next one ? amazondomainclientsuite ?
then we should look to put them in the header or sth
hmm , are you typing from a live session on the target system right now ?
exactly . that was my point : )
point taken .
did you set the bootable partition flag ?
so your goal is to execute a file , and thats it ? then turn off the computer and walk
well , canonical does not ( yet ) pay for my services ; )
ssweeny just tested it , yeah
should i do an upload for that ?
well that sounds good enough !
ok , note that you 'll need a special build of indicator-power ( if you 're copying charles ' and
anyhow , the newer build seems to be correct , right ? ( as in , building the right bits
see you 've created lots of new mrs against the overlay branch
lol
that should not matter for video playback
yes
my sample did use `` ... ; read key '' a normal shell-command to wait for some input with return-key
oh ok , try it
passed the cmd package where the build issue happened on the ci machine - no issues
how do i start the user interface to set up the connection ?
ok i will
yeah , that would be useful . maybe eric and i can do something like that if we manage to
yeah i just found that one - is it sluggish ?
responded to your comments on my branch , would appreciate another look when you 've got time
did you already run dpkg -- remove-arch ... on those systems ?
will do .
got it
naw we 're all systemd now . there may be some leftover bits of upstart floating around , but it
i will fix now
find the seed where account-plugin-google is being pulled in , add ubuntu-system-settings-online-accounts to same seed , run germinate , see
i was hearing one of the current silos has a near-fix
ah hold on
as we need that for last lts - > next lts anyway
can you show me your fstab
yes , the old drive works fine but is not ssd
try what oerheks suggests
one sec
ok , again . also , i would like to know what files from the c2esp-27.tar.gz ( all or some
that 's what stack traces are for : p
if the other accounts work then its a .config folder issue . if they dont its a driver issue
eric just had a trusty user upgrade to 15.10 with do-release-upgrade -d
but as these elements can have different height , the same applies on the height of each element
ls -la /lib/modules/`uname -r` - you get something , right ?
i ve download the ccna exploration but when i open the local link , i can t open any chapter
permission to post 5 lines of instructions ?
yep my pubkeys are there
yes . we considered it vital to be able to functionally test scopes without having to have a real user
do n't know why your happy it 's all your fault ; )
i discovered today that dell announced my next machine : p now i just need a way to get one
client being the second one being started , right ?
even gave it a bit of talking up in -meeting the other day
my experience with encryptfs is when you set it up , the boot process involves you entering the passphrase to
e.g . deploy one pair sink/source in a couple of lxc containers , then deploy another pair in a kvm
what does ftbfs mean ?
okey
yes exactly
we have to try to figure out how to switch the country the wireless is acting as
when the machine boots - you say it stops on a service for example `` dns '' and hangs ,
working on the fix now - hoping to get it done for tomorrow then maybe a release tomorrow , if
not really , but again your use case is n't specific . looking at your pastebin it seems like you
i 'd advise you to install windows first then
i thought i saw a mail that she was n't going to make it ?
which ?
all very confusing anyway . purge with fire .
are you in fastboot mode ?
depends on the disks , system , and how much crap is there .
testdisk
nice
oh , right , creating the new image , do n't mind
that lv has a name , though . i need it . : )
does it work now ?
doh
er
could very well be qt 5.5
dpkg -l xserver-xorg\* linux-image\* | grep ^i | pastebinit
yeah
yes dolphin is still kdelibs4
to be clear , im not asking that you do any preperation work
it was in there originally because we were adding to metadata.yaml ; now we 'll have a separate file :
ok then .
the server installer can deal with raid as i recall
but it sounds like it is a device that the vendor did n't get fixed upstream , and that makes
can i try to start mir : : server by hand in some way to see what 's going on
yes , ask away
should be fine , but do you think we could create a new makefile command ( or a script )
sending sigint to apt-get seems safer than just deleting the lock file , right ?
how do you know
hey : )
systemd-sysv is already the newest version
strange .
nope
trying to rebuild silo 53
linux-image-3.13.0-45-generic
type apt-get purge linux-image-4.2.0-19-generic
it is possible to get the speakers to work even when the headphones are plugged in . the problem is
no way
thats because a dos attack happens from outside your computer .
approved
no one guaranteed an answer that you like .
running `` sudo -i '' and entering your password will switch to root @ if you 've been getting tired
that 's not in the database , so the importer must not be grabbing it , i 'll investigate more
but removing headerbars and keeping otherwise the same ui is like 5 lines of code
yes
remind me never to test the interwebz again : d
looks good
most mtas are n't heavy , but misconfigured mtas are crap , and even after all the handholding exim and
?
if it is a service snap_app_data_path ... if it is an app the enduser runs perhaps in the user_data_path
you know : ) it is a full day process ... 18 hours at least ... given that these super
yep
anyways ; i have the perfect thing for you
also please note if you used -- force
agreed next meeting on tuesday , 27 october 2015 @ 20:30
i can have another look if marco does n't find the time ( he said it 's next on his
plenty of ivi systems are linux-based
hmmm - what 's that ?
heh : d
misconfigured
`` grep dmi /var/log/dmesg ''
let 's do test-timestamp.before and test-timestamp.after
i get blank/black screen after the loader bar after login on my kubuntu15.10 ( semi clean )
you have string name ?
and you want me to magically know the answer to the ultimate question of life , the universe , and
you dont
yup , let me check what 's happening there
locale -a ?
i did , do n't really understand how it is relevant to my server : /
rog
i dont know what to tell ya
exactly
it 's not running , because it crashes when your end does n't work . : p
do yo also have unity installed
ubuntu 14.04 lts , packard bell
do you actually have ubuntu core installed anywhere ? on a device or a vm ?
ok , i 'll grab coffee
you could apt-pin the kernel you have if there are no issues
what else does your wife use windows for ?
particularly the ( 0 , 2 ) case -- wo n't that pass *every time* whatever the behaviour is ?
; )
the sru cycle runs for 3 weeks and repeats forever . how a release falls within a given sru cycle
well i dont doubt there was magic : p i was hoping for a bit of engineering though ; )
unless the duo was more than twice as fast
14.04 server , all packages updated
you mean right now with the current mechanism ? the recommended place is in $ snap_app_data_path
after the kernel update do you expect me to restart the pc before i run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
right now i would submit to you that you may not be on an ubuntu at all , so installing
type du -h /var | sort -h
i am playing mandolin at the moment , but i may take you up on the offer later
well what are you trying to accomplish ? this is an ubuntu support channel so support questions can get answers
or you can even go `bzr bd -s -- builder='sbuild -c chroot-name -- host=armhf'`
however , that makes it ! = 40 or 50 or 90
no , just remove it . already uploaded to xenial for the giflib soname bump
of course it does
push notifications get listed in the message indicator
have you tried developers edition
just adding it now thru synaptic
yes , that 's what i meant , my bad . /sys/firmware/efi/efivars exists if that 's what you were referring
plan on making an opengl game to sell on the store and trying to see whats out and whats not
when creating windows - it 's still there with my patch , but not as noticable because it 's wit
aha . i got it now
okay , i actually do still have a packaging question
no , sorry for the nagging , i 'm just reviewing e.u.c and pinging people before forgotting : - )
check your keyboard settings
just take a breath in future to reduce the frustration . that keeps other motivated and makes it easier to
yeah , that 's what i thought too , but it 's not clear to me if this is implemented
i 'm slightly confused about what you mean ...
ok rejected on my end
hardly , but perl regex is supported in python
yeah
so we do n't have a separation between upstream resolution and package resolution ? odd . but ok , can
i just took the link that youtube gave me
what happens then ?
so silo 41 is good ?
sudo chmod -x /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober
and what about the xsession-errors file ( second paste ) that show errors about upstart ?
yes final version is safer
my cpu takes 100 % cpu . as seen with top . searching google gave that its a problem running
no , system service file
sorry i do not know how to help with that
same here
i want it like that only show which have both phrase1 and phrase2
if so , i guess it has been disabled for a long time alreddy ?
just letting you know
yes . i was surprised , that the echo was 0 % in osx and windows with same environement/same setup
devel-proposed is not 15.10. it is the latest development version of ubuntu , which is now xenial , and it
great timing , now i 'm getting ready for dinner..
no , there 's no title even
chipaca - i agree with that statement , thats why i ask for a way to disable timesyncd in snappy
yes
bluez5 is much more stable in my system now , ok i give you , i had to backport pulseaudio
anyway i 'd be the wrong person , i look at 14.04 when milestones are close but generally i 'm
wait what ? i 'm not using two computers . only one laptop , which is the one in question
that is n't what i did though ...
what was the nature of the issue ?
yes
sorry to cancel on you at the last minute again
vnc needs a 2d desktop , and thats no longer available with unity . i use ubuntu server with a
i sent quick email to the snappy list , no replies yet
have you tried google ? the last line returns a few `` solved '' hits .
it 's big you guess ?
i do n't see any relevant with this command
yeah , that 's the position i 'm in now . i mean , it 's impossible for it to
so what 's the next stage in docs.xubuntu.org/developers thingy
good luck !
ah of course every release is rawhide
oops , that 's `` lsusb ''
just need the error message
on old distros yes
i wouldnt use 2 ssd 's in raid myself mate
it 's ubuntu 's case , not suse 's .
looks ok so far ; i 'm crawling through the bugs , but we are now at the level of
14.04 lts
yes
for the record i have the exact same problem when i use a wifi network emited by my cellphone
different issue , `` everything 's breaking '' sadness though . : p
yes ; i. e. if there is no rcs.d/*networking at all
hi . got a support question ?
to r152 or later and it should be good
well.. i guess it 's the correct one then : )
its a common issue ! but kills plasma
sure , i can try to adapt the latest fixes in gnome-desktop3 to 3.16 . is the upstream code in
either what robbix said , or using the software centre
yay ...
i 'm a web developer : d
yep that 's why hiding widget must be done by gtkheaderbar widget itself ( via a property , or a
the encryption process never finishes because of the rsync problem . and i have backups of /home so no worries
that is settled
that 's very unlikely
ask him about why i am so hyper : p
ok
aisrael yep , hit it with the bundle one as well
you could ship the library in your click package.. which is also not very pretty
mh , ok ... maybe i 'm on the queue then
that 's what it should do . do n't know if there are edge cases ?
but this is what i am asking
ahhh , read further , those are expected whilst dnsmasq starts and arrives on the dbus .
what de ?
np , you could disable the `` ask password after screen turns off '' option
just literally edit the spreadsheet cell to remove the mp you do n't want then add the one you do
^
have a good day : - )
i 'm always available to sponsor packages
not uploaded yet , was waiting for numix , can do so though
that seems a bit excessive
show us the /etc/network/interfaces file you 're using
he gone .
is that what you call that
should i make an msdos partition table ?
you mean the guide wont cater in my case . pls suggest links which i can go through .
what happens in system-settings when you check for updates ?
to make it easy for folks to use newer versions of go and still have the pre-push hook
try it and see what breaks .
i have just reverted back to old drivers
happy2help !
tell you what , boot and delete `` quiet splash '' too
i 'll try to eleminate all other possible causes and get back to you i guess
i am there now
did you use strace -f , perhaps a subprocess is involved
first of all , boot the laptop in recovery mode and to a root shell
@ 1455109 - so we change status to confirmed ? and push to the kernel team ?
and can you mark the task as 'complete ' instead of him ?
same computer , you see .
try 14.04 to test
with count 1 , 10 and 100 - which is far smaller than 13gb .
doing good !
do you know if there is a way or if we plan to enable via snappy config ubuntu-core to setup
yeah , but he tends to be around at different hours by accident ; )
if nobody expects us to merge , that 's fine then : )
lsinitramfs can parse it
sorry , not happening .
have a good day
gadget-snaps-for-prod ( which looks great on staging btw : )
: d
for a suitable price i could probably be persuaded to part with it : )
yep
i have a comment about that so there 's some glib call you have there ...
what did i say to begin with ? you have a habit of making volunteers go around in circles after
it would be nice if rb handles moves ( and deletes ) better
but not for ppas , they get removed on uploads of newer sources to the ppa
where do you turn off safe boot ? is it a bios setting or a windows setting or something else
how do you load images ?
i dont know what you did click there in the installer : /
the response you get will be a link to your xorg.error log on a `` pastie '' site . that
only if you promise they are really stupid : )
i 'll have a look when i get home and see if it 's something obvious at the copy job
thx
sudo mount /dev/sde /boot
nope
i was also seeing the failure locally . is there a missing build-dep then ?
we 'll discuss what are the following steps later this week , because we want something that can be common
ive gotten conflicting information
php-cgi just exploded again , is there i can restore the system to original without direct access to it (
yes , it really depends on what nodejs lets you configure . it may have a fixed document root or
needs ffe .
you mean like linux conventions
it 's not a big deal .
^^^ ?
silly question , but , the `` already in use '' messages in the log file - they *are* repeating
that is not a web server .
idk about ssh but i can use teamviewer when the screen is asleep
lol
classical misread : d
whats dfp2
are you using snapp ?
i can call it `` invalid '' to make it explicit that we 've faked it - or `` juju-private-default
can i see that too ?
yup , it sounds like you 've got an answer for that prepared above i can see
wfm ! can you do it or do you need somebody to do it for you ?
please pastebin the output of `` locale '' for me .
he selected ubuntu desktop at the tasksel step of the installer
agreed
go test triggers a panic because the timeout set for the test run was exceeded
i would try a fresh install mate
well i 'd change the cable if you have one spare , or just reseat it at both ends if
well apparently you already know what all needs to be done , so nothing we can answer you in here
yeah , my kbd sucks and i 'm on it for to long today already : )
guess i 'll have to seek non-ascii entertainment elsewhere , then . *whips out dosbox with wolfenstein 3d*
sure
the flags in lp : mir look correct .
understood . my bad . sometimes i should n't try to help !
google should say something about it , then
i guess we decided that one should be in 1.25 ? ^
i know what a pain gstreamer is to recompile : )
but the existing one would be for free ?
if only all of you would move to the us : p
i just remembered that this occoured after using nautilus
what 's non-default ?
yes ... . alright . then i hacked till late on unity / nautilus : -p
you said yesterday something about nvidia depraced ?
which one ?
the previous build should have been mostly complete
so the palette in 1.3 may look slightly different from 1.2 and below
the prime tool tries to install nvidia stuff , which is n't necessary on amd equipment
what is the baby status ?
yea but that is still kinda not needed when you can install gnome and lxde at the same time .
yep
i 'll add something
the test does n't make sense anymore . it 's not that we *ignore* the initial address event ( anymore
it is recommended to not put anything graphical on a server , securitywise .
i like stardict myself , though i also have goldendict , but stardict has a qt gui , qstardict ,
what auronandace is correct , not an official ubuntu packages
like i said , either you want a bootable flash drive made up or not - asking the channel 5
ah , that would be a whole 'nother issue
what company do you work for , if i may ask ?
ok try thunar
dbus-activated through unity
what else could it be ? can not be uitk because i do have logs from the very same uitk
oh wait i didnt read properly , sorry .
; )
with open-source driver my display does not hangs but i get black screen when i resume from suspend
i 'm at a loss of about $ 2000 because i fell for the shiny
well , the problem is that it 's not a small wrapper , because have to provide all the ui
yeah did a first attempt which was meant to be an update of the vivid package for android which is
you can do what you like , but , im telling you how i do it , to get the
no different
ignore that . i mean to say that apt-get shows it as already installed
especially not with curl , see above
desrt arrives at 1 or so . weekend was awesome . *lots* of wine and going 20km on a draisine
then please specify the image rev . , installed oxide package ( liboxideqtcore0 ) and web url being played
yeah what
snappy is the evolution of click if you will
it was just sample text abot typography , you dont have to follow it
so plenty of pressing power buttons .
does n't work in mediaplayer-app here ( except for the sound )
so zenity works on desktop i assume ?
i know . what i 'm saying is that template.pot is too generic . it should be projectname.pot
looks like mysql-server-core-5.5 is now mysql-server-core-5.6
does jenkins use something besides qemu ?
printer works fine ( it 's a printer/scanner )
k
that 's their problem
is that necessary ?
it means the package is in wily-proposed
well that is definatly missing in the 4.2 initrd
yo .
ah ... really , creates it on the fly ?
not a big deal , but is a different install slightly . i see 4 partitions , under a msdos
is it safe to assume you 're using nautilus ?
we see it on every ./run-checks on snappy . so it will be easy to confirm .
usuaally 9050
+1
already said seems more a vbox problem , have you asked them ?
ah ok. well i 'll probably be on tomorrow too
no its a seperate package
ah right , more indirectly
you to . ; )
see there 's my mistake
?
that 's a stop-gap . in a follow-up , the individual errors will be used to decide whether or not
just plasma , they seperated it into 3 parts , plasma is beautiful now imo.. i use to not really
see `` dmesg '' if there is a hardware issue
i 'm running mako locally and i ca n't reproduce . elleo says he can repro sometimes during normal app
is in unity8 , qml/components/physicalkeysmapper.qml - nothing too special , listens for key events , uses timer
so which ubuntu release are you on ?
did you consider splitting the code into two halves to make it more comprehensible ? specifically , have one function
store version is busted too , so not a regression
as it clearly differentiate between what is blocked/waiting/parked/cancelled
i guess you were always `` oh god ... icons : ( `` when the lo/abiword discussion started again :
i 'm assuming this is with regard to bridging for reaching into the containers from outside your host right ?
now if i could just get autopilot to do the right thing with my actual tests : )
yeah im sure i can . i can also get in to the recovery console
ok , try to make a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications for mono
right , but my license is only for eagle 5. i got it from my school
and thunar version 1.6.6 ?
that 's a good justification for not learning . anyway , so you have some old kernels listed huh ?
sadly i do n't , there 's no root ssh connection running , only a webserver that 's constantly on
how do i move them ? ?
but cgproxy would be in the container , and cgproxy is having the problem , so the container must be
it 's up
but you 've never explained what your actual purpose is .
tell it to burn the dvd from the contents of the iso file , that 's usually referred as ``
could you pastebin the output of 'ip r ' ?
although someone with more knowledge would have to help with the hfs part ... ive used ntfsresize to do the
`` they '' ?
i dont know about every program for linux . so best is to ask the specialists . there is a
where 'd pete-woods go , btw ?
1.8 should have a real solution to this problem
excellent : )
like i said , we could still do it , but i 'd rather *not* have everyone retranslate that due
right . like i said , i 'd go at my drive and turn it off/on to determine the bigger
cheers : p
yes
trying to , ill call after ericsnow_ 's patch is reviewed
will this be on the official port system when it all works ?
hi
did you try the guest account ?
desktop , yeah , a usb modem dongle
i carried forward your s390 patches from 4.3 . i _think_ i 've got the right abi files . i
ok , if you ( or someone in your team ) could test it on the phone that would help
not directly , though i occasionally provide contributions to nginx there
ok , i 've added the link to the card , and will move it as a reminder
fyi , there 's the tech-debt bug 1425245 i filed for your suggestion
ooi , why deb_host_arch instead of deb_build_arch ?
you over for release next weke ?
they are by default dynamic ( created as required ) but you can set a number in gnome-tweak-tool
if one was for certain better , everyone would be using it
is `` screendelegate '' as an objectname okay ?
try # ubuntu for help on this .
aye : /
oh ok , very odd
what was the max number you used ?
does it tell you which bit is wrong ?
i would suggest that you install as usual ... and after installation edit the /etc/fstab to mount the partition on
make siure the kernel installs usually with a dist-upgrade then comment the ppa with a # and later if you
why not try # ldap ?
all indications are that i will have trouble with loadshedding again
tricky , i just opened meld and the background was black . i have a vivid system upgraded from utopic
ok that makes sense , then when the fix land we should expect that the mode is try , right
lp : ~cimi/unity8/fix-open-new-scope-from-tmp
this is why :
sure , the interesting questiion is non-local ( vm/container/device )
there can be differences between cold ( power loss ) boot and 'warm ' boot ( if the +5v standby
can you give me a link ?
exactly .
well a bound bind that does n't reply to anything is n't much yse
but i 'd click a `` donate '' button to keep the content coming
well , there 's nothing stopping you trying . go full on the form on our site
in principle is opensource i expect to find in some repo all the needed things
also ... check out the new now playing page ... from the designs sam made a while back
you can use regular ubuntu desktop iso now for laptops
ok. ack
i also have a hard time to figure out where it is crashing . the syscalls it is using are
manually created job , i guess ? that would explain why your new infra did n't run it , only
it 's generic ubuntu , not even kubuntu or whatever
which loop in particular ? while timelineview.contentx ! = val : self.app.main_view.swipe_view ( direction , self.week_view ) ?
if they find it : )
you should follow what brainwash is telling/asking you to check
try sudo mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume /media/my_device
your users will randomly get one record or the other to use , so roughly half of your users will
i guess we copied that from the ubuntu-core seed , we started from there
so just use `` sudo apt-get install munin '' : )
yup
regarding autopilot , no , not yet . but the bug seems feasible
and restart ubuntu-push-client
no luck . i already did that command . i got a whole bunch of additional servies in dolphin ,
good point , it does look much less dead
the only main difference i see is no charm-tools , while this should n't have a change in juju-quickstart ,
mentioning you , since you responded to the review about needing a test for it
ooh now 6 ... .
sudo apt-get purge packagename
14.04
understood . 8 years ago it was n't though ! a lot of people must have this problem . google
i had never used any device liek thant , wont help here but it is worth trying to ask on
yeah ... i would have assumed it would just skip if it does n't know what to do with it
oh , is that click review tools ?
aha , so hpa = yes , but `` 0/1 '' ... that 's not right !
it is
unless you vote +0 , when ochosi 's vote becomes tiebreaker
not if current works
it was 1 bad sector
ok - instructions updated - it works for me now
lgtm
you need compatibility library
secure boot disabled ?
is that different from mv /etc/alternatives/default.plymouth /etc/alternatives/default.plymouth.old for instance ?
the solution was `` sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf '' . why this problem occurred , i have no idea , but
yeah but i was connected over v4 , guess that is preferred still
that 's the problem , it changes at every run
right ; or more precisely , we ignore test failures of the current version of sbuild
number 2 next year
and this is the english channel ...
its winter now
there 's a chance that updated microcode is already provided by your firmware : )

make a bug report for the two network managers and we can do something about it ( probably hide one

is there a question whether or not you tested the right thing ?
ah that one
i edited to make it fit thought ; - )
right , that 's a different pair of pants , and we 'll likely resume the app in that case
yes
done
after flashing , yes
do you think that my issue is better suited for server or vanilla ubuntu ?

can you comment on the bug please where else you see it ?
he said it works on xubuntu ... just making sure the settings are ok
what are you hoping to achieve ?

the uos is public planning anyway lol
is that the output in /var/log/cloud-init.log , or is there more info there ?
the hosting providers do a lot of stuff for you and hide the complexity behind what you 're doing .
quick question , where do i place the app icon so that it gets picked up ?
so it sort of makes sense
in moontsone talking to jam about the spec
good logic indeed
ok
like ms2/mh/thumnailer all seem to take different formats
i do this before but i dont know how can i confgured it ?
the decision was to change the default ... it does n't break too many ...
you can use dvr t oreduce traffic through the gateway
just install that then , and use it
looks like the host does n't have sufficient ram
such as the device it self ? so settings can be manually changed in u-s-c ?
it sure looks like it at a glance .
but i believe you can use any of the konqueror plugins in rekonq anyway
you ca n't push to whatever build machine they are using for arm ?
i 've not seen that before . looks like upstream is keeping those files around - not the debian maintainer
ok , that 's enough to be getting on with
hmm , but we did n't have multi-series charms back then
i 'm not quite sure what you 're asking . can you state your question again all on one line
the upgrade to 15.04 took quite nicely .
could be gnome , gpu drivers , and chrome at the same time .
it looks the same to me
cool
i 'm on linux mint 17

i 'll merge today , though , so we can see how this affects new bugs .
we had some discussion about this at the last meeting but it seemed like we could n't quite get to

i should choose previous linux versions ?
yeah no patents on species : p
that 's fine with me , i selected the font size as small and replaced _ in the app id
faster and lighter and easier to install and configure
that 's not acceptable . i am preparing for a config change on a live server . if apt-get enables
not intentionally . it may have been like this for a while without me noticing , been a few days
well , somebody does . i thought he did the platform image creation code
cool . yeah , i do n't see any crashes either .
yep , i know people use livecd and chroot to get stuff fixed , but i 'm too lame for

do you plan to use the hibernation feature ?
so it 's the answers that matter more precisely than who might be asking them

alright , looking at that
but i like chrome : /
so it 's just adb/mpt maybe in which case blame ogra_ : )
i do n't really trust it .
yes , i did an upgrade from 14.04.2 to 14.10
excellent . let me know if there 's anything else .
what if i have 13.10 ?
and the underlying filesystem is irrelevant , since you mount the smb share .
the mp will not be marked as merged as well because of that , as it will only be partially-merged
no other arrays on the system
so what to do now ?
( because i ca n't figure out how to get out of this state via the ui )
but i have n't opened meld since i moved to vivid , so any time after that
no packaged named 'pkzip ' . is it 'pktools ' ?
surely we have `` ubuntu '' substrings in our versions .

reinstalling grub
do i have to turn of fast & secure boot options ?
can you use that in a command . e.g . to overwrite a file , can you do `` cp

better to ask in # ubuntu-offtopic - this channel is for support
ignorance is not bliss : p
^^
indeed
yep , on my list
yes , but in 14.04 you have to restart systemd-logind after installing cgmanager and the nlog back in
so the fact that it is n't listed there means that it 's not possible . am i reading that
having a head injury sucks
yes i did the hard shutdown and booted with no problems . but sudo restart result in problems 70 %

syslog is in /var/log/syslog , mysql usually logs to the syslogger .

can i write local plugins yet ?
i 'll look at the current state of things .
have you updated juju recently ?
so it 's passwrd ( myusername )

that 's ok ?
then check in the browser `` download '' section , if it 's an incomplete download , it 'd allow
of what ?
you follow the steps in that last link you showed me ?
ok
yeah , we did n't have any transition code under upstart
compare it to other , existing .desktop files . anything that stands out ?
( sorry )
i do it more than 5 times

not about teh repetition but about its duration
my video works fine ( display )

they are n't scopes then , they are apps , just long press them and select uninstall
yup ; the android bits are isolated in a container , away from the distro : )
oh ! i should review code then , perhaps the paths where somehow incorrect o_o

we 'll get that from 'root ' since the command-line is active , and that infers ( $ root )
it worked with kde 5.4.2-0ubuntun but with 5.4.3-0ubuntu1 no

ah
but nothing seems to have crashed ? all the tests run to completion .
and indeed that 's the message i get : )
nope ... they did n't document much of anything . although they were n't using the server heavily so i

sry , that 's what `` stdin '' means to me ; )
that 's my bad , i keep forgetting about the off-topic channel ... started out with a support question but
just start with kicking a jenkins rebuild next time
few requirements i would have ( maybe you addressed them already ) ... like for example the ucs supports versioned
so i can know if anything i should n't have

correct , i couldnt..
also makes the local package lists on your machine much bigger .
so it requires a separate collection for the refs
i guess everything migrated correctly , let me kick a new ubuntu-rtm image : )
alternatively , do n't run updates unless you are willing to restart if required .
okay that 's what i have now . but i have both displays connected to graphics card . there is

what was this update to ll for re suspend ?
there is no proper command , because you 're doing something that is not proper

yah i just pushed an upgrade .
will they keep the progress of download even on system reboot ? ?
yep , i can see that : )
ouch : /
it could be a bad kernel , or bad graphics driver
k
responding
yeah but in 14.04 i used to turn it off my adding acpi=force in kernel options but here it doesnt
need any log from my end ?
yeah ok : )
i guess it would be more clear to change `` start on : sys : rotate-logs '' to `` start
hmm.. yea guess i did n't mention that.. i 'm trying to figure out how to unstick that test :
try to log out then back in maybe
never mind what ?
hit winkey for the dash and type additional drivers

so i hvae to install vdpau = ?
um maybe - but ... . it 's really old and you 're going to be stuck with really old
which cmake ?
how is your network configured ?
otoh , why do we need a `` wizard-has-run '' file on the live cd ?
click f12
just know that testinitialaddresseventignored also runs into this problem
once you and eryndiamonds finish , can i ask you for help ?
were you intending putting it on the website ?
nothing readily available . let me google it
at least , this is my guess .
sorry , i mean hd1 , gpt2
i shouldnt .
did you see my request about using ubuntucolors instead ?
just to verify , this is an issue you 've got since going from 12.04 - > 14.04 , even
which link is blank ?
install the broadcom firmware
i am using symlinks , so does that mean that i can make my home like 10gb or something ?
but , machine removal should indeed trigger `` set all allocated ips to dead for this machine id ''
i still investigating what is causing the problem
when i said 'soon ' i was being ironic and really meant never ; - )
so you 're checking for a user input to see if that 's a bundle string ?
i do n't seem to have the ubuntu.web qml components in my sdk ide , is that normal ?
^
i sadly do n't know
i simply can not coerce my vm or actual hardware to fail : (
can you `` hexdump -c /etc/fstab | nc termbin.com 9999 ''
you should consider stopping using ubuntu wrong , if you ca n't get things working with 14.04 : )
good question . i wonder if ubuntu will still work when i install mint in a second partition .
if there 's only 1 .deb in debian/control dh_install will install to debian/ < packagename > instead of debian/tmp and
it looked good to me , but i do *always* check that sort of thing
not available for install via apt-get either
ca n't really so that without being able to first download a new release . which i ca n't ,
seems like you did a chmod 777 on several folders
but can i run the app from there ?
and he installed linux on it ?
youve helped me enough tonight . i wonder if there is an example i can find on google ? the
nope just wanted to make sure you were n't trying to hard : )
ok , perhaps squid.internal has different policies depending on who requests it
you want lucasz right ? ; - )
good luck , but really that should work like a charm
but i could start with the isnotsupported as a first and only one *g*
system76 ditched flash player on their machines
works . do n't understand why the other wo n't work , though
it 's always one more thing with those timezones . i 'm glad the silo fixes it : - )
type sudo parted -l
i took a picture from the recovery output does that help ?
yes : d
and redo it ...
no no , the terminal-app is now the reboot one
he disable the secure boot and not usb : )
i 'm not familiar with that one but i 'm saying you ca n't just stop building an arch that
match the timestamps with the last , failed , boot attempt . those logs may contain entries from the current
what is one to do with 60 gb of log files , the vast majority coming from a whiney usb
then i hope they do n't screw it up for me . )
hmm i will have to scour the trust-store project for the qml source then
cs : go is buggy : (
ok , i thought it would be part of multi-env
interesting , its a by product of the py3 support . base class for self there is an interator
tsdgeos and why on first boot
the rtm-14.09 branch is out of sync because thostr_ released the last ubuntu-rtm mediascanner2 package as a sync from vivid
no you still do n't make any sense
either offer a system specification or you are unlikely to get help
do you have a battery backup ?
`` ifconfig -a | pastebinit '' please - may have to instal pastebinit
what 's the intended layout ?
you start developing
heya
no , how did you change your locale ?
what does force-push mean in the mp=
ok thats installing
so here is what i am trying to do - > main fs on sda , sdb-e will be raided
i 'm on mobile , can you invite me ? randomincolorado @ gmail.com
reateckpci extpress qualcomm atheros
yeah , qmlscene could need a boost
hm command not found
see # unity to read more about the error i have
now it does n't like it ? it 's been running on this thing for over a year .
bizarre . and i assume `` apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source '' installs that cd version ?
ok , so no poking !
ok
ah so ubuntu.components is ok ?
done .
execute the script every second and change it to write to a file in /tmp confirm the file is created
right ... just s/armhf/i386/ in the download
np
it seems to be a rec for informix csdk - client sdk
alright . i will make the bugreport in about 1 h
welcome
i was installing nvidia cuda before the zsh thing , but i had many restarts after i had installed it
remind me why we care about pdf output again ?
we 've been actually discussing this one
a little busy ... ..pfffff i wish i was only a little busy ; )
any error messages when you run 'make click ' ? can you pastebin ?
just the other kernel version
a crude workaround could be to add a fake external port to the snap which has config applied by firstboot
right that what happening to me too
indeed
hmm ... looks like some issue with mesa-common-dev in ppc64el
and can you not just use a usb stick ?
strong +1 to :190
nope
and even if *that* unit runs a hook with a response really fast
which one was it ?
ok , good to go . just mind the conflict in rtm1
i 'm just giving you info about support here so you do n't paint yourself into a corner and ask
your probably fine then
yeah , i see that in the amulet test you updated
ah , you are n't running with developer mode enabled ?
but i do think it 's worth thinking about . afaics , fact that a controller is an environ is
shall i propose against reboot i guess ?
is it a fresh install ?
its worth noting that by using the charm-store for the charms , you can fix charm revisions for repeatable deployments
same like you
yes , webdriver is needed . there are some things possible from qml , but it 's not nice .
that 's good to know . i did n't play with it enough to see if it was every launch
behave .
i can repo it on 5 systems
it does matter . this channel supports ubuntu . deepin is n't ubuntu
heeeeey , i have the usual request ; )
my understanding is that zuul only examines a change for gate+merge when a workflow +1 happens .
good job
i 'd install using uefi
also , mladoux has a good point on disk space checking
if you 're fine with waiting three months between kernel updates , then just reboot every three months
read into `` photorec ''
ok , if you 're doing the e-mail , then i 'll take it out of my plate
no sorry there is no debs . the ppa version was set up to build the 0.3 branch , so
so ntfs will be needed in that situation , wo n't it ? unless suddenly youcan jnstall windows on ext4
i used my own , then they dropped v1 and i have n't upgraded .
no
ok ... so that worked
aha i was thinking everything stays the same !
not even in the ppa
could well be
i 'm more of a debianite these days
yes
sure , in systemsettings > privacy settings
does n't seem to be it . i deleted all the steam files and uninstalled . then made sure i
so when do we use the requestedurl ?
how 's things ?
no , it 's compiz
i have a lenovo ideapad .
yes . flash ?
or join mailing lists
good on the blank new tabs , will file the bug later today
because that 's the version i 'm running
is network manager handeling your eth0 ?
the one or more maintainer decide
you 're ignoring the minor version of -49 .
i had already moved from mitte to pankow earlier .
what you see ?
there is a monitors.xml file
has it always been like that ? i seem to remember it being able to recover as soon as i
^
so one remaining question , how do we modify our depends : to be sure we have the 5.6 import
just a normal `` check for upgrade '' and `` install all ''
uhm sure i can share the oem snap , though the snaps are not in the store
second , that sounds like learning to dev - so why not find an appropriate channel ?
but then , you 're tapping on an item which is there before the new query completed
ok , so atm this crashes on the gdk bits ; do you have a backtrace ?
re that mail - mostly just to keep you in the loop - unless you 've got comments of course
reviewed , off for school pickup , bbiab
shell
you would have libreoffice-vanilla ( source package ) build twice and create two binary packages : libreoffice-vanilla and libreoffice-vanilla-debug (
ah , s/got ride/are getting ride ; - )
what is your actual problem
for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run ; do sudo mount -b $ i /install $ i ; done
nope , its a nightmare : )
go ahead ; ) )
in a meeting
same in the app
well , i work when i get a chance , sometimes having 3 kids under 4 years old means that
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor gives what ?
by pointer i mean c pointer
curious as we see many here whose search phoo is not so good .
hehe , i know the feeling ; i 've thuoght before it might be easier to write tools by hand
could you explain / show this custom initramfs script ?
should memtest , smartctl and fsck not fix your issue , then the problem is most likely somewhere else ,
i doubt that it 's a good idea to paste
yes , and it ensures everything ( screen and windows ) agrees on the format of truecolor pixels
it confirms that we 're not wasting our time when the media is corrupted
but the above would be a case where vivid-updates does n't make sense
we do build vms with foreman/puppet.. but these physical boxes are not built that way
samba is not running
old install , but didnt change anything realy
sure . no other devices or disks . the system is bios for sure . the disk is gpt .
what might have happened is that you drive got recognized with a different device name e.g . 'sdc ' instead
just reconfigure that and try a reboot
zith break=init i get my password asked
no it 's trusty
when i said `` sudo gedit grub.cfg '' , i was assuming you had already gone to the /boot/grub directory

frobware_ : in this case it 's mark shuttleworth asking for a ppa ...
yeah but you do n't exist
looking
no , i ca n't get past it : d
i 'll run you up the flagpole . : ) julien ( gilir ) is head of development , so
huh . did it move ? it *used* to be there
you can increase the verbosity level several times
how i can copy paste errors from terminal
i though it was maybe parsing changelog and substracting closed bugs
yes
the part of my brain that understands every language ever , at least well enough to debug , seems to
now it is - i had issues mostly around getting the 4k screen to work with my external hd monitor
the bug is that the *mousearea* is too small .. visually yes its too small but it infact dismisses rather
thx
you 're not too dull after all : -p
awesome . looks like owncloud is now working . you are appreciated .
and also , i still had n't sadly figured out a way to get the enabled/disabled status of a service
do n't tell me that , like didrocks , you are a chocolat hater ? !
what you guys are asking for is done by nearly every dba there is
yw !
right now that 's not possible because we have an automatically added env life assertion on almost all txns
not yet
is it : `` mysql-server mysql-server/root_password shinypassword '' ?
not having the module loaded would just not make it work , correct ? or can it cause irc issues
yes , see the urls i gave
it 's just a fyi on a bug i spent my day on yesterday
ok , cool
please keep this channel family friendly .
you should be able to just do package_to_rebuild ?
it depends on the status quo too ; if the descriptions were consistent already , then of course it would
we can ship it in ubuntu-core-config then
mybe you could fsck it to check everything
you could install fail2ban , perhaps someone is hammering your ssh
it does indeed , but making npm run quietly seems to make it faster too
they are covered by ( c++|arch= ! amd64 ! arm64 ! ppc64el ) rule
cherylj , i 'd wait for that until tomorrow tbo
it can , mine does

why which ?

you can do that , but that uses port 587 , not port 25 , and not portforwarding

too late . call just dropped . : )
maybe we ca n't rely on page_resolver.get_page_queryset_from_path
its just not appropriate for audio production

you 're not having much luck are you ! ?
can you remember wich modules ?
exactly yes , and the vm guest/windows 7 to connect to the pcs on the lan

yes , but they implement it in different ways , as joeb3_ can attest ; )
no , as in i rewrote it sanely
if 1.23 was split of trunk already then yes , do n't block trunk
have you tested locally to see if the application launches properly at that point ?
there is an ifcfg-p55p1 for the physical interface , with no ip address assigned ( inet manual )
because they are n't tested ? : )

nice suggest ... i will give it a try propably

what do you suggest changing in the sdk to test ?
i see ...
well , i would n't complain if someone competent ( like you ) did the work and asked me to
and touchx , touchy , etc will move in a smooth way , instead of jumping to the actual touch
how do i fix it for the time being ?
?
because id upgraded it to an unstable version and it kept crashing my computer

if its a 13.xx you are way too late for upgrading and not only missing features like mtp support but
nice to see those changes coming btw !
well not properly then
i got to get this working by tonight , so i do n't see i have any other choice but
well i did a do-upgrade and wanted to get to 14.10 , but apparently 15.04 was installed and now it
what are you installling anyway ?
i do n't think that 's supported , so i do n't think it needs to be in steps126
where did you get those numbers ? made up or is there an article you read ?
i removed all packages that ware listed in original apt-get install and cleaned the rest per your request
yup , it does .
nice . when did that get fixed ?
i have n't had reports of it in some weeks .
that 's why i asked , i can also hold on to it until b2
try apt-get dist-upgrade
are you in 15.04 ? 14.04 ?

correct

there is no logging for system-image
ok mate , dig out your logs then
fine , except that should be lp : not bug :
404 for me too : )
paste.ubuntu.com/11885214
yeah your always present here , but xenial will be highly wanted this time : p
but it seems its likely on server side rather than package
i mean what created the original files . most file managers will try to preserve permissions when copying .
same on public jenkins : )
yeah makes total sense
now really lame question . since i ca n't access ff menu at all , how do i see ff
dpkg -l | grep linux-headers too
oh nice ! i 'll take a quick peek now
blacklisting would mean you cant use the device indeed
feel free to resend if you wish : )

wait ... it will be excellent if it works : -p

is it possible to tell apparmor that mkdir is allowed in that directory , and then any read/write access is
why would n't they be available ?
let me look
make sure you 're booting in uefi mode rather than legacy , or we wo n't be able to use
yes - it update is off , no apt-sources or packages are installed
i believe so , yes .
or maybe you did something weird on the client side
ok , i understand that some people may appreciate this solution , but what about making it configurable ?
after pressing that , the entry appear in `` files '' indicator .
fair enough
add a comment on the card once it 's done , and we 'll unblock it

thx man..
here 's bug 1477357
i 'm actually suppressing them via kernel cmdline option corrently
yeah sure , i just know that other package managers _can_ do that : d
inchalah tm we will take pictures . but check elacheche_anis about posting on failbook : )

urulama that 's a bit : ( as openstack is preparing new release and their bundles are kind of busted

you can always backport fixes , if you can find or develop patches for them .
seems to , yes , thx again ! ! !
mostly it is going to be used for academic purpose only , running simulations etc . so will it incur
just needs to depend on syslinux-common .
yes , it is passed to the program you specify in execstart
: yes i did and it rebooted my lappy
i 've seen this but it doesnt have much details
nope : )
if i dont have second point , what is point it ask me to select one ?
15.04 is n't going to get any real upgrades since it 's not an lts release
are you talking about the critical blocker ? i have n't commented on the bug ... does the description on
it 's testing that the firewaller does n't start when firewall-mode is `` none ''
have you checked the nvidia driver parms in case it has one to control this ?
10 years is considered lucky .
idk if thats the way i can describe it lol , but i want it to show as a second
any luck ? if not try this , sudo ln -s /usr/share/kde4/servicetypes/konqpopupmenuplugin.desktop /usr/share/kservicetypes5/
yeah , there is some manual copying around on the server
yes , i only have ubuntu on a vps , no gui
is there a workaround for that bug ?
did you click finish at the end ?
so jenkins still fails , should i just try doing another pr to update charmstore.v5-unstablel to use charmrepo.v2 ?
jibel sent an rt to create the /wily view on public jenkins ; no idea whether that also needs action
faenil made a branch with sections that includes scrolling of the sections . maybe that branch solved it .

i did sudo add-apt-repository ppa : kubuntu-ppa/next-backports
yes i hope so , look like i 'm busy here for another couple of hours
if you have any more issues , just stop in and ask
i 'll try not to harass you about the bug then
is this a daily poke i get for having something ftbfs ? ; )
it is job schedule
that is weird ; i do that operation daily and never experience that issue . *thinking*
otherwise it should spit out alarm error codes which does n't happen either
cool , and then it 'll just sit in proposed ? or actually flow all the way thru ?
in 15.04 ?
let me try first : (
regardless no mint help here , sorry .
oh nice , any reason why the image is so big ?
now again : `` apt-cache policy linux-image-generic ''
hm , that looks really weird it crashes in qxcb

that is an implementation detail though . exposing such an implementation detail via argument ordering , is bad : )
i am stupid and always thinking how this or that part or componet could work better
xmodmap -e `` keycode < esc keycode > = < search keycode ''
this is trolling .
that feels like we 're saying x86 is more supported than other archs , which is n't what we communicate
they are discussing inserting sleep commands in that thread , near the end . some other things as well .
log-out the gui , do it from the tty
yeah , the snappy runner
then type sudo partprobe so the kernel knows about the changes
i have lvm
poked an infinity lately ? i got someone to pull in a pidgin with gst1.0 .
yeah i will test it out again
networkmanager overwrites resolv.conf if it 's used . you can set nameservers in the gui for your connections
what if it crashes ?
weird . i logged in into a guest account as you said . the laptop did suspend / hibernated (
right , precisely that . power up phone from off so nothing 's already been done , from the pc
i am in root shell with networking

yes , when i have time . why is it urgent for you ?
i 'll try ; )
how to remove that
i am the root
anyone who uses sed is used to such things : )
my os is on an mbr drive , but it is an external drive that i consider using gpt
feel free to ping me if we should try something different . also , if/when you have a build to
i only have one internet connection cable , and it 's being used by this computer
?
it 's the feral ones they hide , next year they fight back , i might be confusing turkeys and
ok , then try entering grub holding shit at boot , then choose ubuntu recoverymode and 'fix broken packages '
well , it will get a bulk-sync from debian ; )
what does upi stand for ?
edit the bug description
why would i do that ?
go back to ctrl+alt+f1 , and type sudo apt-get install -- reinstall ubuntu-desktop
now works ?
ty
: dpkg-reconfigure darnpackage < result ?
the only library you have to worry about is libc , and that rarely gets a major version bump
all these packages installed via apt-get ?
uff , reading the bug is longer than the fix : )
if you ca n't stay on topic , please feel free to find another channel
what 's up ?
i can create an image myself if above u-d-f does the trick
sorry , now i see the context . replying to messages with that user 's nick helps .
ahh . have n't tried it on intel , but it should work on any kernel modesetting drivers
i dunno . the logs for trusty imply it 's pulling the main hints .
python-click was blacklisted by cjwatson , iirc .
so if you do n't see any pending or running then ping a ~charmer to kick them off
okay i 'll reflash mako and krillin
however , if i 've misunderstood on that point then using a template *would* make sense : )
ok that is plain wrong and has been plain wrong since it was first released by the looks of it
alrite i will test on my vivid desktop with eds and approve/comment on the mr tonight .
gotcha , so share some charms but not necessarily all
err , how does that help ?
cool ; so we have a much easier handle on this
danke
ah missed him leave
sure , but if i did n't know about ls /bin i would have never figured out the different commands
when is it ?
anyway we can start with that
i 've seen azure deployments timing out at 15mins . tests by default use a 15 min timeout , you
new issue for nested lxd is # 1002 , for some reason the nested lxd ca n't read the server
key combo alt+f7 to return to the gui .. to terminate the terminal and go to la-la land type '
ok. jhodapp , maybe you should join the next tuesday 's meeting and we 'd try to get the final
where are you stuck ?
prolly not
so maas does support ipv6 subnets ( max of one per interface )
oh , sure !
same thing
yeah i 'm not going to be able to fix that soon , that 's a giant mess . wow
no fud please . if you do n't want , disable or install a different buntu
the reason we have you start them with question is because we get a highlight on them to keep track
1000 % sure , using it for a long time like that .
you can safely choose 'something else ' , then if it puts a mention of 'efi ' besides the high
dooferlad , so no maas call today - the guys are away it seems
correct . the inode is cleared , so the metadata is lost .
not a problem , do n't worry
are you getting step 2 right ? 2 . marvel as the ubuntu installer starts over the net .
but that 'll fail , because i updated snappy manually to point at the branch you mention
if you can do it that would be good , also i was unsure if we want this in wily
yeah : d
pull-lp-source should dtrt though
in the 90 's we would have called it a `` paradigm shift '' : )
we can updtae the page when it finds a new home
try : sudo apt-get purge nvidia-304 ; then : sudo apt-get install nvidia-346 ;
not even sure which part of that page might apply to the hp mini 1000
the silo has been landed and fully published afaict
it should list all the executables
first look - environs.networking should also include supportsaddressallocation
exactly
i must once again mention that kubuntu15.4 was the best look-and-feel gnu/linukka i 've ever used
make it so ( always wanted to say that )
i have no strong opinions about where it *should* be , but i suspect someone in # ubuntu-desktop could point
let me trigger that now
no , probably not . but you could just install xfce
the rest of the system might be hung up on trying to access that bad disk , so live sessions
wrt verify , i 'm +1 on most of it , but uncomfortable with growing the already-too-large part interface
i tried that and it did n't really work
type ls -- color=auto do you get colors ?
you 've just posted a ppa
i would say this can just go in as it is , but let 's double-confirm with jibel
otoh , i had no problem getting rid of the guest login option by creating /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf.d/99-no-guest.conf with [ seatdefaults ]
is it an ubuntu package ?
is yellow better than orange ? it 's a user preverence thing .
what did you suggest him to do exactly ? to delete the whole env or just the machine ?
thats not the command you have been told .
probably
easy enough to experiment by unpacking your initrd , chrooting in , and deleting files until name resolution breaks .
do you seek kubuntu support ?
i 've already explained why a secure ftp server is not insecure . please read up before making such comments
nope . just snd_hda_intel
how did that reject rules appear in iptables ? from libvirt ?
what irc client are you using ?
try sudo service lightdm start in the vt/command prompt
the thing is these guys love linux , the code is qt and so it could easily be used
so far as i know , with most recent releases , the only direct impact may be for ntp ,
and yes , those are very high priority because as you say the current five ca n't keep up ,
is the problem this : `` neither the name of the w3c nor the names of its contributors may be
you do n't , the quotation marks handle that
i do n't make up the rules : )
well , the laptop refresh is just money right ? if you can afford to spend now then you still
any progress in finding where the leak might be ?
i can keep sending you random guesses , thats all i 've been doing anyway
it might be worth pointing this out to whoever maintains the rodata.c file . there will probably be contact information
correction . `` sudo apt-get install smartmontools ''
i seem to remember there is an animating property , could be worth trying . like : object.animating.wait_for ( false
tried importing from the web ui ?
itunes random
and now the `` sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ''
trying to change the refresh rate , ubuntu seems to think it is 120hz , but it 's 60hz according
i doubt there is one maintainer for ubuntu
yes , cyphermox , infinity and i were working on that last week , and updated the list
ubuntu at this point is not booting right ? i am aware of your loss of w8 .
you get better iops with striped mirrors than with parity-based stuff
install libdouble-conversion1 before citrain
type sudo efibootmgr -c -w -l \\efi\\microsoft\\boot\\bootmgfw.efi -l `` ubuntu '' -p 1 -d /dev/sda
k , well before something were asking for my ssh credential in a nice ui and storing them : p
yep , it sure is !
probably < darkxst > larsu , broken ... apparently have a blood clot in my leg , but battling with
yeah : )
no , i mean that 's what it 's communicating with via dbus . perhaps i misunderstood the question ?
nope
ok . i just checked the silo results , did n't check previous runs .
yes - i guess that macro needs just to be documented . though what is currently shipped does boot a
but that 's for fde
whish i could purge it with hellfire
i 'll file a bug to get them updated
for what ?
my estimate is that it does n't like your kernel
i just told you read up mate
fresh install from this morning
honestly , there 's someone on here every day with the same problem
your wlan is eth1 ?
sadly , no . if it were my game , yes .
what is the line in fstab ?
if you have forgotten the password then you 've lost the files . that is the whole point of encryption
the `` oneline '' flavor is in 1.21
well right now authentication fails , and it could be failing due to not being able to maintain a connection
yea , it really is . i suppose you could argue that it has it 's good points , but
well , i intend to file an unblock for the sysvinit upload i did to jessie , unblocking both together
makes sense
5.2 beta is tagged tomorrow
you patched what ? how ?
i will try your ultimate boot cd
snappy service is wrong ; check `ps -ef|grep gopaste`
ping under linux runs infinitely .
my install script has done a lot
i 'd recommend using ufw if you do n't need anything special
it sounds pretty similar to the qt problem - it first setups build dependencies from release pocket , then enables
ftr , i 'm off for 2 or 3 hours , checking irc tonight again
mmm maybe they 're not out yet ?
cool . needs an upstart job + removal on the image builder
that seems to have fixed the boot problem
because we do n't need it woith a traditional menubar
but what would start the shipped units then ?
i reluctantly agree with you and tvansteenburgh
see if there 's an updated mirror for the software in question
its uefi
i 'm guessing something happened prior to this install to break dpkg
what card do you have ?
to get rid of it entirely we 'd have to check the build type in each of those
2.6.32 ? ? what on earth ...
no .
has unity been improved ?
dropbox should have a setting in preferences to prevent this
i dont know . i never needed to do so using cds , i am using a pxe server for
i highly doubt we have an 8086 emulator in glibc though ( in fact , i 'm sure we do
but that means more changes to the package itself
sorry , no op privileges here : /
no , on the spreadsheet
i see what you mean . it does seem to include its own copy of the code
so that test passes for me
it is . i 'm installing ubuntu for a friend . old feller .
ok just do n't hit build yet because it 's not quite finished
and if i remember correctly ( from android/cyanogenmod powered galaxy s2 times ) sync of contacts and other phone info
oh ?
not yet
add one !
definitely unreleased . if you set anything else , the train will make a new changelog entry which will just
i do n't
no hurry , enjoy !
how are they 'weird ' ?
check .cache/upstart/unity8-dash.log
ooh that should be useful
there 's no version of the stdlib that does n't have the encoding package , though
development one
since qa mentioned that webbrowser has really really broken tab functionality with 1.7.3 , so i hoped this fix might
it does n't *have* to be this pr , but would you do a followup then ?
no idea what that is . is that a gnome thing ? i do n't think i 'm running gnome..
i 'll call the branch lp : ~developer-ubuntu-com-dev/developer-ubuntu-com/snappy-docs-import , so we can both work on it and add mps for
i 'm resurrecting my wolfe nodes for the umpteenth time now , which keeps reminding me about cloudifying those :
vlc-player has that level of control
you can always ask in # ubuntu-mate , but keep in mind that lts is more stable
you 'd have to take a look at your syslog when it fails and see what 's hanging
the ufr file contains `` 64-bit_driver/debian/ '' directory with .deb files in it ; have you installed those ?
not app spread
well you can download ubuntu to that and make up the flash drive there too
if it asks for a partition its that one { /dev/sd ? ? } otherwise use the disk { /dev/sd
if i find proof that i asked for a flight in may , i could prove to the travel agent
and that debian in ppas bug , i do n't even know how to begin with that , so meh
all i know is it works just dandy : )
okey , sorry
indeed .
that is weird ! maybe the file format there is different then . can you `` pastebinit < ( tail
huh ...
ok , make it yours
yes it 's ubuntu server 14.04
so you just help people .
sorry needed coffee . that 's def a big problem . is it obvious whose backlog it would exist on
ok , i 'll have a look shortly
if they 're detected , they 'd appear in dmesg . you could try modprobing the ath modules manually ,
but that 's a different question
im going to install now
when will it happen where xenial gets it first ? or does someone have to do that
oh ok
do you have a dns entry for that server ?
did you restart okteta ?
conectate a ubuntu-es o enviame un privado
pretty much opera 17 and up , up to 31 now , looks almost like google chrome , with an
yes , and no
but i see songs grouped in albums
yeah i just noticed it now..sry . i am reflashing my phone clean to see if everything is okay .
no idea as i do n't do ! mint . sorry . you know who to ask ...
really ? i was n't aware of that . well , that 's an option then , but i would
change your password now
the open-sourced mesa driver for amd cards
we can add some time to prevent that
the only bios setting i see is virtualization
did you install ubuntu with ethernet cable and updates during setup ?
oh , so in promulgate you have to first promulgate the published url .
well , so , i had a work item to support loading images from files on disk ( a la
jetbrains
that is the basework , yes . but there are now a lot more packages that are added to that
ubuntu is ignoring it . but you can ignore it too . afaik , there _isn't_ a functioning fsck.btrfs yet
ah , ok
are you sure ? i ca n't find any documentation about it , even one ! : )
hmmm , ok so if that worked it means the redirects are broken ...
but package.el works so well i honestly do n't miss any of the debian packages
also , fyi , my system here is an intel i7 processor , an intel/amd hybrid card , an intel
yes
did you browse the software center.. ?
yeah
stuck in what way ? ... must be a qt bug : p
woah , it 's pushed the background off the screen
192.168.100.22
does your soundcard show up in 'lspci ' ?
no , since how does the non-persistent usb magically knows where the persistent data is to be found ?
except for the bit about all tests failing
nothing is reseted
it is easier to pull the changes forward
yes plese , help : )
my pleasure .
and how 'll that be noticed in the shell ?
i ca n't tell if it 's up , since i ca n't ssh in to it and did n't
once that lands you probably want the changes in devices-api-maas . hopefully it will result in less $ $ stupidtests
?
yeah ... and leaves the bad dvd in the drive and thinks the new hdd has also failed : d
uh oh - got worse after all ? sorry to hear
he emailed the list
adueppen : all set
so , improve-viewer and content-hub have to be reviewed , right ?
you can compile it from source , as shown on that page you linked .
get a link to something in your bucket that 's accessible to public ( permission-wise )
so particularly with manual source packages like you 've copied in , jenkins is really doing nothing at all .
that is not at all feasible
sphinx provides it 's own css , that i ca n't use in it 's entirety because then the site
and even once all those processes are killed , the memory will remain unusable until reboot ?
mhm , good
i wonder if it would make sense to force a refresh and retry if the version is not found
lol , sure you 're allowed
most use whatever the default is for their distro
wrong channel
sure-ack
that 's why i asked if you are looking for an admin of this network or not : - )
beuno : yeah , my mistake
excellent idea ! riddell , would you have time to look at the kscreen 5.3.2 autopkgtest failure , or consider
no i did n't , but i could try it
k thx
... rbenv ?
just that .
hold back please
that 's really trivial , but that would be the one benefit of getting rid of the 5 packages that
sorry which one ?
: )
there should be a lot fewer jobs be in `` start waiting '' now
type apt-cache policy update-manager-core
suggestion : install 14.04 for 5 years of long term support and stop upgrading just because a new version comes
but that is not normal . did you try with sudo ?
you know that if you guys need me , i 'm here to give you a hand
yes it was ctrl x or f10 for me i choosed f10 lol
ok , type dpkg -l | grep fglrx
basically i 'd like to know what will break when upgrading to the silo 16 ppa ( see email )
with containers i can do what i asked for ?
are you fixing that or should i ?
as in open with from another application to yours
what client are you using to connect to this host ?
ok so can say gparted shrink partition and then i add what size of swap . i do n't want
its , as explained , the first letter.. if you are using a different application , or language , please
well , but it 's letting you in before things are ready
all versions of ubuntu will work fine with a single processor .
once we can do deployments within a single space reliably , it should n't be much of a problem do
nope
no , the partitions before it
thats what i did ?
btw this is an imac running osx so there is no help for me .
bzr yes
because there 's no proper eject tool aside from udisks ?
it takes some time to export all of the files , so it needs to be asynchronous . so it
also $ dpkg -s indicator-datetime to get the version of the datetime indicator
when you have the camera plugged into the computer and camera powered on , with the computer powered off ,
i would be willing to disable raid and use that as a backup if that 's possible
ok , so i have tried again and it is listed as `` offline '' . i can change the
maybe not for us ; )
you can use libreoffice
is it urgent ?
not the one i 'm using . hello-world.elopio .
you could use a rectangleboxbody for the blocks
ok
here is what my 1g os-admin-network interface looks like on my compute node
press ctrl+alt+t
that 's super inconvenient , i 'd really rather not do that if it 's not for a good reason
when we master cds , we copy that out to `` initrd.lz '' on the iso , so our cd
last time it hung on the splash screen .
i hope you ate all those monsters quickly at home : )
so glad its not my router
fuck off ... you talked sdb thru something in the manual and you give me incompetence ? ? ? yeah
no worries .
is your ultimate goal to create a ppa ?
so i should first run 'ufw reset -- force ' ?
well i tried to use oxygen-sans on this fresh 15.04 install but they are very hard on my eyes (
seems like it 's a code or compiler issue , not a bsd or linux issue ( same error ,
quick offtopic , how do i work with staging launchpad with 2fa , i can not log in to change
seems it might be caused by unetbootin
done it 's everything before syslog 1
ok : )
although debian tries to stay on top of 1.9.x when they do follow the mainline releases
i will also probably need git , bzr , and xz-utils ( if they are n't already there )
yeah getting there
what is the software to configure an epson nx230 's wifi ?
15.04
cool.. share details.. i can.. i enter the address in the browser , and i get cups
`` ex sublime '' does not tell me how you create files in a specific folder .
you have to wait until bq releases their stuff
i 'd like to setup a network for my maas - and i 'd like you to help if you

it is a nasty hack to activate a nasty hack and breaks all the time . if you 've been
no , it 's a simple python gtk app , indicator
which is free an easy ?
any of them with a timestamp that matches the crash time ?
and you can see the categories there , or even set any new ones if you wish , but you
^
^^
seems to be installed now
dno't forget that the limits set via the pam_limits module will only affect whatever login mechanisms are configured to use
heh
so we 'll need a method on environs.networking i guess - createsubnet ( eventually , for now it can be
sure , if it stays like that , that libusermetrics is all we need , it 's not needed to
knock it off .
thx
though , i have also been messing with android virtual machine via genymotion lately , and maybe that is a
correct
14.10 is eol , no longer supported , suggest you install 14.04lts since it 's still still long term support
it 's a somewhat outlandish idea , no worries about knocking it down . but if i was billing i
so did you identify the volume name on this other disk ?
have you tested it on wily ?
unless you install some access control list ( acl ) stuff it 's really a little less sophisticated than windows
ack , let me run the test here and shell into it
nope , it 'd make it crash since 10 . * are internal addresses
he said 'sudo apt-get install dconf-tools ; dconf reset -f /org/compiz/ ; unity -- reset-icons ; setsid unity
yeah it 's not critical , the servers kills iterators after 10mins of inactivity anywayu
no
not yet .
the only thing they 're good for , is taking pictures above crowds
yeah , i would doubt you 'd see a -ac adapter working full speed right now
in this particular case it is useless , but we have also tests for incoming calls that show the dialog
one point of clarification : teamparticipation is the transitive closure of approved and admin teammemberships .
so frustrating
oh haha -- i thought you were saying someone named sse was making a unity8 scope , but you 're
is n't that for the busybox shell ?
you can click on mimize on the window
and that package is already in our vivid sources ; - )
where are they hiding ?
he refactored the wallpaper bits into a separate component
do you know how qa.kubuntu.co.uk works ?
i wonder if it was caused because d-i asked me if i wished to 'force ' the installation to be
hum , are you sure ? it seems rather than it ca n't import _gi ?
approved that branch
yeah from the threads i 've seen it does n't really seem like there 's a solution
i have a webserver project , and it is source code is in a github project . is it possible
by mounting via the fstab file , can i just put in the paramters in mount options under the disks2
rm -r
again ... software is never finished ... that 's implied : -p
not using that , but i know it 's a tool for the job .
how do i do that ?
wise choice : )
running an emulator on a virtual system ? : /
/me too , digging deeper and adding more logs ( have to remove them afterwards , phew )
vps for school , zero budget .
have you run apt-get update & & apt-get upgrade ?
hm , systemd is not available in 1.22
i 've always poked infinity directly in the past when i 've wanted a package removed from the future ,
i 've updated the ka clone , and ran it again . i see those changes are not pushed yet
3.14 gtk ?
if i push new wallpapers to lp : xubuntu-artwork , you 'll take care of reviewing and uploading , right
well known by whom ?
it may not have any affect until lightdm is restarted .
are you subsribed to the loco-contacts mailing list ?
no , sorry , that is not correct
i will wat for battery depletion
the how can i fix that ?
ok - that 'll help i suspect
no it 's not going to work
you were asking about gnome 3.14 , what do you really want ?
rsalveti : i have no opinion . go ahead with what you think is right .
sounds like you 'd be better off with a vm in virtualbox
yeah , guess i 'll do that ... then we 'll rely on the bot to do the merge again
oh , i did n't intentionally choose py2 here , sorry
many systems just run tcsh when you ask to run csh
i 'm on 6.3 now
i 'm in
sms , calls and alarms that all trigger osd bubbles
you could try installing libdb5.3 first , then retry
most certainly - it does n't have a traditional menu bar right now , does it ?
oh weird . i would n't expect that preference : ) why ?
ah , i messed up
its really not playing
i 'm not in commercial-admins , so ca n't do it myself . wgrant may still be around , otherwise
nearly all calculators come with a % button and i just noticed we did n't have one so thought i
the one on the page
but can i sync it ?
type chown root : /etc/sudoers
or tail -f /var/log/auth.log
sure .
sure , but doing expect by default is no good
i see many people with this problem , so we can assume not a hardware fault
ooo nice , and will you be able to make them optionally ring like an alarm ?
try again . that sounds like a bad username or password
does your gnome-session crash ?
i expect a combination of both behaviours , to be fair . ; )
: when the interface has an ip , it has the route . when it does not have an ip
you are on plasma 5.2 beta ?
could you paste the last lines from the command `` dmesg '' which are relaed to this /dev/bb ... .
well , you never liked the services framework , and it turned out that everyone else agreed with you .
indeed , it 's been happening for a while now
your decision .
yes sure ... i will upgrade to 14.10 and then to 15.04
the lock is there to ensure that only one package management process is managing packages at a time , otherwise
yeah oddly it was n't in there , it should be right ?
oh you need -proposed
it happens because i 'm not using a local user but a network one
heh sie kommt aus deutschland ? ; )
do n't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly ; if nobody knows your answer , nobody will answer you
and i 've left you some : )
could be , what version of webbrowser-app do you have ?
just saying you could look at that package for seeing how it is done
wand did n't work , had to use keyboard
*nod* no problemo , certainly no hurry on finding out about manual photo additions - cheers : )
and i guess all the uefi confusion was because we never migrated to the beta ppa
the other issue i have is that the login screen is messed up
ask away !
are you merging from his branch ?
ymmv , etc .
excellent tool for testing disk perf
what are you running ?
done
come on.. : p
we can see that later on , right now we would like to start our meeting
maybe lightdm.log ?
ok , type sudo cfdisk /dev/sda
okay , go new file or project > ubuntu > `` app with qml extension library ''
it should be ! i have an 8600gt with the same driver and it does n't have any issues

do you have the scroll back to see when i left irc last night ?
still seems like an odd runaround , since i assume lp has knowledge of the keys somewhere anyway .

trying to look at elinux.org but it seems down
i just get a weird error message
yes it does
so you guys are , obviously . i 've heard kubuntu muttering about it and it affects us , too
the project you wish to merge into has to exist to get a mp button .
are you able to enable proposed and check if that helps ?
some businesses have `` requirements '' and i am paid to provide those requirements . if they paid me to

no

you 've seen the uefi wiki , you just seem lost in general is all ?
or actually as you know there is a white out , you could just rsync and let them get lost
ubuntu version and card chipset ?
difference being , krusader is very customizable , with user actions , you can add your actions to the toolbar
but tomorrow is fine
you dont `` like '' me ? anyways.. im only here to provide volunteer support , and help provide factual
not what i said
ah . the conventional approach is to declare a credentials file , stored in /root/.smbpass and set that to 400
ta
sudo apt-get install ufw
i hope the chinese meizu phone is a roaring success , but do n't anticipate a lot of the chinese
could use owa
( works with windowas as well and is more than 1 tb )
oh
or the log viewer icon from your programs
you want me to log a bug anywhere ?
you can try a firmware of those yes
what is your end goal here > if you have a supported release of ubuntu , there is a path
well plasma is running fine here ; what makes you think the problem is pa ?
( up early , or in a different tz ? )
i just did that and i find no traces of netbeans
unfortunately it 'd be hard to reproduce *all* of my actions leading to this point but i can get logs
no idea , never tried it .
let me check that - i just flipped it to use xinerama ( seeing as i know that 's at
that are instructions . read it !
and the fix has not landed yet
and someone will assist you with updating your linux kernel because i ca n't go any further
can you take things from here ? i 've got a bit of work stacking up
afaik persistence is n't needed for any of that
my priority is to make translations work and have all of the scaffolding in place , so we can show
it does need python3-wand
ok well do what you can . if you can only test 240 then so be it . when the

i 'm pendantic , it 's what makes my sites so good ; - )
try sudo find / -size +100g
like shutdown or reboot .
juju bootstrap -- constraints arch=amd64 || true
maybe jumps out if the interface is a bond , too
i could help if you linked a branch to the bug : )
it 's in debian patches , not ubuntu patches !
hello !
by 3 people
if you could , that would help - i do like to be as precise as possible ( its for
which folder are you talking about ?
haha , well , i only have good ideas every two or three years . ; )
lol ...
like , it really bothers me on a deep and personal level ; - )
it tells me no upgrade is available .
man , you really like to argue for the sake of arguing ( and of winning arguments ) . but
ok i enabled it
there is , unity7 still uses nm-applet
it means that your package failed an automated test when it was in wily-proposed , which is preventing it from
tnx
that sounds promising ... how do i route to my device ?
select/test/reboot and good luck to you !
i meant , were you able to fix it : )
yeah , i did n't necessarily mean manually , but it would be disruptive no matter how it was done
snort ( source : snort ) : flexible network intrusion detection system . in component universe , is optional .
... rioting after the game .
is that like nyancat with slower music ?
still does n't explain why the systemd-timesyncd.service is sometimes started , but well , i 'll get that to ``
how i send you it ?
: -d
np
you can tweak telephony-service into allowing other protocols by registering them at /usr/share/telephony-service/protocols/
is n't it already mounted at /media ... . ?
i 'm seeing a *lot* of reports in the dell forums about disappearing nvidia gpus
phablet-screenshot , from the phablet-tools package from the ubuntu-sdk-team ppa
bfiller : yup , you can can flash later on without erasing your personal data
hmm no , not that one . it was some unofficial frontend
yes sir
hmm , on my disk ... let me dig it up and push somewhere
i use 10.x.x.x on my network - granted i have about 15 vlans and 4 wireless networks ( also vlan
i selected use ubuntu without installing and now it is locked on a page with ubuntu in the middle and
what 's this for ?
while i agree on principal , i also agree with the phone developers that having a handful of python interpreters
that 's ok
so rebuild ?
and the user can have their own setting for that saved in accountsservice
osomon : yeah one of our goals is to expand user empowerment so that you guys are n't waiting for
that 's what *all* our apis are doing anyway : )
i dont think there was one
that would be something we 'd expect would work
basically if you dnd to a folder with a > 100 % zoom level , the destination folder icon switch
unity-scope-click is passing now . will take another look at ubuntu-touch-meta next
it all depends on your configuration . probably not a basic ubutntu troubleshooting question .
15.04 worked well for me too
it 's so by default
^ that 's the output in rolling/edge : )
looking
i 'll download the patches and check again later i guess
perhaps try # mysql - i do n't like mysql - it 's a pain - use postgresql if you
open command prompt . nslookup -
have a great dream : )
give them a call .
it will if you take your insuline , just not as quickly
that 's fine if i have to remove it from 1 or 2 servers , but what if i am
gotcha
forwarding your appreciation for the keyboard to elleo , developer and maintainer : )
i 'm not not home yet but i can have a proper look in about 2 hours
you said you lost sound after update . maybe try reinstalling the amd drivers ( ? ) . having said
dimitern : i just feel like that 's an unreasonable restriction in a complex network environment
what stat does the ping on windows show ?
even though the account has been created and permission granted ?
there are similar qs over there but no useful answers so i thought it might be less helpful to post
hawkeye
would you like a body bag for spawn` : d
crontab running , cron running
no , you can have smm with bios as well .
i have n't managed to pick out the exact cause , but my bet is that , although most of
alright , published for rtm , green light for the new device tarball and new custom
there 's also tbb ftbfs on arm64
that was in the bios settings
yep
generally , yes . honestly , my personal machine has been living with both libraries for a while and it
yes
and sda3 should be ext4 with mountpoint `` /home ''
yeah gettting there now
if so , shipping where ?
you can look at /sys/class/net/eth0/statistics/ for a more detailed breakdown , `` dropped '' is a bit ambiguous because it
maybe invest in a multimetre , you can get a cheap working of the shelf one for about r60 at
oh : / i did n't think to check where it comes from..
sometimes they dont send them out as quick when you do it online , so i always just called them
i do plan to bring the ubuntu and debian locale packaging a bit closer together , so it 's less
not yet
oh i do have it indeed lol it really frustrate me to see my dear old buddy like that x
ubottu is the bot . please read its messages .
ok , so no show-stopper
we tried installing the package in mention on a -proposed enabled chroot and everything seems to be fine , but
yay , you 'll never leave us ! ; )
better do n't : )
\o/
if you want the library paths then simply `` javac -verbose -cp . dummy.java '' will get you data you
yes , which i hate : (
type man cp
# ubuntu+1 til it is released ( see channel motd )
ok , giving it a try
yeah but i still need a manager to manage 2 linux + 1 windows
so for test one only would have to mock the according smaller one
i know : ) , i 'm trying to get him to google it on his own : p
yes . yes . yes . yes . i have said yes to this many times already .
you can change tty
i 'd like it if we do n't share by default , but mark seemed keen on the idea
i had many problems with the nvidia drivers it still does n't detect my card it says unknown but works
well i really did n't have a problem , i was just fishing to see how that emulator runs on
sorry . wrong program .
yeah , it totally has ! someone just hit it on the mailing list . i 've always just removed
not opinions : )
not while i was there do n't know about now
mount the ubuntu drive over the network
also system monitor you can sort processes to see if any are spiking the cpu . it may not be
could you tell me the package name where its code is located ? i 'd like to see the source
well it is hard to say as i can not see you doing anything which looks like asking
i need the ... upstart session
i turned on smart from bios
what version of postgres do you need ?
yes , i use elementaryos which is based on ubuntu trusty if that helps .
i 'll see what i can do
i 'm doing a quick live test first and then will update the pr 's description and ask for reviews
did you registered your nick ?
hi ; )
so lp : unity8 is for vivid overlay then . then which unity8 branch is for wily ?
ah ok..ack
yes .
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
bash : /home/anon/desktop/tor-browser_en-us/start-tor-browser : permission denied anon @ ubuntu : ~ $
it 's irrelevant to the bug . the bug is that there are additional packages that are unexpected . that
of course . so does microsoft , and the nsa
as i understand it yes ... read the wiki though
and maybe curtin , like i said . and who knows what else .
from a branch you click the 'create packaging recipe ' button
yeah , not supported . you can install the 14.04 enablement stack in precise
i spotted nothing else but i will look again in a bit .
nvm then
what about putting it in the index.json file ?
cool - if you 're happy to +1 it , i can take care of merging
you can find the full list of devices , official images , community images , and works in progress at
then opened new terminal windows , and tried typing `` but nothing new . did it work for u ?
are n't the runtimes interchangable anyway ?
ok , it is just that the error message is not precise , as i am authorized to upload it
so knowing what you are trying to achieve is important .
but you seem to not get that error
no , 16.04 will be lts
enter grub at boot with holding shift
what card is this ? that 's not always the best way to install drivers .
ok : `` pastebinit < ( cat /var/log/xorg.0.log ; cat $ home/.xsession-errors ) ''
at least in this case an exit code is sufficient . oh , in that case i do n't understand
no optical drive indeed . why not just boot through the thuderbolt + ssd into ubuntu ?
they type is partition and the name is sda1
i do n't think it is a problem with the usb and ubuntu image
thats not what i want . i just want the plugin multiple keyboards , mice , monitors on my existing
at 00:00 hours ?
another idea , can i just sound the alarm without displaying notification ?
i do n't have one . o.o ;
you are on kubnut-ci or something ?
if it 's kmail then i have no clue
irc you didnt answer the last time , why the gcc-backport was n't done in a more general way which
90 % of symbian device do n't have external sdcards so that argument does n't wash either : p
yes , service apache2 restart
like i just said , linux mint is not on topic here . go ask them in their channel ,
i mean when i try to log into the phone
looking
it all depends on the game
what is the error ?
i 'm trying to install cacti , i 'm having trouble with mysql 's 'root ' password - i never
as far as i know yes
but you just worked with html too ; )
but that 's delving into a non-ubuntu thing , so if you have real questions like that about android you
also , crappy internet connection . that live cd is 11h away ...
i was thinking about that too
check boxes are broken too
for general talk there is # ubuntu-offtopic
np
no , i use 64-bit
brave soul
also , when i do the select boot device , my usb is listed under both `` uefi boot sources
i find it easier to downloand music on itunes , instead of on my device
that is true .
you are on the lts i guess ?
alright , done
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
already done
everyone has done that at least once . so -- - all things are good now ?
but if you 're going to block on this i can change the if to do whatever you want
what is the status of the two disabled ppc64el buildds ? besides being disabled
any idea when ?
one thing which seems to be the same in v and t is that maybe we should tweak the default
if someone replies 'yes ' , then it becomes socially difficult to ignore you afterwards .
if you 're still around can you review the reflash mp for me please ?
o/
ca n't help , the idiots made the app to work on root account . i will change this but
i can try to reboot the machine and see if the kernel panics and mount errors have been resolved
doesn an older kernel work in grub ?
but that 's all we in ci have control over : )
just a reminder though , if you have things that ship new features there should be a feature freeze exception
i do if you 're giving bad information
the # ubuntu-server guys might also know tricks
hmm , i ran your command on ../build-area
i 've never read enough of the details to know . gim me a minute
yup , thx
just a local one i have setup
i know , again
we wherent expecting you for a couple of weeks
sorry . confused..
nice !
what ?
you can already add the properties as the third parameter for addpageto { next , current } column
not good , but things are about to get better
but there is a lot more like kernel-headers that is installed too
welcome back ! we missed you
kwallet will open automatically when you use the same password as login ( if i 'm not mistaken here )
that dooes n't mean iit gets to see mongo
: )
ok , try sudo cat /var/log/gdm/:0.log | nc termbin.com 9999
irc is not twitter . but it is ubuntu support , so no more offtopic chat please
i 've zero idea . mir uses c++14 , so needs relative new compiler . and it 's mesa side
i am there ...
you are new , right ? then use ubunt
it is possible .
# ubuntu-offtopic for shopping advice please
i do n't see any change
that would still happen before . it 'd just have gone through the txn loop twice
there 's also a bug about shotwell being unable to share pics to facebook , it 's probably about api
please also run 'sudo systemctl enable sddm '
and you ?
have a good weekend . : )
obviously i 've written those tests before completely reworking the editnoteview ... should n't be too hard to fix them
which command is that ?
which one
unity8-desktop-session-mir provides the file /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/55-unity8.conf that tells lightdm what to do , which is basically run /usr/bin/lightdm-unity8-session
working on the bug atm
hmmm okay they are indeed different
haha
i know i will ask him later
that was not my question
tapping back on the messaging app should go back to address book , right ?
juju-gui then dies
i waited for it for hours , and nothing
are you using standard ports ? are you forwarding to a server from your router etc etc
are you opening /dev/console to read or write ?
oh wow ! what in the hell ... why it records in auth.log is ... not smart on snoopy 's
nagios is one of the only topics i 'm quite versed on , so maybe i 'll come in handy
does that usb stick have a ubuntu installer on it ?
i use cfdisk and love it ! what is your cfdisk output ?
yes , it 's tempting to put new good stuff in , but that does n't keep the bug fixes
im a newbie
a vmware install would have the same as a physical install
wrt bug 1479711 ... do you think we should backport it to 15.04 ?
but the chroot mounts wo n't go away with a reboot
yes , in essence that 's the only thing i do . its packaging is a fork , but mostly
i dont understand what you are doing there and what the ubuntu issue is right now
ltsp sounds like one option
it 's 1 more powers than 10
( we have # u-o for chit-chat , of course )
ouch , what kind of internet speed do you have ?
as is all ports under 1024
no , but it 's likely we can find the offending debs in /var/cache/apt/archives/
that is not really useful for someone that switches distro 's though
agreed , but that will be dependent on volunteers porting to new devices
why stay only half broken of we can be completely broken ...
i would make note of your fstab beforehand
yeah . he mentioned a couple of weeks hiatus , a couple of weeks ago : )
software cancer as it appears after my session starts , does not appear in guest session
can you please explain to me why you were banned in the first place ?
and i would make sure to check the md5sum of the iso .
let rephrase with proper spellings befor you copy
yeah , i tried that and got :
are you going to be online much later tonight ? ( was machst du heute nacht ? : ) )
i mean without stripe ?
sure
please file a bug next time . irc bug reports tend to get mistranslated apparently : )
cheers
it could be the firewall of your machine , or the firewall of the network you are currently in
not right now
yep , df -i shows /usr is 100 %
no , must be in a lebanon
not for production , internal use/sandbox
one thing is that we expect the first boot of an updated system to take a while
can you get the whole of dmesg off by copying it to a usb stick ?
otherwise pkg-config only looks in /usr/lib/pkgconfig/ , and there is n't much there
good luck !
i 'd like to understand how that interacts with staging , e.g . a in incremental build process ( librarya
i did it but when i see by date command they are not the same even the timezone
you can not resize that easy .
ship it !
are you using encryption ?
do you have an amazon account ?
the developer does not explain in detail how exactly his program works
did you check that you 're indeed booted in uefi mode ? ls -ld /sys/firmware/efi ?
ubuntu installs a uefi based system if you boot the installer via uefi , and a bios bases system if
well , i installed the package , but it still shows everything in plain text .
not really , sparingly at best
it starts from scratch every time
osd ?
i tried to figure that out yesterday . intel chip 7series or something like that
quite new to ubuntu
ok , i 'll add a test that results in the dialog more than once , to see if we
please file a bug about that

it 's an app ?
yes .
you 've got the info - job done , you appeared to be continuing to ask the info
sure , makes sense to me . sorry to bother you , it 's muscle memory : - )
and it does require training before using , otherwise all core-devs would be able to spoil all silos .
version 0.1 no , version 0.1.1 yes
this is even easier ; it 's basically a plain-text outline that you just export
you mean 'n ' as in b/g/n ?
( things have changed ... . : )
ack , added to the bug
i did the same for the last two landings.. robru told me that leaving the version empty will force the

do you have an oops id ?
north america ipv4 stock is |empty|
yea it does , seems a bit too much , prefix + [ is there a way to change that
on that device ?
as long as you understand that new disk volume wo n't be protected by raid
well , man-db is part of the standard image , and it is installed on all non-minimal installs .
so you can browse them logs
as mentioned , grub.cfg is the real config script for grub . grub does n't care about /etc/default/grub , but
possibly property watcher only works from container ... .
from where
in fact the moderation says it probably got disgarded , sorry about that

it 's being paranoid , and rightly so , by design . clear the offending keys and let it recreate

that 's sucky
xvfb-run ?
how many boxes would you have installed trusty on yet ?
`` systemd-analyze set-log-level debug '' , and watching the journal while you plug in the battery might be insightful
ok . i also posted it on kde-apps-announce
to go along with pavlos the idea with using a live distro is that you dont have pre-defined information
and as far as i can tell the results of calling broker.startinstance do n't include network details to check
right ; that is a bit of an anachronism
yep .
i 'm installing firefox with wine to check if it 's the same over there .
please put a `` sudo fdisk -l '' ( small l at the end ) into a pasteservice
yeah , that 's a wrapper provided by qemu-kvm ; just oneliner to wrap qemu-system ...
time
i 'm aware of the infrastructure . the problem is that it will not be any `` better '' than
fastboot recovery : ok , library copied in /custom : ok
so ?
hm i 'm not so sure . maybe its some other bug . this is just what i remember
i did n't say shout ; )

linux-image-hwe-generic-trusty points to something with utopic in its name

sorry , missed you . no problem , i 've added another question about that branch , it 's basically
most of it looked vaguely reasonable , though i did n't realize this was also unsticking a mess of haskell
if what you were running is something from an ubuntu supplied package , you could install the -dbg package for
why are you insisting that the expected behaviour is a bug ?
now report this : `` pastebinit < ( iwconfig wlan0 ; sudo iwlist wlan0 scan ) ''
you can try that one i suggested for lv2's.. or , you can try using ardour/qractor

congrats on starting a build just in time before train apparently went down or something.. getting service unavailable

nope
if a triac blows , there is a failure somewhere else too , is n't it ?
i ran the command as root , and the vpn still did n't connect

will it work even if i have almost everything else installed via apt-get ?
yes , we 've got the new page and the videos page in there for release
wrong version
indeed
but i can see it making sense for a router or something . keep it up-to-date and secure
right - and unlike linux , windows is very picky aobut how it was syarted
windows 7 professional ( all i know ) and i made a system image on an external hard drive
currently it needs to be bundled in your charm
in the end , yes
so your choices are ( a ) do n't rebuild ( b ) use a different ppa ( c )
oh
sorry to tell you what you already know then . : )
how are you quitting ?
ah ok. so maybe consume that initial event in watchleadershipsettings ?
what is on that cd ?
there 's an automatic- > trunk going through landing right now

right , and i 'm rsyncing over the home dirs now so you 're just in time : )
and in a not-so-far future ( couple months , i 'd say ) , you will also have a javascript

so it does not plug and work in ubuntu , does it in another os ?

kinda feared that . i 've already started looking into using kvm with pci passthru but it 's daunting
shall i install pastebinit ? and what is it for ?
libunity-api-dev , right ?
did you use a pass phrase on the certificate ?
i would go to software & updates 2nd tab other software and untick every ppa , than run a update
i see
1 ?
sure i did
hmm , maybe some have already been done
on a full install keyring is used still , so whats the actual popup
correct
can you tell me what does this mean of diff output ? 802a803,804 > 2 > 5
i do not have a jenkins login
well , maybe not . the first 2 make it and check ok. the 3rd check , which is to
set user to your actual user name
ok , and what launches that ?
then you probably didnt . its a concious thing
after that , you can use 64bit programs .
you 're using deployer revision 151 , right ?
vmware basicly asumes that everyone is running an old rhel version
try username : amy on that f1 screen
you sure you want wily and not dual ?
i could , and that works . but that does n't check if i screwed something up in packaging .
is there an authorized_keys file in your .ssh directory on server 2 ?
you can do that for any of the clicks in that directory on the website
in fact it will be ignored : )
i mean , samsung does on their galaxy s6
ah , ok , since i was wondering if actually backing up sd support will help
well , i am sure it was fun engineering , so i am not worrying !
yes nvidia gtx 860m
i could create and instance , patch , and just re-run the part of the scipt that consumes the metadata
i have a fix for that i believe .
because if you say it happens when starting a *service* , then something else is wrong

with
sounds like a plan
unlikely ... only files that changed get touched during upgrade ... it is unlikely that file changes between two images
2mbs ?
i was making one
pastebin /var/log/xorg.0.log
or we 're on different uitk versions - let me install the latest staging
nice : - )
hope someone will answer ; )
does n't look like a disk issue to me
i was talking to sitter yesterday about taking over the social media accounts
curiously , b'\x80\xff ' * 250 ( or any lower value ) works fine
ok , try to sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
then that should be enough .
^^
yes . check with the folks in # playonlinux on how to get it set up properly , it can
typo
then join elementary os and help me there ... or per pm
funny i did n't see it . but that 's good news ; - )
yes , it 's that
its definitely a sipping bourbon
especially if yo'ure using zfs on a dataset , you probably just get to zfs export dataset ... and the
what 's the output of lspci -v
i 've approved , but please review too , aprove too and then top approve
well i 've made some porting attempts in my spare time in the past
the fact that swap starts to be used suggests fragmentation may be part of the issue , if not all
yeah , i merged it into this , that 's why ( so the view is nicer )
it does n't change the language of most softwares , as far as i know , only kde apps
cool , use # ubuntu-offtopic in future perhaps
it 'd probably be less pain : )
that 's fine i 'll test something else just give me a ping when 45 is ready for testing and
if the network stream is lagging behind the frame-rate that fully explains the laggy video . the issue appears to
share the music folder from the win7 computer and browse to it from the ubuntu box
grep -r . /run/network/ || true
as far as i know your kde settings will not carry over
fwiw , that 's also a compliment ! it means that xubuntu is quite good how it is . :
great
yeah as long as i am getting the help i want you are free to use me loool
sure but do we remove bzr to add git ?
ok
when you set visible to false , it would just disappear
the normal time
network manager in ubuntu
have you got an example of package that might/might not be chosen , and which you have in mind ?
i just asked someone with an e5 , and they got 2008
me neither what i am saying that battery now holds almost twice longer than before - i am not complaining
i have as i explained . and anything i try to do in that menu also fails .
'was ' being the operative word xd
i am trying to get an ark server running . it shows up on the lan but is unreachable from
yesterday i spoke with jordan_u and daftykins , we could n't get the install to work via uefi
did you set that to `` =y ''
if you do n't get an answer could you ask the question on askubuntu and i 'll get somebody to
yes , with the forum posts and all notes i 've taken today , i 'll try to complete it
biscotti al pomodoro : p : d
but i have rebooted nearly three times

lsblk : not found
the following packages will be upgraded :

in summary , the 386 tests fail on precise and trusty , and in hp and aws . that is
good idea
that 's why quickstart is trying to install juju-local , yes
yes , then reboot
the game is written in java but browser based
i see - i am now splitting up the bootcode on oem build and added it as raw-files with the
jenkins @ juju-osci-machine-7 : ~ $ apt-cache policy python-dns
the live cd ?
if it 's a machinetag , it 'll watch volumes scoped to that machine
its exploding : ( ?
but , do you recommend to install the proprietary driver ?
keep an eye out for an angry looking pony tail from america he 'll mostly be in black : d
i complained too fast . it 's done now .
currently that ^^ is the only way . i can add an option to force that page
sorry i do n't understand
that 's good . ( just finding that out on the website i just quoted . )
amazon links appreciated
they must be partitions formatted with linux file systems such as ext4
fixes for the 1.22-beta3 milestone should be based on 1.22 branch i presume ...
yeah , i read a lot of reports on g+ about the device immediately updating to r20 after people got
what you 're doing makes no sense
ok do you know where to do this after the logg ?
we will try to stop the service
scroll down to freepascal on that page
yes , intel
strategy is not scrum
doesnt matter its the same with regular fglrx from repos as well
thats not the entire output of dmesg .
as a workaround
okay , i can verify later today/early tomorrow . no worries
i 've gotten to the point , i would rather use the command line for things . system update :
if the files are n't there , they will be copied from default
but there 's nothing wrong with people using other linux distros
bdmurray said `` hey , they 're using the ppa '' maybe on the assumption that causes it ( because
we have this already - supportsaddressallocation - true for both release and allocate
if you do n't have one , then ctrl-alt-f2 and `` sudo restart lightdm ''
good idea , go for it : )
i might stick wily in the precise slot , to avoid the weekend .
so , if it 's simply very hardware specific , we can certainly test that and release it still .
ubuntu 15.04 ( vivid vervet ) will be the 22nd release of ubuntu due for release in april 2015 .
your numbers should be 143 143 176 143 143 in that order and `` is responding '' instead of ``
eh . okay , over my head . sorry
i 'll give that a try
right , so your suggestion was code , not a simple setting : ) since xfce is still gtk2 ,
ubuntu 15.10 , how do i get good readable output for driver version ?
press write , then exit
btw . what model of intel card you have ?
serious enough threat , ok !
sudo ppa-purge ppa : chris-lea/node.js
who is our resident app armor expert ?

is there any way to tell where a device tarball came from in a given image ?
you would do a manual install , this a uefi bios ?
but if this is generic code that 's also making its way back to debian , i agree , since
try ssh -y user @ host
add it to root 's crontab , crontab -u root -e
removing .overrides first should also work as a plug ... .
i just might go that route . i was thinking of doing that .
why would they do that if it was free software/open source ?
ok , try installing the amd driver
and freezes downloads over 10mb over ? might be ... but i do n't see a reason ...
nice !
i will join that mailing list ( if i do n't forget )
as i understand it , he wants ci to build the 1.22 branch next , so it 's ready to
the way to get fixed was going to use the lp bug system
woot !
what ? : p
haha i guess but the reply was amazing thou : )
unity7 and deb based distro will still be alive so having the ability to run snaps and clicks there will
ubuntu , with unity , requires 3d.. so , that will have compositing.. could be , you dont have 3d
oh , okay , i 'll take a look at grub-install ?
so what i do n't like about this is that the patch seems a bit invasive in an area where
autopkgtests failing on -5ubuntu1 ftw btw \o/
what if i simply delete the .backup file ?
so i 'm trying to repartition it and expand it . but i ca n't really do that : d
it 's actually just damn early for 16.04 .
i might come out to a chc someday
i see , does that not get writen to a text file too ?
she looks good
nope , packaging issue
if youre logged in as user , do `` sudo bash '' you got root access
i 'm surprised that you survived for so long without that
i 'm eod now . can we chat tomorrow ?
yeah that one i did
sounds like it 's game over then to me
easy fix ! revert to precise 's mplayer ; )
: )
would be nice if the sdk ran on other platforms , but it does n't right now
did you upgraded from prev versoin or it is fresh installation ?
clivejo i had to update the standards version thing in debian/control so you might have to too now
agreed .
+1
? ?
i 've tried xubuntu lubuntu , debian , and crunchbang all on this hardware . on a hdd and ssd
gon na look into that defnitely thanx
because before two days ago , none of the agents would have been able to access the api
ah , that explains it

i also have the idea that this could be extended to build multi arch snaps by creating sub folders per
well , it 's really just one `` adt-buildvm-ubuntu-cloud '' command away : )
let me know when you 've installed on your side , i 'll join in to test
sorry .
we can mark bug 1469199 as fix committed right ?
or is that anymore true that we should lands things also for wily ?
nevah !
hehehe : )
another one might be lp : message-app , but it 's mostly c++ iirc

right
the only attitude is you
excellent ! and buen provecho : )
does the poop really exist ?
check /var/log/upstart/ , there might be logs there
yea
why are you typing `` apt-get cache '' rather than `` apt-cache '' ?
the lines that i said , basically anything uncommented that does n't include `` trusty '' in them .
it will automatically use apt-cacher-ng
found a bug in the makefile : )
wan na do it ?
or under app/ subfolder of your click ?
python generally looks for some landmarks and crafts its default sys.path from those
well they 're not , that 's what it means to freeze : )
heh , no . i 've always used fpm when i wanted to do this .
well , i might get shot down for this , but have you tried debian ?
no seriously i need the machine to work on and i installed it with vivid when it came out and
never tried it myself .
if you get an m3u playlist , then parse the m3u and get the url from it
as i know what i expect there
did you install stuff you shouldnt ?
just do it how i suggested .
check your disks ...
oh looks broken.. maybe there was an abi break that was not detected.. because libsdl2 dynamically loads libmirclient
yeah , yeah . you first , where 's your patch ?
probably , but can you remind me the gist ?
maybe devilspie can help or compiz
no web shortcuts , apps only ; p
so that machine is practically idle . what 's the problem with it ?
you 'd rather confuse the user by letting them download things that when downloaded do not describe themselves as the

all the beers .
10.04 is server only support
good thing we 're just hours away from releasing 14.04.2 then .
absolutely not .
yeah merge/clean happens automatically after a successful publish
glad we got you sorted : )
ok , ef00 is already set and the entry was already correct , boot-repair removes the `` \ '' from
thats a good question for # # hardware , unrelated to ubuntu .
including ubuntu they all do it the same
yes that aplay command works when i am not running any application ( i.e . only desktop ) but if
so : fs0 : \efi\boot\bootx64.efi ?
hmm ... i walked away from 2 hours , came back and my remote host had closed the connection .
they can be lifesavers
generally you do n't `` add '' files to an archive , you simply create archives from directories .
do n't ask to ask , never ask to ask , just ask
ok. i 'm running an x86 build now in sbuild , if it works there then hopefully the armhf ones
i like to run the latest lts , but i still have a 12.04 image for regression testing .
since you are here . . . will there be a -phone version ? no real reason to package i
install a desktop package , ubuntu-desktop xubuntu-desktop etc .
... or distro-patch it
you should probably join the channel , # bitcoin .
no bootable device is detected .
right , so the issue likely lies with your profile . perhaps usefull to rename the .local/share folder .
`` sudo parted -l '' should show that info
yeah
is there another one ?
you ... ran out of space ?
ok - and that happens by default with a fresh install too ?
at least for location service and the other is just a bunch of little scripts and takes nearly no time
i am okay with having tech supporters in my circle of friends .
ok , good to know ...
also # ubuntu-app-devel is the channel for app dev discussion : )
yeah , indeed ... it was just , you know , not to be the only in list who does
nope , and yeah
it just sits there
you 're skimping on the info
is there any file i can paste to let you know how mta is configured ?
that does n't work either
yes because i have 2 repos , one own local repo with deb packages ( the issue is this have

you never installed chrome ? : p
accept that .
yes - the ppa seems to have 0.2.1 or 0.2.2 but for some reason my system has 0.1-0~135~ubuntu14.04.1

you can use microsoft documents from ubuntu aswell

oh that 's soon ... .
not in the live iso..

the weird short name

and sorry about fixing invisible stuff ; - )
what happens if you apt install libudev-dev -- reinstall ?
done .
so download and install 14.04.3 : ) it 's the best plan
otp , will be able to later
ah , we have a promulgation command/api call
in /etc/fstab have unnix rules that are manipulated by unix default , together with kernel forbidding any kind of executables
i see you know me well ...
indeed i just like the thought of having a hub 2 2 birds 1 usb device : )
we have dandelion and burdock , but it 's usually too sweet
yeah ... do n't have to tell me that . also the slow-burn of housework means you can sustain it

mir mouse events are being sent from qtmir to the qml mouse pointer , so it decides what to do
what provider are you using ?
did this fix go into lts-u ? it obviously went into lts-v if it went into v .
no , i checked that before ( no u-standard on touch )
what do you want ?
like this ?
does n't mean they do not exist in debian , is just however is customized out of the box ,
great .. then i wish happy trails to you . we have nother adventure next time .
are you asking me a question
ubuntu is much better for you
are you running ubuntu or are you on windows ?
does /var/log/syslog mention anything ?
normally you should not have to add mirrors , should install right out of the box
cool , good to know . for the next time maybe .
yep : )
and those all pass ? so it 's just deployer and quickstart ?
in fact , checking that retries happen with exponential backup seems somewhat unnecessary
we just have to get over the hurdle of associating the instances with checkbox jobs
no , this is kubuntu support . linux mint is not supported here .
do you have any ideas where i can look for logs
anything else i should install ?

my first impression was wrong .

kind of odd , select a language though
how does the browser know when he finishes

i tried looking around in various settings utilities , but i did n't see anything about it . i do
also , # winehq
i ca n't do that with just the normal network permissions ?
and especially since we would probably have multiple , namespaced lib dirs

jamespage : nice fix ! ... it totally makes sense that was the issue ... i ca n't stop smiling
i write and read ansible quite a lot . it looked exactly like one of my scripts !
np
how new is the laptop ? maybe if returning it is still an option , you could just ditch it
so you should just see it in nautilus and be able to click to open , no ?
had some problems last time i tried with ubuntu server .
been short on people able to review my code lately
well that 's good then . but is there still performance problems ? i have n't got an ubuntu device
if you do n't use chroot , it should normally be secure enough anyway unless you do something exceedingly stupid
look that up at home : p
nope - think its bad ?
i had enabled it one time , but adb did n't work , then when i went back into settings
make sure devs are aware that rc-proposed will contain ota6 not the latest proposed
yep , thats the plan
i agree
they are running an ancient kernel , but it seems your case is much easier to reproduce
bekks sorry i am already back ... i just thought about one thing . i use the user `` root
yep : /
move it back to the windows pc , chkdsk it then safely remove it then bring it back
stable does n't even work
yeah
crazy .
force ?
do the new strings come with some new features ?
it started happening after the u-s-s silo landed ... was there anything risky in it ?
perfect !
it 's disabled for everyone for a bit , i can fix that to be more targeted , sec .
yes , they 'll get ibus after installed the system , and installing langpacks make it change to fcitx
i tryed frome chrome extension
yes , that 's the one i believe
which ubuntu version ? which amd card ?
is ubuntu treating you okay ?
why is it not advisable ?
how many environments are there btw ? about 10 ?
can i move the cards from sapphire 's kanban to moonstone 's for those bugs ?
you have superpowers though , you can use the system gopath
no problem
so then , when i choose 'something else ' , i will divide up the unallocated space into / ,
yeah it shows three options , fast boot ( which just says `` fast boot '' when selected , with
what ? ! hmm
mint , kali , pearos , mint are based on ubuntu but are not supported here
you and sil2100 mentioned me earlier . about your branch i guess ?
and there wo n't be a version of 1.24 with containers and `` ignore-machine-addresses '' working
looking at /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/udev
ok. btw , why are you searching the filename as a substring , instead of adding `` .desktop '' and
this is about kubuntu , so kind of off topic .
ouch .. that sounds like a situation tj- is better qyalified to handle . // are you able to effect
in the top there isnt anything similar like that running
guess it depends where you put grub . booted a live session and seen your partitions still happily sat there
heh yeah well would just jump to the troubleshooting since you already started setting things up and this one is
or should i just target it to 15.10
do you really think ms id going to publish their little secret , cnet is quite reliable in my view
not when i am getting bug reports about clock app looking bad when running it on rc-proposed ; ) in
save yourself some time
i have the pi.. the original one.. i run lxde raspian on it.. no problem
hmm . i do n't see any output from grep -r apparmor in the dnsmasq source packages
fresh install kde alongside working unity
yes , it does
yes , why ?
i use byobu or mush for those types of connections
oh ! : )
this conversation might be a massive coc violation .
do you have a question ?
what happens if you change your personal namespace ?
inputmethodcomposing
this is a source code internal to company..pre-compiled and linked already
chrooting there and using apt is safe ?
as if to send notifications to a bigger group of users , like 100 .
the n4 is too big : )
the only package that depends on nullmailer is exim4-config
did you have a chance to do the tests on rc-proposed ?
but can i specify only that program ?
ohh wait , i lied
i 'm talking about the bug itself having 0 activity since the upload .
ctrl+alt+f2
but you do n't know how to drive those relays , the control mechanism , hard power on/off , etc
after a reboot the logs are cycled to log.0 or log.1 . see /var/log/ for syslog etc
to properly support bios+efi , ./diskimage/core_grub.go needs some concept of the target architecture . how should the interface to this
yea i said i had hundreds of packages
just try manual mounting of the filesystem in question .
for now yes ; and in compiling ircd-seven i get another error , different than yours : d
note - if you had gpt/uefi they would all br primary
but then wallyworldwen and benchmarked..
it sort of created a fail for ota5 touch langpack updates
oh , and congrats on getting changes landing in ubuntu ; - )
can you also tell us wich channel you installed ?
on other networks
sil2100 fwiw other normal accounts ( twitter , google , fb ) do n't appear affected
what freaking whatever ?
and create has to be changed slightly to accept at least one subnet
ok. can i test this tomorrow and then top-approve ? its late here now
virtual domain buckets do n't work with ssl since the cert is registered for the domain
it was supposed in the image from ~30min ago
given a faulty system , changing the package source ca n't help : d
well , i 'd be happy to help alpha/beta test if you guys need public tests eventually before throwing it
try sleep < time > & & notify-send -t 0 alert something here
: p
ok , heading there
oh those pre-generated branches are nice
did you try system settings ?
log a bug against it
please take over .
a prime example is at work here for me - the sysadmin prefers centos 6 systems , i prefer debian/ubuntu
oh , that may too be the reason . if it 's so i 'll change the test above too
so if the copy triggered new builds , does that mean the the binaries were n't copied ?
good evening !
well first i would just write the iso there .
sounds like a 'you ' problem . =p
this is a non-issue in practice though , you 're only noticing it because you 're paying too much attention
upstream everything is git , debian is still for now svn , ubuntu is bzr
did you get a cursor ?
yes , we 're moving to a new model for the charms/bundles that removes the pulling from launchpad and allows

also , look into the female connectors on the devices in case there 's something stuck in a socket
unless lsi are complete morons .
pls help . it 's network card not wifi
it is what we do .
i do n't think that 's necessary , the point is made either way
it does n't actually contain anything itself but requires unity , evince , etc ... .
no
how is the experience with battery life ? what applications do you use to manage power ?
we agreed to use debian git
does your windows partition have more space perhaps ?
calligra version is set ( calligra_stable_version_major 3 ) # 3 for 3.x , 4 for 4.x , etc . set
so use the software center and select another mirror in the settings .
yes

ah , good point about using setup in timeit .
this is a nonsensical discussion , you can do the same thing in ubuntu , and redhat also uses udev
sure , i 'll be here : )
we no longer possess that file .
it 's for you to make sarcastic comments on irc and annoy developers
how can i do that using screen ?
well , it 's probably every media player
it 's a windows app to take over the uefi boot loader

we need code in the indicator redirecting to settings and code for settings that handles the redirect . no sharing
any app that makes sound on my little laptop comes out of my big laptop
no bug on my side here , working like a charm
huh ?
it breaks the most prominent games , like neverball , neverputt , cut the rope etc .
that file only has root in it ?
say only 1 displaybuffer needs a redraw . does the android mm stuff require the other one to also be
that sounds reasonable
oops , i take that back
fun . did anyone who thought it was a good idea also think to check if it builds everywhere first
have you done enough with this machine that a clean install would be a hassle ?
go with it
if it 's sata , which sata version does the sata controller on the motherboard support , and what does
how to check plasma version ?
the grave looks pretty modest , certainly in comparison to that nutty palace in the capital

not that i want that . just thinking out loud if it would n't make sense

yup , nothing interesting was discovered there
less interesting in ubuntu proper , as our preferred gui package updater ( update-manager ) already highlights security updates via

let 's take a detour and check this out then . the dkms listed kernel version is from 15.04 but

ack
did you enabled ssh ?
the first link there is the actual rules file
ah , ok
oh good : )
did you push the edge to alpha already ?
ok so that 's sorted . dkms takes care of recompiling kernel modules after a kernel update
if you could comment on the bug , that 'd be super helpful
so you 've got neither /etc/init nor /etc/init.d ? !
excellently
it 's in main and thus gets security updates .

we kinda destroy drives a living around here and have found the micron ones to be the most resilient
hi
willing to play if you 'd like to help : )
the one managing this team ? in a train to london
got it , i 'll tell kilos on freenode
: )
oh , i see . the ubuntu user is already part of sudo , docker this is just moving it
there is backup available , but you did not set it up - your installation there is also ancient using
i was wondering if you will be back porting the pertinent commit to trusty and precise ?
i am not challengig you : )
hm , well sh*t
what virtualization software are you using ?
i know it exists in jes-cli . i do n't have evidence that it exists in master .
hm ... you 've done some package splitting recently ?
looking at the buildlog for breeze 4:5.3.95-0ubuntu3 , it says kwin-style-breeze depends libkdecorations2-5
yeah ... it didnt fix it . but i am so clueless ! ! !
yes
yep
oh right !
ok , type display=:0 aptoncd in the first terminal
l222 , s/exists/exist/
it freezes until i disconnect the phone line and the modem stops trying to communicate
that 's a recipe for disaster .
yeah i know xd i only know which testing it paused . canonical memory checking
the problem looks to be beyond a simple fix which i could give you . i would report a bug
using a basic server installation would be more targetting : )
i will run your latest changes to the content export mp tonight and comment again . mostly it looks good
is is a goddam massive fucking failure and i am certain that more people than just those working on metrics
yeah , it 's customizable , you can put a sidebar or topbar or bottom with whatever stuff you want
yes .
symlinks are permanent .
ok ... first place to look for clues is `` /var/log/syslog '' where network manager is very verbose about what
yes . still possible .
try insmod ntfs-3g
ok
yes .
no , i said the safest way is with additional driver
this is ubuntu channel , not libreoffice . for bugs on office , join their channel .
how many bytes does my script report it skipping for the early initramfs image ?
no reason a 960 would n't work on 14.04 , sounds like you 've messed up your setup somehow .
same as always
to much effort should be done with less effort , this is the american way . besides , what if
a lot of that is cached pages , when memory pressure gets higher these will be dropped
you are , as always , awesome : d
k i 'll pull the other commit too
one other case i saw once was about raid disks
if i put / /boot and /home all on the same drive , should i bother making separate partitions ?
re the bugs - i would suspect that they 'd all come together as one thing - but no coder
for the kapptemplate task you should make a new template for pyqt5 based on the pyqt4app template
i like you have the choice
for now , yes
wait , what ? problem solved ! start windows , install vbox , install ubuntu server and code your heart
what 's the api like ?
anyway , i plan on tagging 1.1.2 today which will include this
the problem you created is even if you lock the root account root can still login via key
lts has 5 years support , others have 9 months
press your super key and type startup int he unity dash search.. you can add and remove startup applicaitons there
yeah i 'm not sold on midonet-repository
ah in the makefile , that should be fixed already
try udisks -- show-info /dev/sda1
*shrug* you can put the module name into /etc/modules to load it on every boot
but let me try the same steps on my arale
yes .
pick the blocker up that is
if dda from sdk would report progress on $ ipc
as its an upgrade it may still be using the upstart alternative
in a vm with vivid ?
i guess on amd64 -virtual flavour is used which is the default .
how do i do this ?
what 's your question ?
though i suppose , logically math would be more useful for writer than calc
so it will just communicate with the nova-api-metadata directly ?
ya lost me , what `` page '' ``
hmm ... i wonder why the ppa would n't eat the : native ^
if i had a say in it ( and i do n't really ) i 'd say it 's not
the most likely candidate is the utils repo
i had to reinstall !
i dual boot my home workstation with windows . and that does n't have the issue with the intel gfx
but not really , i 'll try to avoid any code at all costs ...
thats what ovidiu-florin is talking about on podcast
packard bell model nr : p5ws0 , yeah i went to additional drivers , and used the first , proprietary
ah no , that worked for armhf , i386 , etc .
does n't work
oh ok , i thought you opened it before
tbh i just purged webbrowser-app ; seb128 said it 's going away from the default install anyway , and i
i did n't even try moving the hwdb-update dep to the udev-trigger.service thingy yet , but it ought to help
ill recomend you 14.04
at least the documentation says that it 's meant for exactly this use case
if not i 'll have failing tests on maas-spaces
i 'm in moonstone
dell i5

you are mr. server now : )
nice you asked before pasting .
i never tested the patch , looks like no one did
it can be fixed easily , but the expected behavior needs to be well defined - do we unset what
trucking then eh , covered most of the country ?
right , because you removed the init file : )
i 'll look shortly anyway
yes
i am running varios softwares in windows and linux via usb vfat disk

i did mention hackfest .
no idea ...
it appears that your hard disk is pretty toast
done
right ... there was a fix recently which did mess this up .
m_openscope looks like is set always to mockscope9
when i search for that in the dash , i get an application that i can install .
your task is to setup a xenial pbuild environment : )
do you have anything in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ ?
`apt-mark hold package-name` to prevent upgrades
yes - that 's ehy i was wondering if qtmir wass just a compositing window manager
now i set chmod 755 /home and seems it 's solved : selffacepalm :
i cheated and did a modprobe of the kernel driver and just restarted xorg ... looks ok now , will

will do .
you can hide it , and use an other dock

i already see a button on pages so , i figure some things exist ; not that it 's critical
great . come back with more specific questions and someone will surely help
still close enough , everything uses the higher version for checks :0
sergiusens ?
remember that the filesystem has to be resized afterwards , too . in case your tool does not do this
there are some ufw files in /etc/ufw
hey , try # ubuntu for user issues
so , when an oem snap wants to load kernel modules , with config : ubuntu-core : load-kernel-modules , then
sudo lshw -c netwotk | pastebinit
i 've encountered worse problems over the yrs than these with new releases . the problems with plasma 5 are
but most stuff runs < multi-user.target , at that point you can definitively call the boot a `` success ''
15.04 is a good release : )
works fine , too
yep . agree .
hm , so how else could we do it then ?
i 'm burning to a dvd so yeah lol
# ubuntu-app-devel
no alpacas , just mountains covered in snow
no i want them to use the opened apps like xcalc gedit etc
yowza^2 ! !
as soon as you add a ppa you lose control of your system
and i 'm wrong - apiserver has addsubnets , but no list yet
right
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb count=1 ( again , make sure sdb is correct , at your own risk )
it was a time of many decisions , not all of which have turned out optimal in the long run
pretty much
yes it does show 2 networks.. i am trying to paste an image someplace
mulitcast-dns ( avahi aka bonjour )
yeah , -mousetouch should do
i 've always used closed source driver so far ... so no idea ...
i let him know
yea , he died : p
i really do n't have much knowledge/experience with dual graphics setups . some users end up switching off the intel
that 's just an example for creating a new branch
anyway , will try reverting that to see the difference
that upgrade does n't work
yes , it 's going to be set on creation of the filter only
bigger issue though is sddm booting into a black screen.. got ta drop to text shell , then systemctl restart
yep
what should i do ?
what is the problem you 're having ?
this sudden ? maybe a new mirror switch , as of now we need exact info to help .
lets have a quick guess , show me the output of uname -a
thats the error alsamixer says when the device is missing , surely ?
i suppose , i 've to report results in the launchpad bug webpage
well try to remove lightdm than
cups now sees the printer though ?
obviously there is a problem with this router and maybe even the os
i thought you were more of a serial console guy ; )
sound like an even better change then
yes
no , this one has n't been used in 2 1/2 years and someone was asking last night about using
i am using gnome disks .
i did . just now . pay attention !
yes , hi . do you have a support question ?
it would be better that you have access to a working machine to sort out your flash drives
because they ca n't be deleted then
please let me know when you have time for this . for some reason , we are now getting a
if the nvidia driver detects an old monitor the resolution it gives the monitor is determined by it 's capabilities
that and the following lines tell us the original cause . nm ca n't 'talk ' to its private dnsmasq
if it 's there then just running it on the command line should work cause /usr/bin is in your path
afaics kenvandine is wrong . none of conflicts/breaks/replaces is necessary there .
got it , i 'll tell squirm on freenode
i want the gnome panels like the gnome flashback , but i like some of unity 's features
oh i just did a couple , is it too late for those ? eg gallery-app was just published within
done , but still has problems
not as far as i 'm aware , but i do the opposite in the m-handling because it seemed most
download the bundle and use `` juju-deployer -c bundles.yaml '' - it should see that the services are deployed and
sorry
: what are you compiling ?
theres nothing wrong with systemd
yup ... amd ...
was the top result on google : )
eh ? `` go away '' was meant at the env vars .
ah wait . its not for 14.04
so windows *after* ubuntu , now ubuntu does n't boot ?

i thought all apt calls were retried 3 times . dimitern fixed an issue a few months ago where juju
i agree
no , of course not
`` storage-add '' should just take a name and optional count , and take the rest from constraints
we do n't do hardware recommendations here .
your query being about boot time is utterly ridiculous , i do n't think that method is supported .
i did n't think you could run vagrant on a vm
reinstalling will not fix it .
the loops which i 've been using are there because i saw it in many other packages .
when i compile , make and make install - it places the biaries there
that 's not the `` aplay -l '' output , it is the `` aplay -l '' output
there may be a tell-tale query-string in the get column , assuming you 're logging that
i had fun converting from eclipse to gradle too . i can offer no advice except read lots and try
looks fine
with fbterm it works as well !
i do n't disagree with that though .
maybe both , dunno

then reinstall with real ubuntu and you can enjoy the full ubuntu support
i 'm saying this channel is only for ubuntu technical support
so your media center pc is command line only ?
no because i still use ubuntu on my desktop
at least i 've completely identified it . finally . it 's an xbox 360 .
should i move back to the open source tested driver ?
oh -- is your firstboot thing type=oneshot ? and/or , did it actually *finish* before networking.service ? can you pastebin
ok thx , i 'll try upgrade and rollback from there
it is used in four times .
what 's wrong with formatting your pc and then installing 14.04 ( not 03. ) . wizard is quite simple
got time to make a merge now and i 'll test and approve ?
tal : condition can be any tales expression . but i do n't think it 'd be bad to have
ok , cheers
depends how much you 've got , how fast you can get it . unanswerable
use phusion/baseimage -- it 's built off ubuntu 14.04 , but `` done correctly ''
i deleted the partition . i left only the /dev/sda1 , then used the graphical installer to create a swap

yes latest upgrades
understood .
\o/
yakuake or konsole ?
i 'm looking for the bug that captures that whole conversation
ok
why not ?
or is there some special process which takes ota8 and adds a few cherry picked items ?
unless i just download once and unpack into the stage area and forget about putting it in part.installdir
so we ca n't land
or look into the logs of that time
the problem is : your disk seems to be hardware wise dead .
dragging windows is taking forever
again , from the install , terminal command 'df -h ' to know where the space is used up .
is it asking to install flash ?

everybody is invited .
describe your issue for actual help .
no . at the session lock screen . i 'm trying to unlock my session .
maybe if we detect that the file does n't exist
it almost never is dbus : )
if you are n't dealing with too much u/efi nonsense , you just grub ( 2 ) -install to /dev/sda
`` echo -e ' # ! /bin/sh\nexit 101\n > /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d '' ( try using single quotes )
turn off menus-show-images or whatever the setting is called .
you do know you are currently booted from the live iso ?
well , i 'm used to it , five of my apps are currently blocked because the relevant api calls
wait , what ? i 'm lost -- how would the upcoming pip plugin solve this exact issue
mystery solved
do you know why the existing branch : +subscribe etc . permissions are the way they are ? i was
yep
basically it 's because click is still being pulled in
yes
the problem is not truncate , but the fact to use it you have to open the file
ah
^ great thought .. wonderful way to build a solid data base .
try df -h or install gparted
do you use google calendar ?
same error .
oh god how i miss sparc
it may be worth you contacting the libfprint developers directly and asking about support for your device ; they may

adam said it could be caught by unrelated changes in another package , will really take some digging
how
this one mentions it
yes , will do

so it 's not a regression

then yeah , you can go the single partition route

once you 've got the ppa set up
they all have authentication login
i stopped it to prevent it eating its own cache , and ... failed
yes : )
and i did n't actually touch my computer on saturday , we had so much to do

if you wipe emmc then you still boot from sd but now do n't have the missing uenv.txt
specifying both cpu-power and instance-type is the correct error
how do you do that , in particular ?
you are doing this from a live iso ? you can not change a disk in use .
you 're on ipv6 ?
ah , yesterday i thought `` something looks weird '' on that screen
this command i showed you is just for listing the packages .
prime suspect would be dnsmasq
the initrd name will be in the boot-loader entry
you 're going to have to upgrade to 14.10 first then 15.04 by the way
and in uqmlscene we convert mouse events to touch events before sending them to the qml scene
not that i know of , it 's not installed on 15.04
i never knew that existed . feel free to close it
for the most part you 'll be working from ram , like most installs
does n't seem to be the case with the tf101 ; )
but `` added '' is n't enough , is it ? it shold be `` installed '' or so
did so
did it error ?
no , for a fresh install you would format /

well if grub is only on the hd , you should n't even see it if you are actually booting
use the username you create during installation .
also the apport thing - i did n't actually point you to anything : d
platform-api not affected
yes . dont use su .
so keeping the tests identical too might be easier to maintain
ok then with sda1 unmounted , run : sudo fsck /dev/sda1
gon na try and replace it with the internal ip instead of dns
i ping you when i 'm back : )
if you still experience problems using the correct credentials , it would be awesome if you could create a bug
but someone forgot to write this upgrade step
very good !
that was on 15.04
live session has normal volume blips
did you used my work as a base ?
not at all , and grub is loading fine , but it does n't load the kernel and give me
hum ... ... ..
but that 's a thing which you should be able to just copy from the old jenkins tests ?
and the processor ?
oh wait ! this log does n't actually contain the debugging for adt-run
ill see what i can do
flashplugin-in 11.2.202.554 amd64 adobe flash player plugin install
not really , thats onle the generic stuff from the website
sorry , guess i 've forgotten howw to prevent grub from autobooting into the login page , but you could
hm , we install that on servers , right ?
ah : )
but would be nice to have win7 on grub
we moved away from txt files and fatwrite to using a binary blob environment file and put everything into variables

that really depends on the type of applications you wish to run .

it should n't be , in future
you can install windows software on it also

how can i upgrade to vivid ?
i rebooted
no . if that was the problem the greeter puts up a warning message .

ok shall do
type which marble in a terminal
are you booted into ubuntu right now ?
the version number is n't random , it 's consistent
it looks good . all approved
yes . i manually removed 3.4 and 3.2 to see that fixed the problem , but unfortunately ... that just
it wo n't boot in legacy mode with secure boot disabled ?
type `` sudo nano /etc/fstab ''
np : )
excellent ! : d
maybe not but ca n't help you with unreleased releases
make them all executable , but vmcommon
hows what working out for me ?
i 'll look them up .
a branch for each dep , like utils should have a 1.21 branch/tag
it 's not a good reason not to approve option selector : )
possibly , or provide -- force via a third party tool like the stuff to remove juju now
i can simply switch it off in the bios : p
if you do n't it all works ?
no , it 's an array of strings
usually , the vb complains if there is a newer version but it did n't for a while now
i *think* it 's only important to store non-empty values ( after doing resolution )
sudo apt-get update upgrade dist-upgrade
likely toolchain or dependents differences
because right now , you 're on the path to creating a second desktop
right , so a step in the right direction : )
plus it had a geforce 550 ti in it that i pulled out - using on board video now
thats the worst ideo .
no idea .
moving what files , to where
then dpkg -p them for purge
feel free to not share the remainder of your frequent moment-by-moment updates
first thing : on the starting screen , it 's called `` app '' , and it should n't be
we could drop it after 16.04 , perhaps .
sounds weird to not fail in that case though and looping retrying forking
how do you know that it is about dhcp and dns ? are you sure it is not because of
i would make a new partition table if you want legacy
try # # hardware or # ubuntu-offtopic then
pull and try again : )
doubt it .
okay so that is the first requirement .
i will give it a try . i will connect over lan .
coolio , i wanted to try a couple of things out to get an understanding of the code and how
no vpn involved ?
yes , and ubuntu does n't honour that line they have reject our streams change in 1.20 and our right
will it change my current grub on my primary internal drive ?
oh , is he on hsdpa ?
troll harder
try this : gconftool-2 -t string -s /desktop/gnome/applications/browser/exec `` /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable -- incognito ''
do you have it ?
wait ... ... ... .
which also gives us perfect hud integration
i usually use something like `` adt-run ./ -- - qemu ... '' , typing laziness
right : - )
yeah - i 'm happy we wo n't be the only team not showing interesting stuff : d
are you using fglrx or fglrx-updates ?
ping coreycb or jamespage on # ubuntu-devel , they touched it last
recoverymode/fix broken packages can help sometimes
two config variable that were not used previously are expected to be enabled now
wrong channel
riddell 's gone out , mind doing it ? i do n't think i have permission to do that
i came in here for an answer to a question , not for your personal views on nomenclature . so
telnet is tcp
i can only select sda2 , choose filesystem type and mount point
precisely
sounds ok ?
no , they are emphatically not linked in any way .
sometimes modems do n't like you hairpinning
just do it ?
exactly .
ok , leave it to me
wait i 'm wrong
i would suggest just installing xfce4
what ubuntu are you running exactly ?
ah , perfect
weird though that it was n't a problem with 14.10 , though , would n't have expected such a regression
it appears to be , i 'm double checking
that should only matter for things he was editing at the time of the crash that he did n't save
cmakelists.txt ?
i guess fn + f2 still not working ?
xgene
it did
same here , but still off topic
multi-series services will be necessary and will be awesome
any help needed in writing autopilot tests ?
happy2help !
dont ' reboot . get a terminal open
can i sees the image version in the installed systemd anywhere ?
for the log readers and all .
what does lspci say about onboad ?
ah . removing dns got me back on
hey , the last qtmultimedia upload on krillin vivid image # 193 broke playback of ubuntu touch camera recorded videos
so that mobo has uefi support ?
an entry in /etc/crypttab looks like :
so what yo suggest me to do
it needs postinsts though
not really ; the account-plugin-facebook will contain the other ( working ) services ; and this is correct
yeah , i 've got that one , but you used the plural
btw . you subscribed to the lt mailing-list , right ?
use a pastebin like paste.ubuntu.com
no that is adults/kids/coders not parents
ok what ?
so yeah , citrain ca n't deal with silos like that because installing the silo requires access to the archive
well , even that one does not need it ( it 's an optional dependency )
i 'm on 12.04
thats why dd with smaller total amounts of data than the io cache size is totally useless .
do you have a good guide on setting that up ?
i 've reverted that commit , cursor still gone
i do n't think you understood me . patterns are just code that solve specific problems , and the community
: d
you ! : )
< sigh > i can not do anything in the boot : area
it used to be done the other way around for sure .
i do n't think there should be much to discuss .
so the code that is running is in cloudinit/config/cc_chef.py ; if you add a sleep at around line 114 wherever
ah , you 're using the wrong file .
what should i use for something with a gpt table ?
check 1454 of syslog , alot of compiz warning

were you playing the videos on neoseeker ?
you should install the package icedtea-7-plugin
yep , except for tuesday
yeah , and some computers use punch cards
my preference is to put them in .bash_aliases which is run every time a new shell is created . not
the only gles11 unit i have is that android custom one
i 'd try 'go build -ldflags `` -x main.version $ ( git describe -- tags ) '' -o ... '
awesome !
the result is : error : unknown filesystem . because ( hd1 , msdos1 ) is ntgs
so , stop
sure
it 's certainly safer that way
well i prefer tools in command line , you get better errors warnings , and i feel it less error
i 'm trying to understand bug 1477149
yeah i know that is hard to define , but lets say file changes , new users created , connections
i was testing the silo , so probably its related to that .
i was thinking though , if we see which charms fail on ppc64le we could have a general idea ?
ok , that 's fine ... i can check that as well
ubuntu studio is music/audio production
i said df statically links with gnulib not libc
what device do you have ?
that 's the one ! not the auto-lock , to clarify .
forget about the driver ; that has zero to do with it
they 're not linked together , that 's the point . cpio archives can not represent symbolic links , so
i 'd reccomend simply installing the lts version of ubuntu
can we get it disted then ?
there might not be any bug ; it might be just fine and i 'm just not aware of the

if friday 's images were perfect , we 'd not block off a week to do this . : p

have you reboot the modem router ?
but that 's not what happens on boot , we do n't restart journald

something isnt sitting good with me.. i start te openvpn service , run `` netstat | grep openvpn '' and
i try testdisk deep research and i have a `` ntfs '' `` os '' can it be windows ?
yes i enabled irssi sound notifications and just trying if anyone pings me
yeah but what if the first exec fragment is `` env ''

i could , depending on the language
should be fixed by now already
?
well , i guess the people uploading untested webapps will keep on using the standard template anyways as they are
you 'd find it easier to use the gui
just realized , current image might not be good to use either , it does n't reboot
i 'm sorry for confusing you .
1 is frequently occupied , try f2
i 've been always extreme tester
eventually snappy will become the base of everything
well , you installed a package . so one can asume you not randomly typed letters to install it so
the whole testsetmemberserrorisnotfatal does not make much sense to me
could i replace the textfields that are holding the scores with label 's
right , and you use ubuntu-device-flash for that i guess , is there something in ubuntu-device-flash to do the remixing

i can ... .i was just hopeing to avoid installing all the updates when i can just download the latest
iirc , plasma needs to be loaded for the plasmoid to run , and whilst kwin does that , since
i already installed what k1l said : )

check this link , i have this link for more than a month lolx.. its complete explaination of my issue
you made it sound like the whole computer died
it really means alot to me

you have to get the diff from the distro release and commit it to your trunk .
from what you 've told me , you 've tried to do exactly what i also expected to work -
how are you testing your sound ?

yes , do a 'sudo ls ' from outside the directory
kind of ; it uses mesa 's software renderer

and from now until the game ends , we are enemies .
are you behind a proxy of some type ?

never mind , ignore me
righte 10.04- > 12.04
hmm , beginning to think your media / machine is a bit suspect
'cause we do n't even know what client you 're using
yeah i downloaded a file
simple test , rename .config folder to .config_bak and try to login then
ok , do n't worry about me , i am too sick to really even think atm , bloody food
rather than running the whole of runner as root

now it failed on 3 archs instead of 1 : ( please just do n't press any buttons so i
odd .
that 's what free software is all about
ok , so first prepare the normal silo for vivid
also , ubuntu-core-launcher needs an update for hwaccess
nice
run `` lspci | pastebinit '' then
so it 'd still keep the building blocks you 're looking to add ( we can fancy it up in
success !
hummm ... . 1 ) do you own `` your '' /home ' ls -al /home ; la -al /home
but from what i see you can fix it by having a proper /etc/default/grub

kk good luck
sudo apt-get install -- reinstall unity ubuntu-desktop
ahh - so each of those tasks is limited to 1 student ?
hower this is not possible in vivid
again , you 're not giving us anything to work on . what happened when you used ntpdate ?
the no-install-recommends feature works a treat .
able to help test ?
problem is , i can remove /usr/bin/juju but it keeps on *coming back*
just arrived back home to my `` real '' machine . might get some time to play with sdl tomorrow
'cause it is what i know
i argued with people and gave technical explanations on why the global menu bar is not good ui design ,
so yeah , lock on boot is something we were hoping tsdgeos 's patch would fix ... apparently not ,
where , you are nit even close to giving usable details to help you with .
and try listening to these words `` it is not a good hardware platform to run linux on ''
what does that ^^^^ mean to a layman like me ? : - )
there is a difference , as i just showed
have fun !
also use su < user > -lc
i can tell you that this more a limitation of lxde atm . then it is a general linux problem
well , in your case its easy
i did that , but managed to install .3 instead of .2
delete the ubuntu partitions - install ubuntu on the correct sized partitions
you can get 1.7.1 from maas-maintainers/stable ppa , sudo add-apt-repository ppa : maas-maintainers/stable
i see vivid has 3.19.x by default
would n't it be easier to file a general bug against ubuntu-gnome-desktop^ with all apps to be included ?
ok , if you are done soonish i can test it

makes sense ?
so where can i get instructions on setting up raid 0 ?
what exactly is it you are trying to share ?

how do you get there ?
you can use whatever dm you want .
indeed .
although its similarity may be influenced by however the vendor will chose to restrict the phone it that happens
nothing of this has anything to do with changing passwords . so either you 're mistaken and your keyboard settings
yeah check if nouveau is loaded with lsmod | grep nouveau
ok
and what are the errors ?
i 'll be happy to be proven wrong though , just sayin.. ; )
did you install the 64 amd version of lubuntu ?
if you install fluxbox you willl get a better idea the difference between desktop and wm
sure , so ordering means we may or may not get it before db-relation-broken and db-relation-dying etc .

it should n't have wiped the config
first silo with manual upload and second silo a sync silo ?
i was just testing your branch on my device and i also see the timeouts
and we are n't using dget anymore
yep . if there 's a provider you like who does it , i 'm sure support could be added
what did i tell you about not pasting into here ?
laptop or desktop ?
yes , good luck with that , what os allows a ' & ' in a filename ?
then run sudo do-release-upgrade to upgrade to 14.10 with lts upgrade disabled because 14.10 is not a lts release

that 's not a compression program/protocol .

as you requested
yea using apt-cacher-ng was useless for `` apt-get update ''

right

do you perhaps know what could be the cause that my update notifier does n't work ?
did you work out how to get ssh access ?
why
that 's one option . i want this to be done programmatically . a usb hub might reduce the power

that is built on top of both of those branches

that is too much 2 g should be fine

the problems are the apps , which do n't support to be scaled per screen

it is much like writing mbr of syslinux . it even has the exact 440bytes
the kernel is backported form 15.04 to the 14.04.3 so its already tested .

that does n't cover the boot-loader , the file-system structure , the layout of the iso image

i got some stuff done with dholbach earlier .
in kb , right ?
heh ? ? ? !
it does work when i called it directly .
ahhh , so it is fake-raid rather than software-raid , as in the metadata is set by the controller
i 've had it working in the past , is there any particular issue you 're facing ?
nope . remove will remove the app , leave the .config . purge should remove all trace of the app

yes so your using a command from an older version

ok. just asking if you think it makes sense in general . i 'll comment that we need an sru-bug
yes , i connected through guest mode
so its your choice really if you wan na enable or disable after ubuntu install

if you look at the output of the broken one you 'll see it 's missing the device files /dev/*
it 's probably a very specific bug and no one was able debug or fix it yet

you 're not falling into the common trap of thinking it means to upgrade version , are you ? :
this is all css btw ( except for the foreground icony part )
also , how did you figure out the issue ? ( some what curious haha )
how 's life ?
just reproduced in latest stable , so the fix is n't there
most of them are logging/error messages reporting , however the important bits are in the tests
that 's odd , then . if you use the `` -o loop '' and `` -t ext3 '' flags

your prize is a sense of emptiness and loss .
is there anyway to prove that ?
you hampshire way then ?

but there are other options if you find vnc overwhelming
that 's great , so when you say signal strength indicator , do you refer to the network indicator or
yes u r : )
maybe query and then if events > 10 , then do n't flood channel ?

because supposedly that is your efi partition

not in the slightest.. you are not asking questions

it may need a member of ubuntu-release to go and create an `` ubuntu mate desktop powerpc '' entry on

can you revert that ?
and had to re-build from scratch ...
yes .
it 's not just you , ad is a beast at the best of times

not that i can see .
grow up
ah , going to need a core dev ack .
ah , that 's why you have the problem then
only the 2 first bits ( cordova is not related )
yes , it has minimal impact
we 're in

i 'll just retry again , it seems they all interlock on each other then
still , those values should come from the graphics driver , if they 're bad , not much we can
cool
hey . ms. cleo has retired . how about you give all of the details .
sounds good
something new is being added , and i wanted to comment on it for posterity
i actually renamed the amarok folder to an unrelated one and relaunched amarok ; that did not fix it .

can you log a bug for that ?
not in stable ... . phew
two lines .
hmmm no idea , i see systemd stuff in ps auxw|grep systemd
have n't heard anything
you 're only jealous that my ability to point is so accurate ; )

is the fs failing to mount ?
i added a comment on that fyi
i just want a bare damn linux install hah
tell me more
are you a dev ?
did you `` sudo apt-get update '' after making the change ?
or something similar .
yes , but i rephrased the question ...
one last question . if i copy that xfwm4 to my .themes/iris , is it going to work ? just
hm , still sounds related ( or even identical ) to # 1333215 ?
gtkterm for serial terminal , unless you can suggest something better .
whas it a window file share ?
have to see if belkinsa will swap
when you get into windows open an administrator command prompt and type diskpart
you could just use quotation marks for the directory you are moving
nope
dpm should let that through
but i ca n't see anything interesting in the qt 5.4.1 changelog
it 's hit or miss with firefox , i always use chrome for hangouts these days
is the lvm method cleaner and easier to use ?
any logs to get while reproducing , etc . ?
why ca n't you use the system menu in the upper right corner to shut the machine off ?
indeed . i 'll have an updated one soon
i figured out how to get virt-manager x window over putty onto my windows box at work too !
aha ! didnt know that was there , i take it i want dpkg.status.0 ?
neat : ) we shall see what the nvidia 304 does then
did that with your commands
just so you know - otherwise we do n't get a highlight
likely , you can just change the font , and find one you like
see for yourself , there is no driver for that card in the driver menu .
seems to be a fun game though , enjoy : )
show us the command you are attempting to do .
he 's got 14.04 installed already
is that format that important ?
mvo : current stable is the same as alpha # 3 , so we can start flashing that one .

if that 's funny , there 's a lot of fun to be had : )

ok did you run the command ?
oka
have you landed anything recently in vivid-overlay ?
oh sorry i missed the line where you fixed it above
i dont see a dig or nslookup test in your pastebin
but ,

those were missing previously
chrome has the pepperflash
it is taking quite some time

you 'll need a live iso image on dvd or preferably a usb flash device , boot that , and
tried waiting for a long time , and it does load after the screen has been locked , but that
yeah , but i guess a `` could n't open fd ' error would be better than `` buffer overflow
see ya on the other side !
for what device ?
so downloading them would be a lot more troublesome ?
really ?
noticed it suddenly had a patch and a branch on the milestone list
what are you trying to play it with

go back to windows and undo that 'set the battery to charge up to 60 % ' ?
sounds like a plan
no

what device you testing ?
why not from apt-get ?
i 'll test `` known-good '' video/audio on something i know well that is well supported like vlc ... this
why would i do such a thing ?
hmm . i enable it . and it still freezes .
on older systems ( i.e . dos and what came bfore , and some modern bios ) scrolllock or ctrl+scrolllock
right , so should we move xmir out of ppa ?
ah ok..
you 're a happy person : - )
looking : )
also , this was fixed in 15.10 , not the phone
yes , i need someone that can configure jenkins to build these projects
have you configured you mic
a team admin should probably be able to see it if there 's any teammembership at all .

dunno why , but i only got upto rc5
15 mins , not that bad
your `` else '' condition should instead be this :
no experience with apt-pinning
just add `` machine number assignment no longer sequental '' to the release notes , feature shipped ; )
hmmm , so i do n't think those two domains are connected in my mind : ) also : the

you preface `` sudo '' to the commands that need rooti rights . but dont just run every command with

where exactly is the documentation not working ?
i want it for nas server
so the better would be trying to reproduce with trycard
well , with ecryptfs it would
no , because apps are sandboxed and can not access any information that 's not included with the app .
thats a good question ; i saw that too !
^^
i 'm not certain , but we have a whole team of charmers that work on openstack charms . the
we can get closer with these , but there still may be issues in the display stack/hardware that we do
success ! it now fails later , the same as on desktop with -egl
they are needed to solve the issues described in that bug 's description
do you use ufw to handle iptables ?
i 'm just telling you what 's happening here
yes . its the windows labled button
please sir
press and hold power ... then it will boot
that 's a good idea
since then we just add more apis and fix bugs + we do convergence features
iirc it 'd be in /etc/apache2/ somewhere -- grep -r for loadmodule and see if that helps you find anything
yes .
cause they were saying not to do it with win8
oh , you mean this is something additional that should be done ?
do you know why i get that error message ? when i 've searched differentthreads of people who had this
dave is off now for a while
what does the third combo box mean ?
! '' } '' event not found , sounds like , it exited the `` alias '' block section and
ah ok. our test are running out of space for kubes and we suspect it 's the vendored binaries
^^^
for me , the cards have a black background
when using it , if you want a feature added , just file a bug report .
i was under the impression you had mounted this external device in fstab , for the plex user ?
there are several more bits that need fixing .
yes , i imagine that .
when i say i have added it to the bug , i have not because lp is broke
i see .
sure , what means full control , though ; )
that would silly imho
try # # hardware
that 's a good point , and perhaps a possible feature .
ok , so here we go ... bug 1427175
butit 's not usedon ci yet
the bot is here , dunno who runs it
now why is n't that in the first three pages of google results ? heh
403 ? that 's odd .
do you remember what caused the problem ? ( filter tests )
the train disallows that - it not allow assigning a silo like that ...
okay then i will definitly try it ... im using it for 3d rendering with webgl ... and the amount
if it would get evaluated multiple times , that 's a qt bug , would n't you say ?
anything i can do now ?
can you maybe check later on if the translations of ubuntu-devices-help are set up correctly ?
are you getting that error code , or does it just say `` something went wrong '' ?
was it a near fresh install or lots of data on there ?
namely ?
nop
try neverball from the app store , that one uses sdl and starts quite fast
because switching to git ?
would that be lot of work ?
looks like it does sgclark
`` command not found ''
yes !
exactly , the rest works fine
just a choice
but if the problem is a compilation error ... .
that didnt seem to work ... still getting the error
sudo apt-get install pastebinit
ah - can you tell me where in the docs i should look for how the config is 'built '
if windows is present , you can find it in system information
i missed that : -/ what 's the public rt ?

why not try boot-repair , it can most likely fix your grub problem
checking
yeah , there 's a make autopilot
there is a mir issue causing some of the failures that is being worked as well
check ../.trash-userid on those
best stick with 14.04 , or wait for vmware to sort out their drivers
anyhow , no worries ... tomorrow is fine i guess
so the ~/.config/ubuntu-sdk/ubuntu-sdk-15.04-armhf/qt5-qmake-arm-linux-gnueabihf is actually the qmake the ide is using for the kit
ohh ... we work so haaaard , sweat blood and shit bricks
sadly the situation is complicated further by the fact that the two providers are changing their configurations during normal operation
we 're running hp 's cloud system 8.1
right , and that does n't work for us
yup , now also smoe strange muscle pain
it wants me to use \ slashes it says ?
yeah well you live in a country where you do n't necessarily need a hat to keep warm either so
yes sir .
no dice ... vivid does the same .
do you see that too ?
yeah , will do ; first checking 1.8 and then i 'll file a bug for 1.7
nothing unusual happened
i deleted it now
checked out the irc log for # ubuntu-desktop , and people started to talk at 04:56 . probably the time
and you mixed debian repos with that too ?
ok
i was thinking something like `` team-topic-subtopic '' for the template
sorry , ls -l /mnt/home
for 2 , do n't you have an im team/group you can subscribe ?
try this , snappy remove webdm & snappy install webdm ( sudo )
more likely c # , from what i heard from devels
can you fix my blunder
^^ that was mvo asking , earlier today
quite a lot of the ubuntu tools use python .
/dev/sda is your main hd , also it references to your mbr
it does . but that would never pass . my only explanation is that a merge went wrong and it
where ?
basically it 's not possible to recreate test results
what about reinstall kde5 ?
kubuntu 14.04 is an lts .
but , then , i 'll get a bytearray loaded in memory of my program of the unzipped content tar
with the init service manager .
i can see my wallpaper and widgests ..
i love quassel , despite all its tantrums . generally it works on my desktop when it fails on my
tabs in emacs alllll day . come at me !
so , what 's the difference ?
ca n't we modify the headers to look like ours ?
you only get it with the jes feature flag
what error do you get when you try that ?
they will be orphaned , so removed with apt-get clean
?
i do n't like this many mocks , so i 'll do it in integration .
how 's it goin ' ?
tangerine works but it seems to serve metadata from a different set than the one used by itunes ( i
so the next question - who was that bouncing about on your bed : p
how untrivial is it ?
want a transition tracker for it ?
apt install says already to latest version
what is running when it freezes ?
it 's an arris nvg599
surely a live session with persistence would have achieved close enough ?
we agreed with design that we make it automatic like we have now , so i like to check with
those devices are at /dev but file descriptors created by a process are under /proc/ < pid/fd .. apparently
what is the output of : cat /etc/issue
it sounds like these tests may be special enough to need a story on our side though , have you
deadsoul__ : sdd , not sda ( or you 'll wipe your disk : p )
it should be there
shutdown which process ?
yep and fingers , toes and whatever else you can cross , crossed
does the server see ip 's connected to openterm ?
btw . will the device tarballs we pushed after ota8 in rc-proposed land with ota 8.5 too ?
it does not , i use ecryptfs
yeah ; ) installing stuff for debian on an ubuntu release is a great way to totally hose your install
i did a dist-upgrade as well , maybe this is n't init 's fault . let me check
so either that 's just a new bug , or something else is wrong
the windows key an issue ?
yeah , and all other packages with virtualbox in its name , in the guest .
mmm , ok
why remove tumbler ? ?
i will add a style for the background , and move the implicitheight to the style as well
what 's conflicting ?
try # apt-get upgrade # apt-get install python-pip
try the universal usb installer
that happens because the kernel , and the scripts in the initial ramdisk image , can not find the root
where does pi exist ?
the readme has three methods to run it .
how about doing the moving in ondocloaded ?
i 've been in similar situations , but the backend applications always ran as separate nonprivileged users .
by who ?
looking at the /var/lib/lxc/android/rootfs/init.rc on my phone i see a couple of lines regarding adbd , e.g there is
but yeah either way installing a .deb file should work it 's just a matter of if the persistence is
tring to be nasty ?
one last thing we can check if they cause their own repo to be added to apt 's repository list
also are you running this server on your local network going through an isp ?
explain please ?
the mediascanner2 landing needs an archive admin btw .
correct
cheers - do you have any starting points on a script for that ? no worries if theres personal info
aka # opensuse-factory
well , looking at your branch it returns listsubnetsresults and an error
can you try the ip right now ?
cursor ( mouse ) is now so totally crapped on this desktop , that selection of any text is impossible
okay , accepted
i was just looking -- libo fails on
i dont have answer to your question jamespage would have an answer
it is , just using foo for illustrative purpose
the lease persistor is just doing as its told and not synchronising anything afaics
3.11.0-12
the question is whether nm finds there is a wifi network available or not .
i would expect someone ( could be anyone ) to clean that up in a separate step

are you logged in with the right google account ? i 've made that mistake before and it 's put
no problem , id feels more comfortable having you on standby in case there are problems
you ca n't , it wo n't work . if you want/need yum , install redhat or a derivative .

oh wait , 3.9.4 fixed it for the ubuntu-touch-session setup commands
no dont use that
hoped for a simpler answer : d
3.2 opengl
ah ok
wich release did you have before 14.04 ?
put all the output then into a pastebin
no ?
but the fact that its so nicely done with sanppy config is because your package is nicely done
same , doing a reboot
there are several branches in there , can you point me to the right one ? the default `` mojo-ue-devportal
what should i type exactly ? ? ?
ship it
depending on what media you install from , but yes .
what are you actually trying to do ?
i did it after the reboot
sense it might make ... but it would not be enough to pass the qa validation
yes , i am thinking of that after i put all of my plans in practice in regards to lubuntu
seems slangasek didnt set one up
i do n't think that 's necessary
which is n't a property
explain what you mean exactly ?
it wo n't be useful for daily builds though as we would have to constantly sync 'master ' with 'debian
sure
lets try this , we 're going to create a lxc container manually
i 'm not a dev , this is a channel of volunteers .
we 'll see .
ppa repo 's are for ubuntu
one has to be carefull here with raid , raid 's partitioning table is not the same same as that
yes , that 's the significant issue , nothing else in lightdm.log
so you have to install java .
atheron qualcomm device
i suspect so , as i have internet .
they found a couple of backdoors in their router code
what am i doing wrong ?
try sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt
but on ec2 , for instance , it would make that port open over the public network vs just the
i did this three times it never shows up in the boot
if you notice other issues it is possible you 've caused unfixable corruption that requires a system reinstall , or
so , is this a requirement of the mir or of heat ?
see your error list : line 32 , 36 , 40 , 47 , 51 tell you how to repair
it 's because the ap tests failed . however , it 's a bit weird , because it 's linking
checking it out . can i compile and run it in place , or does it force me to install
arguing is not my intention , just trying to understand it
ah , so it lost the name for some reason and you ca n't dbus-activate it anymore ( because tedg

merging a an unproven change into every branch was risky
it probably is , but just to be certain . reboot and hold down shift to make sure your grub

rvr found the card for this landing and your comment
a migration got changed in the daily builds
sounds like it just booted the test image
what exact error message are you getting ?
catching the docker hype
my sympathies about windows
okay , for future reference do you know what update-excuses is connecting to ?
nah parted just shows the disk info , nothing to do with mounts . try `` mount | pastebinit ''
( rust/go/ $ shiny )
it 's been ages , but if s-c is going to be kept ( there are perennial rumors to the
lower and raise is the same also..
yes sir . mad
i dont consider it a bug
still there ?
some keys do n't work , and when i try to use konsole , everything i type becomes a ``
apparently that 's deprecated
looks `` right '' , let 's see if that solves the problem : )
maybe , it 's a bug
what ?
ok
i only see another file in /run/initramfs , fsck-writable . how do i get that resize log ?
if it does then its probably a dodgy package installed from somewhere - you can look in /var/log/dpkg.log to see
it 's about time : )
you are probably using amd or nvidia cards .
neat . now try booting your system normally , see if fsck fixed it up
and after that ... reboot
i 've already read it : )
screen -list , screen -d -r #
this is a personal namespace bundle , we have n't promulagated it
you can use something like self.get_root_instance ( ) .select_single ( type , objname ) from one of the lower helpers
that 's icon only task manager ?
yeah , one like in debian lxde i like that one : )
indeed not ; it 's pretty much down to maas and juju now ( for ! touch )
this is vivid
good observation ... just pull the branch and re-run : )
let me dig up a code ref for you
hmm , though i 'm a bit confused , i thought it worked in 15.04 ...
you done any forward porting of bugs from 1.21/1.22 ?
so you only want windows . ask # # windows how to repair your bot
is there any chance to have breeze themes for gtk2/3 in plasma 5.4 ?
the other option is to work on the debian git , but we have a delta , so this mostly
hmm ... . so before , we did n't import encoding directly in our code at all , only indirectly
how do you test
it looks like not every official image is there
it was a lot of maintenance , and there was relatively little actual interest upstream
so to accommodate both oses and the need for large files , ntfs is the omly solution
yes , just a minute
u want the output for pastebinit
gah , not that again
pls reply to pm
have you tried any other qt5 apps ?
heyhey
i 'm currently checking , many depending places
anyway , your debdiff needs to be fixed . i 'll comment that on lp .
i know . i 'm leaving this for him to see later . he spent 5 hours fixing my computer
oh wait , you do n't have a separate home partition right ?
currently the drive is ntfs and contains that file structure , but ca n't seem to boot to it ...
i do n't get your question . how to create a project from the template ?
np
lol . alright then . happy2help !
why ? : )
i 'm not saying we ca n't filter the results we get
good luck
yeah we can do that too . rebasing is nice if we have to come back to anything later ,

i could actually mark the studio stuff for release , in the -release team to get access on trackers to

having any luck ?
if it was horribly broken , you 'd think we 'd have noticed .

no no it ignores lp translations commits . this issue is specifically because *timo* made a trunk commit

no , apt-cache searches actual package info , apt-file searches the files in those packages , afaik
do you happen to know if that 's the same for ppa 's ?
the fundamental problem with nvidia-settings it isnt debsrc-3.0 and only supported *.tar.gz tarballs therefore the original tar.bz2 gets repacked
just let the channel know what the issue is , that 's the way it works here . ; )
this might nt be related to applications : shutdown and reboot works fine for me on my laptop here but
the mount -- bind command inserts the / in the right places
i 'm targeting centos right now . it 's like i 'm wearing bell-bottoms
cause i`m working with caffe and cudnn libraries
gon na see if i can find a solution.\
cool , let 's try !
this is not related to kubuntu but plasma : ) you should ask on # plasma if there are any
i 'm woring on a solution for automatic testing machines that do n't do netbooting
no , i am attempt a standard user
let me take a look now
sounds like you 'll end up with a similar split as kolla has
make a directory
it 's normal for an irc server to wait for you to send user and nick . irc clients do
try running it with gomaxprocs=4
feeling quite okay too , although a bit tired ; started early today as we go to dresden over the

you have to upgrade to 15.04
in order to test webdm , i used ubuntu-device-flash to create a rolling image
just wondering if you know how to quote an arbitrary argument passed to cmd.exe ; we 're trying to write
yes , but you can pull the panel n
do you know of any other programs that use out of process windowing like input methods ?
sudo apt-get remove -- purge is equal to sudo apt-get purge
when i tried using the intel graphical installer
well it is
sorry i do n't have any interest in your query
$ snap_app_path/bin/whatever
i have tested with your link ... .
ok , so there may be some problems due to packages not having upgraded correctly
?
what are you trying to do ?
yes , now check your ngraphics
are we landing those with the train ?
they look at github specifically which sucks .
ubuntu updates kernel too . but in mint u can easily update to newer one if u want .
how can it lose the name ?
no idea , you use lvm . i have no experience with that
make sure you chkdisk with windblows first before shrinking . why are you asking about windows here anyways ?
but it 's done by getting the basename of argv
you said `` in xorg.conf : yes ''
great work on the tutorial
nice
unless there is some new fango technology that allows audio of usb power , yes , it 's bluetooth audio
no worries .
oh , and qtvideo-node to the new 5.5 's qsgvideonode to fix video playback
and that he would n't veto it , so was generally not negative about us wanting something else
considering you do n't have other problems booting
hm ? oh , tarball , i 'm in a meeting right now , what exactly you need , a
that 's even after booting with that added huh ?
that is the root account
ahah , yeah : )
seveas : you just tought me that i can tag two nicknames on irc at the same time . :
nothing crashed
? i alt-tab , then super-tab
run `` sudo ifconfig eth0 169.254.1.1 netmask 255.255.0.0 ''
think you should comment the kernels not to use in /boot/grub/grub.cfg
stick around somebody might know
nice !
sure .
ok so i have booted with dd/unetbootin/sdc and mkusb ( which is more or less a front end for dd
probably the comment in the makefile is incorrect , and it shows the app id constructed the wrong way round
trollolololol
i do n't see that error in that log
i would n't cron , i 'd update the list whenever you talk to the store , snappy update ,
debian experimental has all of 5.4.1 already
that 's what silo 001 tries to fix
drop /etc/apt/preferences.d/extra-ppas.pref , apt update and dist-upgrade again
i believe pornograghic pictures are permitted under the t & cs
i thought this would go in the official terminal app according to what was said during some hangout
try it again , also make sure it 's using the proper partition table type
here 's an example to increase your volume : qdbus org.kde.kmix /kmix/kmixwindow/actions/increase_volume trigger
i only have experience with zfs on solaris , not on linux .
did you really have to merge unity8/livecaption into unity8/externalmonitor ? i wanted to have a branch depending on the latter
ah nice
well , this mp uses threading , which i suppose would not be useful when dealing with oop providers
`rm -rf .git` errors with the message :

so far we dont have built in wifi config feature ; however we have wpasupplicant ;

that seems the only document we can refer to . we need a complete tutorial on snapcraft . will anyone
mint/ubuntu . : )
hmm ... already ?
if not : is it marked as executable ( chmod +x ) and is n't the partition mounted with noexec
wich is default os on your tablet ?
how ?
pings ?
yes ; we need 7.105 now , i 'm bumping shell plugin and unity-api , pls bump in unity8
oh , okay
why do you want a source package ? what 's wrong with the mp ?
check if this week 's was zipped correctly , if it was delete last weeks
quick update : the snappy scope is is the new queue for wily awaiting review
what i 'd say is take a little time getting used to the ubuntu touch architecture . it is deigned
i see no reason not to go ahead with it

you used the ifconfig command ?
none ...

what does multilib mean ?
sure , i 'll recommend that , but typing webdm is faster than hello-dbus-fwk : -p
i 'm not expecting ubuntu touch to be my daily driver/main phone quite yet , so i plan to use
yeah , those are just unity8 crashes really ; maliit will die because it can no longer talk to unity8
mekch msade9 ? google it for info : /
okay , i was just wondering . i 've seen 2 bugs of people doing things we would n't expect
the permission denied was on the socket itself
if they did n't work from the beggining do n't think my suggestion helps
np at all ... w/e you have time ( can use 1:1 )
lets freeze a day earlier ; )
why dont you just run the export ?
how can we help you ?
nice !
based on everything that happened ( and broke ) , i 'm guessing we could remove all those changes we
update the grub
to be clear , those 4 dpkg -i must be run in the listed sequence
i was thinking of doing it for coreconfig
yes
csm ? no clue
open a new tab and do ps -x | grep dpkg see if that command shows anything useful
i 'd be researching online then if i were you .
stop and restart the gui
you know us guys . we not trust anybody anywhere
what exact version is it running
2015-01-19 20:33:12 upgrade linux-firmware : all 1.127.10 1.127.11

not systemd
i did that . i have to mention that i used boot fixer or grub fixer , so i could
it 's a bit grim ; c file spawning off a dmesg|grep to grep for pci ids
what wifi chip ?
line 1444 shows swap is mounted already
does it boot successfully into a login screen ?
and hows the weather : p ?
dd the whole drive
in general , last focused and last cpu are roughly the same .
can you show us what you mean ?
btw you might think about starting to convert to using adt-run for click tests rather than phablet-click-test
it really sounds like you are mixing up the 2 services however
yes . like i said , it was able to bootstrap the controller environment , so obviously those exist and
done
*blink*
burn iso
cool
yeah , there is a lot of stuff in that ppa though ...
sorry ? trusty ?
current stable charm is ok
ok i already got it
np !
that doesnt answer my question .
ahh i 'm using a laptop so i just bought a mouse
i do sleep 4-5 hours every day : ) i have 2-4-6 yo kids.. so sleeping is not exactly something
and still integrated with outer dbus
ok cool i 'll make a mini app and report a bug : )
be carefull with vnc for security reasons , use vnc over ssh instead
so i guess i 'll use `` apt-get install -o apt : : status-fd=3 ... 3 > & 2 2
yes , except it does n't seem to help at all . may be it 's not fonts themselves ,
i can not advise , however , how it relates to sleep .
if using firefox , try creating a new profile . or install chrome to troubleshoot
there 's a w3c proposal for push notifications : )
follow @ eskom_sa on twitter
we can only assume all that media is good , problem here is over the net only so much can
it 's not new - was there last cycle
it resumed without screen-locker
somebody needs to do code debugging with the hardware
\o/
i 'm wrong ; it is working !
well , you never know
even though juju wo n't call watchallenvs itself we should probably have it implemented ( watchall is )
okay ; )
quassel happened
then secure it via password ?
but i 've not seen anything about bios or uefi
my explanation .
i 'll check again in a bit , most stuff shold be right now
and you get to be the guinea pig for the first production run of some new train code ( but
here it is : paste.ubuntu.com/9694734
yeah , i like it too
they appear to be identical
did you forward changes upstream ?
then ?
is there a separate log file for the sshd ?
see , now you 've got me trying to figure out what politeness *is* . i guess i 'd be
but from the logs that'a all left very unclear : /
no pastebin the whole thing with pastebinit as above
type ls -a /olduser and check if it 's empty
yes , d and i were talking about the term `` card catalog '' the other day and wondering how
i had ubuntu on the pendrive earlier , and in the pop up i said yes to replace all files
is that you hammering desktop-next i386 rebuilds ?
there 's no ubuntu bug on it , yet , but i know for a fact trusty , utopic ,
was considering building all my clicks for i386 , but have only done it in a chroot for armhf thus
v
it is not check it 's web page .
'apt-cache show < packagename > ' , you can append '|grep < blahblah > ' to narrow down the output
yeah , i might have a look at helping there
the driver is installed . i have a connection to my wireless . i can not , however , access
ok , missed that . will try again in a minute
i 'll apply your suggestion to the config testbed one , i like the boolean value option
let me give it a shot !
the trouble is they did n't ask questions on what the problem was . they assumed you were running debian
basically it fails to start the user session but as the screen does n't flicker at that point its not
sure
did you install python from source code ?
should be root right ?
actually , i do n't think i 've _ever_ seen that from a cd boot , but then , i
sure test as you wish : p
sudo apt-get reinstall x11-common
oh okey i didnt know
type ls -ld
so on host destruction we 'll still have to manually release the addresses ( destroy the containers )
its extremely useful for me , i use that functionality all the time
yes .
so you installed `` linux-generic-lts-vivid '' right ? to get the 3.19 kernel from thr enablement stack
but tbh , seeing how close rtm is on rebasing on vivid from what i heard , i doubt they
in there you should see a drop down that says it only looks for lts upgrades right now
you 'd probably be writing custom code to use the features of a beowulf cluster ; is your team writing
please ask the actual questions , not ask if people use things ; )
fingers crossed that now we 'll be able to just publish
my initial plan is to install a04 first , then install debian jessie , the 4.0 kernel from sid ,
yep , quick f6 press or edit of the boot menu entry and it would 've been golden .
and example , with lightdm i could n't turn off listing available accounts on the greeter from any gui ,
i can haz wifi \o/
studio_ and yes , installing libav for gstreamer will help you play almost any type of audio file you can
instead of right nvidia-352
currently , yes . with todos to use the algorithm you suggested
currently it 's 15.04. i was on 14.04 and had the ppa mc3man/trusty-media/ubuntu installed . i should have purged it
that was a joke : )
depends on what one has imbibed ...
added !
it 's using ifupdown atm
yeah
done the tag cleaning
this is for a version of gimp patched to work with the new gegl
so after the 1-2 minutes wait you can access it with ssh and start with the walkthrough
better ?
use a colon , not a semicolon
is it still a symbolic link ? /etc/resolv.conf - > ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf
ca n't comment specifically on the gt635m , but if the ubuntu automatically installed nvidia drivers arne't new enough ,
see : man xkeyboard-config .
it 's a simple creature with many features which you can enable / disable
yeah , you can see a better view of the disks with the name and size with sudo parted -l
sure . there just needs to be a line drawn somewhere , otherwise we end up in a mess that
yep , flag definitely does not work
i would at least let jorge know what happened , perhaps its some editor setting he should be aware of
that one there : d
2. there is no 2 , you 're still on 1
will keep my open
good question ...
iirc juju-db does n't have javascript on some arches
wherever you want as long as it 's not in here : )
what means `` scrubs ''
yes , i understand the circumstances which trigger it .
which ubuntu release ?
if our policy is use juju debug-log to see the logs , then wont fix is a valid close
great , i just try to find the mail . : )
with or without a dh_make override ?
i 've also had mixed success with bootstrapping on precise and then adding a trusty machine ; it seems the
10mins is pretty excessive , did you try the pkill command ?
so your up and running ?
yep
i did : i tried to install 15.04 over existing softraid partitions made by 14.04 but the installer failed to
okay , i 'll look at it shortly
and you watch youtube clips smooth and crispy ?
hold on
although the amd64 ones ( adt-nova ) seem to have some networking problems due to proxy config , this is
so should i remove it ?
cd ... not dvd
not , systemdification of various package with upstart-only jobs
d are you running nighlys ?
right
yes
the people in # ubuntu-app-devel might have better info on the sdk side of things , though : )
yeah web is the worst
likely your download was corrupt or your drive was n't sucessfully made up .
and how would i even test it ... i dont have one : p
or you can specify the perfect binary in the first line of the script
you mean i 'm doing your job for you now ? : -p
any problems for me to test using a mock entity
both have the new ip
of course : )
looking into that ...
what 's the permission issue exactly ?
i can image : )
bug 1427566
oh , cool , so all of that would be visible in the remote itself
i asked since my bq that i got today , received its last update in jan 2015 before it was
heck no lol , im on win7..
: (
its something mount related , hrm , and jj did check that the old kernel will not implode with the
i am not doing anything here .
have you tried the hidpi setting in gnome tweak tool ? reset everything and try with the hidpi option and
now ?
hey ! not really an expert , i only used cmake vaguely so someone probably mixed something up , so
i 'm joining because we are using node.js and v8 for the new scope bindings .
ok , is there a way to not strip debug symbols as i see the kernel is compiled using debug
it used to say `` vvvv not found in ppa '' but i changed the message to not include the
wb
well , usually i 'd expect the breakage to be in the devel series , not in the stable series
heh , feel free to change it all ; - )
and where do the logs go ?
no performance issues
hm ?
not the last uitk one , though ?
hummm .. things have changed ? that is the way oem did install/remove is from that script ... lem me
indeed . and tends to happen often enough anyway , since i added that trigger . : p
so , it 's impossible that says 'command not found '
how does grub.efi know which file to use
feel free to ask him if networking needs to be implemented for the gce provider ( basically none of the
what command r u running to mount it ?
1.8. third time lucky ? ? now
i can remove that
but even debian packagers make mistakes .
so it seems like isolated bug .
right , no , i would n't presume so .
i mean , suppose that the client wants an update every second , and the gps gives us an update
i ca n't recall doing it though..
no problem !
sounds good : )
you do n't get an update notification ?
and when tests fail the log are not useful to do any diagnostics , eg . ubunut-system-settings-online-account ... killed without
ah ok . i ca n't remember if this will still be tested by a ci job or not ...
0.5 mbps down/~0.25 mbps up .
it 's libzmq3 compatibility version 4.0.4 whatever that means
you say un-updated systems arent safe , and im wondering because of those security flaws
launchpad connection is very slow , maybe is that
great is a stretch more stable certainly : )
sits out both eths , just sans anything useful
looks like 45 landing as well , hope we do n't have to rebuild 55 as 45 has address book
policy no , but it certainly has an impact on the risk . even more so if there actually are
mostly because debian does not like the latter and may remove it at some point
timmay ?
yes , i 'd like to add some info in the manifest for one of my app just because i
tags were totally untested in this set-env-check-inherited-repeat
i agreed = )
ca n't you set static ip addresses on the computers themselves ?
yeah , i needed those for the dpkg ( from python-apt ) subprocess
if you want sublime2 , use ppa : webupd8team/sublime-text-2 as the ppa address
but cool good to konw
no problem
yeah there is none .
that makes sense , calculator app is what it currently making it bomb on devel-proposed images . i 'll work
ok , i 'm not that crazy then
well , qa ca n't publish either . it has to be a core dev .
ideally , we 'd make systemd bionic aware and memory map android properities and expose them as native conditions ...
unless you have a separate /boot partition , that can tend to be smaller than swap partitions nowadays due to
# ubuntu is for support , and not for whatever you were trying to do there .
yeah , the script is still there , but it 's really tailored to uds 's schedule
`` cat /tmp/lib-list.txt | while read pkg ; do sudo apt-get -- reinstall install $ { lib } ; done
thats what i asked what setup that is exactly
let 's ask fwereade , given tech-lead hat : )
i tried that
yes , atleast for the first impression
which resources state that ?
why are we reverting ?
users on *your* machine , friend
it was n't a server when i installed ; )
i mean , does dns work when its using local cache via dnsmasq ?
fwiw all touch events will go through the shell , regardless of whether they 're sent to the app or
so what
if you 've made changes it will overwritten by maintainers
so they do n't have to set them up in ec2 as a pre-requisite
oslotest maybe
toolchain can be installed ?
i do see a separate tab below `` wired '' that says `` network proxy , '' method is set
what version of ubuntu are you using ?
so , this might just be a cosmetical thing -- systemctl status anything.service will say `` not found ''
do you have a folder called gmail ?
you can pet the cat while you scour through the logs .
i would have hoped something more like `` juju set image=kirkland/mprime ''
unlikely , i 'm using this charm in a production environment
i do n't intend to remove anything
i 'm not asking how is it done ... i 'm asking if is an intelligent way to use ubuntu
maybe i should do it and scam him back ?
yes
nihao !
or wget ?
right that 's why i made him aware first
i m installing it by the way
let me find the driver tool
good instincts : )
is one of you guys going to give a talk ?
this is an egg : )
yes
so ... everything works , in terms of standard deployment migrations . but there is an issue while connecting to
were talking about kde/plasma desktop here , not unity
ctl+alt+f1-f6 is the virtual terminal/tty , can you update and upgrade from there ?
can i install ubuntu from my windows machine to an external drive , and then boot into that ubuntu on
so you can see how many you have completed
i 'll mark it as more work needed , though .
i was more or less suggesting you pastebin /etc/network/interfaces , so we could look at it , perhaps with some
calling autopilot run from checkbox-touch
say you find bug x and report it on the tracker and fail the test
free -m
lol
i should setup something running ubuntu as armhf is ( especially in our team now ) almost front and center
dont use it .
install a version from topic mate
ok , you got silo 12
then the normal install should work
kubuntu is no calories though !
can i ask what are the main issues with media wiki ?
understood , will fix , test and ping you guys in a bit
whats your actual end goal ?
are you cross-building by any chance ?
that depends on what is being upgraded . i would think it varies on what packages you have installed ,
sure
yes
downgrade isnt reccomended , its usefull to use package version for your ubuntu version
i was thinking more along the lines of 10 year olds or so
kquitapp plasmashell ; kstart plasmashell
yeah , so it seems the case if we can get gnome sw center in shape for us

yep , good shout .

that 's localhost , and that means local to the system only .
can you remember for wich programs you added ppa 's ?
that 's fine .
it 's fine - what 's the actual problem you have
agreed .
time
building the -touch packages discarded the non-touch ones as well , argh
do the tests use hacluster and ceph ?
sure , i agree having it in /etc/env is n't ideal either
ok
no , just all the codecs that this phone currently supports on ota-3.5 . it 's just a reference ,
i have . read what i said .
it 's qt based and not qml based
what hardware you using ?

i still ca n't look at each bug individually all the time . so when others like you and cavalier
only do n't know how to log in *lol*
i checked it but i could n't find it
that sounds like you used a 15.04 or 15.10 package , right ?
i mean make ubiquity not generate it

yup , already emailing them both about the request

i also asked in # firefox
what programs , where are they in the filesystem
@ gdrive - ack . i like the sound of it , so i might have a play
which used to point to the licence file in juju-core before testing was split to it 's own repo
me too , that 's why i built both .3 & .4 in my ppa prior to going for sponsor
dude , noone said that , it 's just not righ tnow
usually when one bit fails it all fails . the only exception is the sunrise/sunset which can fail independently
nvidia proprietary driver .
`` docker is a docking application ( windowmaker dock app ) which acts as a system tray
^ could you focus on that and cve triage today ?
try `` ls /media/windows '' again
what is the goal ?
i agree
you can do things like find exactly which kernel version broke it
ok , let 's check the newly installed packages first and then consider comparing the package sizes of themselves
mehh , typo ...
where i can get exact version `` apache 2.2.22-1ubuntu1.7 '' .
however this `` 01:23:45:67:89 : ab '' i am unsure on as what is ab indicating ?
it 's better than before , only a few pixels , rather than tens of pixels like last time around
did you do a wubi install ?
go fetch crystaldiskinfo then .
so you dont have that issue every time you update the kernel
go to the mint support channel for that
they ask questions , and occasionally get help
yup , it 's only python3-evdev at that point ( you may have missed my previous question , let me
ctrl+shift+o will show the bookmark manager , at least for me
are you using the nvidia driver ? cat /proc/drivers/nvidia/version
right , perhaps he did n't actually get past the point of complaining to me that shedir was still the
same to you buddy , have a wonderful xmas
but im using the live cd to talk to you now and it loaded just fine
yeah , they were n't helpful at all
then this is also expected behavior
did you install gnome from the testing ppa ?
but i can only delete up to 39 right ?
i am assuming listprocess is filling that role ?
hint : if you have to use & nbsp ; to get proper spacing , you 're doing it wrong
type sudo parted -l | nc termbin.com 9999
it does n't require a separate collection , but fwereade i know prefers this approach
specifically the amount of free cpu cycles in relation to the total available , the % free cpu or %
in chrome it doesnt even give a warning just a broken website
alas no , just nim has hers
did you see my post about kdeconnect versions for the pc ?
looking .
oh ok , as long as it 's not seeded in the phone ( yet ) i guess that 's
because you dont know of its amd 's fault
thinking about everybody else subscribed to settings
should socket_url be indicitave the ip of my bootstrap nodes ip address ?
1.9.3 is in the overlay so i assume thats where this should go
i thought he moved it to passed
perhaps it can optionally take cidrs and verify if they match , or if not - create it..
otherwise , i dont personally use gnome-keyring , so , i cant give you any first hand advice.. i konw
like above i typed ! manual | botch that told ubottu to print out the manual page info for you
doing so kills wifi hotspot and we 're going to need the fix in indicator-network anyways ...
they 're one-way encrypted and stored in /etc/shadow
thumper : i can only find one recent failure
ahh , i see the problem , i forgot to mark my test file as go1.3
do n't exit here
yeah , tools ppa and wily archive
yes sir
# 381 or the tower bridge one
you get ?
where does rawvalues come from ?
but that options works on filenames , not file sizes .
that could help as wel
however , i 'd like you to scan our juju/* repos for places samecontents is used and see if making
i 'm sorry ...
grub does n't find a kernel nor initramfs .
did grub ever work before ?
can you also confirm which juju and maas versions you are using
i 'm an idiot - was using wrong branch name
yep , i was on yesterday : p
must i remove nvidia 434 first ?
who has been busy ?
i always forget to set it up when i do a manual install
how do you read the config you 're trying to convert ?
the workers apparently can be brought back online , but i ca n't edit the job to actually run the
usually flash , possibly embedded java

+1 , sure
you can specify which uid/gid the external uid/gid should be maped to .
in the archives ? i do n't recall it
maybe ( and this is just a thought ) its that there 's something between linux and windows ? i
and then be in a tgv without net : )
i only found out because michael hall posted on g+
when you start learning something . try to get used to the environment before you start programming it
oh , you can kill the createion of .snappy-systemd in handleservices entirely
sure so you can see it
you can only see a resolution offered by youtube , it is on their end , are you sure gthere
that is what the browser itself sends out ...
that drive has serious hardware problems . it 's either dying or if you 're lucky it just has a

i was able to upload it with com.ubuntu.developer.dholbach.randomcats now
we did n't have any unity side , but that caused a race , so then hacked on the unity
if the window system is not up and runnning , i ca n't ssh into it
ok , then i 'll do the upload
he has been complaining about that for weeks .
guess it depends on whether you think using ashley madison is scandalous
the only problem i can see is that the tests in state/upgrades_test.go are n't checking the error return from the
i had gcc5 installed . so i installed gcc4.8 as /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 . set cc to as that and just make

init scripts are run by root , thus not needing the password for user joe
where can i get help
come into work and a printer is n't working that 's a high volume printer , other than that ok
i will ask alexis about dropping support for i386 ; in the meantime , i will skip the pinger tests
yep
well , if lua-filesystem is broken , that affects lxc , if the b-d of lua-filesystem are broken for something
i 'm not familiar with the circumstances that arose for you to end up running that
owh , nice hhe
this method only works with grub right
what ubuntu version ?
like mtp ?
... ntfs
weird , it works fine with wily with the same error
tsk tsk root not sudo ?
i have formatted my drive many times and never had an issue ! only random power failure causes hdd problems
no problem : )
'job failed to start ' after service squid3 restart
i do n't usually bother doing that much
how about an install over your existing system
look online for guides . there is a mainline kernel ppa
what ?
hmm , do you all have a good pattern for git bisecting things now that juju is in git and
aha ! . ok , then all you need do is a reboot and do n't add 'nomodeset ' .
sudo apt-get purge -- remove unity8-desktop-session-mir
man you type fast
i know nothing of bluetooth ; )
its running a 250gb 4500rpm hdd
any reason we ca n't move juju to v3 ?
yeah , under systemd , mention `` vmhgfs '' ( vmware ) fs type ( and paste your fstab )
i found a markdown extension to allow github-style markdown - the snappy folks will be happy now : )

should i have to disable the bitlocker recovery on windows 10 in order to continue ? im at a loss
does your test still fail when you use the published version ?
yes i followed some guide that said to reinstall some nvidia drivers so i did that but it was for
it should be fairly simple , maybe 10 lines of code
\o/ np : ) enjoy
currently you 're doing `` ls ( hd0 , msdos1 ) /boot/ '' and seeing an emtpy directory . what
ok , please put the output of `` lspci '' and `` lsusb '' in terminal into a pastebin and
you do n't have to as we 're moving to git , do you understand git ?
the order upsets diff ?
clever tests though - never using more than 1 element in the maps during tests
open gedit or what you have write some and print it
yeah , it 's easier to distinguish in the index file anyway .
there was n't an e-mail . it was just peter and i on this irc channel about a week ago
mv_conffile can only move individual files though ?
did you get it ticked ?
alright . do an `sudo apt-get clean` and then try the second one again .
you can use more complex regex , too
for an example
dfinitely : p
when the shell asks for a resume . the focus one is more a request to the shell than something
that is used in few apps without mainview ...
i would clean install
i 'm just trying to understand why it does n't work .
some products can be ran from playonlinux or wine aswell
heh , alas
i suppose it does
get an usb stick , delete/add partitions
no . just log out and back it - it 's that simple . ~/bin will be setup for you
putting a mail server on the web is not a `` toy ''
just be sure to make a backup of all your important files before installing ubuntu , in case something goes
should have use qmlproject , much simpler : )
so maybe the usb is broken and should not be used ? i deleted everything on it completely between the
as that is handled elsewhere
can you pastebin ( paste.ubuntu.com ) the output of `` ls *.img '' and the output from running the ddrescue
it 's a brand new box !
*please* file a bug about it
if i do what
note that i 'm talking about the sourcedir , not the builddir
just rename it back
i do n't use it
this is after running the oem-config .
that 's really weird
device dates will be announced by the oem , not by us
oh , is that a thing ? i use an opinel
yep . tested the error paths as well .
anyway , a handful from there
i 'm sure jhbuild is wonderful and all , but more than what i need , and , still we
ok , mutexes do n't help at all , as i thought ... .
even know there is oracle8 listed in my jvm folder its not listed on the list ... .
you 'd have to rename the slot
ok
i did n't mean do it in javascript : -d rather it would require a c++ plugin to achieve what
dpkg is the low-level tool .
ram ?
it says this command does not exist
he quit
logs and a bug would be great ( if you have n't gotten one already )
correct . it seems like i can
it is shipped on the phone , ureadit uses it
idk what that is .
more than tht
but apt-get should work ...
elopio i have a lunch invite at our standup time , maybe we could meet quickly earlier to let brendand

i fail to understand , and i do n't really have access to another device either
not close means , it 's the work desktop , im at home right now ... let me connect to
i got 40 servers . : )
oh , yeah , sorry , forgot that was only obvious to 3 people : -p
yeah , anyway the bug itself was completely crazy , looked like something not really code related
and to you as well
^
ok , will add it
there you go
well , you arent using ubuntu .
tal
sorry , i mean `` net view '' shows remote machines that w10 can see . since i 'm failing
yeah , i can try having a look to robustify , just went for the easy solution today to unblock
i 'd like to know if they are correct

sorry was fixing my typo : )
but the game is made for linux xd
cool.. how did you check ? are you up to date with upgrades ? can you login as the guest
are you up to date ?
unblock mate-media/1.10.0-1
yeah , but at least all bool vals should document what the default bool is
do you know if there will be a uos session on in ?
which should happen today in around an hour
oh , i am not worried about storage
disco /dev/sdb1 : 3138 mb , 3138682880 bytes
the click looks good , let 's in parallel wait for an answer whether you can upload it yourself and
we only switched on vivid testing today as kilo-1 is nearly done
i 'm always checking what debian did and eventually merge , but afaik , i did only touch here some
i rarely read this area , but it may help you and you have some evidence if there is anything
we never close previews when we open an app
yes ( i say `` boot firmware '' rather than bios as it covers uefi based and bios based boot
was able to create the images with the uk vpn
no , cherylj is looking into it
the alarm is set in 6 days
how do you do vivid ?
i did n't see that , sorry , but i wanted to check the logic : )
when i picked the download page with google i have overlooked the `` next '' in the url and the
it 's working pretty well
like our docs : )
manual sync is not what i need
could be , my internet have not been too great .
ok
i have zero experience with ubuntu touch interface and programming for that
ok , than it 's not related to panels .
ah right , forgot about that
sure
: d
we ca n't use tasks in conjunction with the hwe upgrades , because we ca n't change tasks post-release .
systemd-sysv is functionally priority : required in debian according to debootstrap , even if the overrides do n't say that
is that all you need from me ?
this is :
yeah , ubuntu-unity team is the only reason you or i can publish at all ; - )
but i am always happy to try and break things : - )
its mostly stuff like presentation slides or something.. i sometimes have libreoffice crash on me and then it can not
i used the `` creat an install dvd '' , the icon for which i locatdd in dash- > c

want wily and vivid to be in sync , both with trunk + this mr
you never answered my question
no , actually i plan on this being an irc bot
occasional guest memory corruption , basically
i use lenovo ... depends on what you are using and whether you are using nvidia optimus technology
: ) sending you a killer video is : )
whats happening now ?
well , you can of course iterate over a fetcher.items , each item will have a uri and a description
via a dumb switch to eth2 on the microserver . nothing else is plugged into the dumb switch
: )
you do n't have a second cursor ?
you mean the apple guys ?
no not like that the bottom of the screen was corrupted on any scroll . it looked like distortion or
is there a way to get ./update to work with proposed ?
hah , bad joke . 12.04 lts release was named 'precise ' , 14.04 codenamed 'trusty ' . : p
you do n't happen to have `` systemctl cat mnt-hgfs.mount '' , do you ?
ok
i mean just for the first one . once the first build is complete then parallel builds can resume
at the core sprint in 10 days ? no , desktop is not invinted , we have our own week
ok
for continuous updates we would need some sort of backend that triggers them
hmm ... . actually you 're right ! the selected is actually the focus ...
yeah that 's what i 'm thinking
sorry , should have been part of my instructions
the trick is this : the osk is opened
what does it say ?
i hope that the address book app 's failure on xenial does not block our ota9 landing to vivid overaly
small channel cant help much right
what you think ?
np
echan ? : )
oh , heh , i missed that : ) nice
looking
i dont have windows 7 here , and its not free for me to check it
i have to leave now ; others can give further advice on accessing files
it 's really not great , if you only tried one backup superblock with the above guide , maybe try
since this is lenny i ca n't access repo
so when i use phablet-dev-bootstrap it just pulls down a prebuilt rootfs ?
the only question in my concern is the onscreen keyboard issue
pardon haha ?
just getting you the dmesg and syslog : )
i *have* , and am currently attempting
we have an interesting race because of fallback scopes
let 's jump in moonstone
so , there is an admin form for picking the branch we want , right ?
shared folder or the vm file ?
oh . then you 're either screwed or infinity is going to be peeved . xd
if you want a restore , do a full clean install
that means it is gone no solution for that ?
have you tryed other drivers from additional drivers section ?
detecting upstart is harder , but on ubuntu you can assume that it 's upstart if it 's not systemd
that is an option in uefi
i did n't have any problems yesterday with the ubiquity installer at all , all went smoothly
if you were , nano would pull it up just fine .
i 'm still wondering about if i should just give up and have it all in bazaar
pavucontrol ( source : pavucontrol ) : pulseaudio volume control . in component universe , is optional . version 3.0-3build1
telegram is pretty nice , but no video for now
right , but is kio present in vivid , so we could refer to it now ? or will that
let me see
yeah i guess so
have you launched sublime from the terminal before ?
its in the ubuntu repos since 14.10. for 14.04 you need a ppa for that
did you have to do that ? what does it do ?
i have let it run
is there not a plain 'lvm ' option ?
what do you think is the version ?
what needs doing ?
what are you actually working on and do you have your code available somewhere ?
322
two libsdl based games in the store !
i 'm checking out scrounge-ntfs seems promising
can you tell me what you 're doing with policy-rc thing there ? i 'm not familiar with that
but it is not , that 's the problem
well , preferably .
then continues to fail
i do n't see how untrusted apps can share data through individual access
`` the `` rom '' lives on system-image.ubuntu.com ... '' maybe , but for me it was difficult in the
it would randomly drop 33 % of calls
that can be accomplished from the desktop image , with the right know-how .
i ungraded last week for all my machines .
if i can reproduce the buffer overflow , most probably i can fix it
i disabled it . but ok , it 's enabled now . copied text is there , even when closing
this `` ca n't delete a thing '' happen everytime when i 'm trying to delete a lot of files
i 've never published it , it 's very far away from being finished^^
i am told to use network-manager but i dont even know how to use that
thnx
if you press the escape key during the splash screen it should show you the text
here there 's also an example of the drag & drop feature : )
yeah , looks like unity-scope-click and -autopilot are uninstallable on proposed
not an ubuntu issue . stay on topic or go to # ubuntu-offtopic
i.e . use tmpfs
yes
feeling better today ?
ca n't i compile something and run ?
ask camako i guess
there is also bug 126672
is build-time what upstream does ?
i should have specified the full path instead of via the symlink - just habit
mit will accept you without any test
try 14.04.3 lts
also what issue do you have with my file exists change ?
no problem , best of luck !
wait a second ... actually the source file is a symlink , created by click
right , but this is a packaging issue
default being kernel crash dump is enabled
quite good , a small problem yesterday with fonts-oxygen install , but forcing it managed to get it done ,
yes that 's the answer i was looking for
hmm could remount read-write i guess
try the main mirrors
yeah , snaps cant write outside their defined space
echo $ ( dpkg -- get-selections | grep install | cut -f1 ) | sudo apt-get install -- reinstall ...
sorry , this may be ubuntu specific .
i 'm talking to someone about it on # juju now , i suspect it 's not a maas problem
so this is more tomcat world than snappy world , but either you dump webapps preinstalled in the tomcat runtime
if all is ok with the packages those should migrate to the release pocket soon
toolkit has n't had either ...
i use konversation but not on my 15.04 machine
something better supported ? security is using wpa2 personal right now
it 's self-hosting ?
ok , i have to do a little bit of work now . i 'll be back for sure .
yeah , try sudo chown -r < your user > : /home/ < your user >
darn : / i really wanted to play with this beautiful phone : )
it seems you 're already using the i386 architecture , and that package `` libgnutls-deb0 '' is the 32-bit version

yeah mps are obviously way more transparent than manual source uploads .
you can start with sd to hack on it : )
ok , i understand
if i draw a surface twice in my qml scene . should each item there have a different compositor ``

uh , no
why is shutoff considered to be alive ?
i do n't think that is supported here , it 's mainly what is in the ubuntu repos , i

do n't make direct eye-contact or it 's gon na crack !
you should take the data off and not use a mac drive anymore
graphics driver issue , what gpu do you have ?
linux is just the kernel
i read a lot of the current britney code recently ; mostly the bits that directly interact with autopkgtest ,
so if i change the place we set the environment variables no tests fail ( at least not for proxyupdater
and the chroot in your mounted partition
not yet
or baobab from ubuntu
even optimised it using variables for retries and enoughretries to patch it only once , final problem is now the
waiting for a few other bits , so we 'll see
you can install on any ... my ubuntu system 14.04 uses only 6gb . you can use the big disk

yes , that little trick usually works then it does n't work tools such as unetbootin
32bit efi and 64bit kernel and userland with kernel 3.15 and above

what why

no . disabling again tells me it 's already disabled . otherwise they run fine
you could just use the tag 's id ( ) , which would return the number
right , but does n't that confirm that you 've limited the available cpus so dom0 has only 1 ?
is the plan still to let the default adjust to available space ?
laterz and good luck
so i know about the release , and i know it 's fixed upstream , and i know the solution
i use one at work because i was not supposed to install ubuntu in the main drive
i dont have any printers in ubuntu besides 'print to file '
what 's currently landing ?
hope to see you there !
oh , and in these cases it does n't show the stack trace at all ?
is this disc bricked , any history to give us some context ? do you have a windows computer to
what machine is that ?
strangely it does not work in crontab one minute from now either .
right i remember now : /
sorry for all the pings today !
we can contribute to the ucs project and i would be happy to take under the official ubuntu sdk umbrella
cool , a little faith no more i suggest .
it 's very dependant on the app , tried exactly the same app form the bug ?
1.20.8.1 is either a custom build or juju built using upload-tools , it is not an official release and not
and seeing if you can update your backup
uname -a
000
did you get an email about that ?
but the same branch in spirit ( just a bunch of newer commits since yesterday )
ace , both halves ?
yes . 1920x1080 only appears below `` edid version : 1.3 '' : `` preferred mode : 1920x1080 ''
i still have the error environment up . do you want any additional information before i destroy-environment ?
tldr the issue
that pipelight repo entry would never work so it could n't have provided a source for whatever pipelight is
i did fresh install cause was using xorg edgers ppa , so too much hassle with purging it before release
do n't like working from the office ?
the nicest thing about it is that , aside from the resources required to run a second process , and
sorry , i meant lxpanel
where 's your backports ?
oh , i did n't see the traceback , so unicode indeed .
also extracted
have rebooted multiple times
dell xps 15 ( early 2015 )
udp or tcp ?
you can check with iwconfig
ping
memory usage
next week perhaps : p
nah not really : s when it 's the only display natively on dvi , i take it it runs
i guess you 'll have to look for them yourself ( the bugs ) , you can use greybird 's
you have joined an ubuntu channel , for support issues
this isnt general linux mate , we can only support ubuntu related issues sorry
i 'll do , my guess is that my use of network interfaces is wrong , tomorrow i 'll review
normally by the cpu brand & modelnumber
there was this other guy from phonedations that came to me with a bug about it .
sudo rfkill list all
yeah , i usually use tun/tap bridge setups too , which might be why i never noticed that user ``
did you buy and ubuntu edition ? ( see sturmflut 's post )
first : sudo fdisk -l
unless header declares a context inside and add the actions to that context
how would you do it ?
it is certainly available on the device
nothing like that .
what ime are you using ?
all set for the team q & a ?
ubuntu 's default installation and repositories do not include packages needed to play commercial dvds for legal reasons . for
sorry , sudo umount /mnt/root
the home folder is the tricky part , we opted for having an actual local home folder ( which is
it is not a new machine . it never happened before . how can i fix it ?
then there is libc6 ; do we want those libs in the snap or should they be allowed as dangling
my vcd is not detected at all .
`` man bc '' and see sections numbers and variables about 'scale '
no problem ; )
and what is the stack you 've got you 're exporting ?
ok
i mean , did you even look at what you pastebinned ? look at lines 6-15
things are well : )
no , that 's expected : the first question is about our policy , the google login page is google
the dch tool by default does n't allow adding a new version that is smaller than the previous one
non existant , except in the ui . they will exist again some day .
anyway - so if xfce wants people to test this stuff - i assume as vanilla xfce , which is
see i could of done spiderpig for that one : d
ok i will look for codecs format on synaptic but im sure i have installed all the possible codecs already
yeah thats an option
it does n't at all : d
that should never happen unless the d.add for the service is executed after the initial d.setup
another fine way of testing would be to toss into the fire and see if there any glowing inscriptions in
is it a regular card or is that from the 80s too ?
you mean in the feature tests or ?
you said you were in centos with putty , use the correct channel , come on .
true
are you happy just tracking the issues on 1446499
ahh right
what did you try to do ? how did you try to do it ? what did you expect to
no the repository your package manager or apt connects to for package installation
probably
i see , ok
yeah
you mean the board will have had `` accidents '' on the way ?
could be but i do n't even see the widget flicker
yeah , any problems with the channel , questions around it 's usage etc etc
when i try to install python-xapian states i already have latest vervion . sould i purge and re-install ?
can you try something
how can i do it ?
have a good one
kde is not a theme .
when is going to be the ugj ( or dev event ) after this one ?
you misspelled dependencies . : )
can you have a closed-source ppa ? i thought the build machines had to build all the debs ?
join # ubuntu+1
sure will run it and get back after a restart .
no worries , it should be easy
what 's the point of your link , i 'm talking about the program not the insect .
yes , that is whati checked too first ...
sudo apt-get install gnome-system-monitor
right , doublecheck your additional drivers
calendar for events in loco 's
i 'm only part way through my first coffee is my excuse and i 'm sticking to it
: ) i hope that it pans out as well as we 're thinking it will .
is that the delegated team concept ?
we keep 10+ projects in one tree as this is much easier to work with ( it 's one project
and ?
i wonder if the 'incomplete ' status is why it 's not showing
no its not , there are several ways to do this . but you did not describe a specific problem
no i do n't
any that support openvpn
but yeah , as a dev it 's clearly a feature
but , ymmv , i dunno .
use dist-upgrade
ok
i know you removed the proxy bits from /etc/environment and .bashrc , but let 's see if they 're still
so it 's not a g-k issue , it 's just this part of the dash not setting the env
one last question , will you release something before the end of 15.10 development ?
add to element with class .skepost
what ?
i know that - still my problem is getting a piece of software requiring glibc 2.17 running on 12.10 .
this is the ubuntu support channel , ask # # linux for advice on choosing a distro
i branched from lp : indicator-sound and tried to merge back to it .
and some simple qml tests apps too
unless you 're working on an lvm setup , yeah , it 'll do what you want .
there is no `` ubuntu touch '' product . it is just ubuntu . `` ubuntu-touch '' is just the
if that 's what you 're looking for then you open software center and go to view > new applications
just to be clear : you do n't need silo 004 , just demo-stuff
that is a good question to which i have to refer you to cking , which does n't work
not upgrade , sudo apt-get update , try please
`` status '' works , or `` list '' for that matter
but since qml has no way to read/write/open files it does not make much sense i 'd say
p7zip ?
right , but how do snaps handle it when they depend on a tool which went away ?
pastebin the output of `` df -h '' and `` df -i '' please .
no need . only ^ those two steps will fix it for you
assuming your partition is /dev/sda
you can also issue the export path= command to have it take effect for this session , so you can
we know the bad line ; )
then you definitely are not using *buntu . sorry , you are in the wrong channel .
then why is the unhibernate process so quick ?
the phone is based off of vivid release so 15.04
numbers 12345 included or not ?
the original issue is : i ca n't live migrate instances from qemu 1.5 to qemu 2.0 .
let us know if the copy works out any better , now
yes , updated and upgraded and as far as i can tell no ppa packages are getting installed
process/context
silo 11 is android
do `` sudo mkdir /target ; mount /dev/mapper/ubuntu -- vg-root /target ''
ram issue on certain locations
the guy building packages and making sure the dependencies are correct
i will update nuage accordingly
why not ?
what i want is : i do nothing , osx boots normally , i hold alt - i can select
silo is always nicer , one gets the diff from the build job etc that 's easier to double-check
so it 's a language , so i need it to access application written in java in the web right
it gives me more
i left my comments in the bug thread , but i 'll sum up here
kgunn : looks like he said his phone was wily , i mean is he running wily or vivid on
where did you find the system.img ?
ok , so i can have a `` ssh root @ server1.com '' or `` ssh test @ server1.com ''
they said `` xml feeds ''
`` tl ; dr '' ? ?
the signature is ipaddress ( value string ) ... and here value is taken as the docid . but the
will do
hmm ... there 's a way of checking if the rootfs built but i never remember the links for that
ah , ok
the emoticon looked correct in my irc client
i 'll do some tinkering . in the meantime do you know how i can disable ipv6 in the network
remount the disk read-write and run their uninstall script
the size of the window has some influence on positioning ...
no problem
use software center , and it will show you the version of the package you have installed
the login code uses generate_nick to create a unique name .
what ops do in other channels is n't our conecern , if you have an ubuntu support question , please
yeah ! it 's amazing , i used to use urandom until i discovered that trick : )
no , *not* in /var/log/mail/ , but in /var/log/
`` file- > see revision history ... ''
both
srry . how do i check that ? ( i only have ssh access right now )
ah , doh
the train will put ubuntu in the symbols version though , that should be the same on all arches
if you do n't ask a real question we ca n't help you
cool , let us know how it goes . please remember to ping the vanguard .
in your first paste , there are priority numbers , eg 100 , 1001 , 500. if a ppa is
^
now how can i see his traffic , my router does not contain os i guess
no . i am trying to write one
got it , i was just surprised that it 's creating an image ... .rather than downloading some prebuilt thing
dpkg -l | grep -i maria
eh , it sounds exactly like what we want
if you want , i can give you access to the site , or a bug on developer-ubuntu-com will do
that i will
but after a reboot domain users no longer work
awesome ! 11.15 pounds with royalmail or 25 pounds with dhl
make sure you have snmp package installed on the maasserver as well
you could always get the release !
no , it 's ok
ok , the ci people to ping , are they on this channel ? or should i go to another
good stuff
breakfast of champions
save the cluster controller config again
thats not the issue
to install , it makes you compile all of your packages .
but i do n't see linux-headers ... .all_deb in that page
yeah , i 'd say it should behave intuitively , which is to preserve ar unless you tell it not
what else have you put in / besides the os , or is it small ?
noo , i have no experience rebuild system packages on ubuntu
yes
because the ue calendar is packed full . so what i do is to look at it and see which
that 's the default for trusty if you are n't on hwe , right .
yes , unfortunately a lot of failed attempts .
imgur.com
updating to latest edge to see if it 's there yet
yes i ran it as `` lp_disable_ssl_certificate_validation=1 lp-shell dev devel ''
it should give you something like this : ii ubuntu-desktop 1.325 i386 the ubuntu desktop system
the name does n't matter except that its bound to some action somewhere
but qtmir test plan includes connecting a monitor
that 's the `` 00:17.0 raid bus controller [ 0104 ] : intel corporation sata controller [ raid mode ]
that 's not the right way , of course ...
i did several times a while ago but am waiting for someone who 's able s.t . i do n't
hmm i wonder if blank newlines are not being stripped , bzrlib wo n't parse subsequent patches otherwise .
okay dokay
should it ? there is strong argument for both .
finished , see # 394
the haslen failures are a little hard to read ...
i wanted to know more . thats it .
it is not the package currently in the repositories with new patches ; it is a new release . the
-_-
when it hangs see the resource level , that would be a good starting point
it 's being called with a nil errer
will you help me with kwin ?
ok , reviewing now
it is enabled : (
create for wily , and get that sponsored first
that good eh ?
that sounds like hit enter whilst having not closed a set of quote marks . try typing a single-quote or
correct . no sound output .
well yeah - no i get the next sigsys .. seems like the worker processes get killed of
claudiupopa : so that change gives us consistent behaviour on python 2 and 3 .
so no boot when doing that ? are you bzr bd'ing by any chance ?
now that 's a weird one ! never seen that before !
yeah , i set it back to 'incomplete ' - even tested a dist-upgrade on a production server i know
there was a ~ubuntu-server-contribs iirc , trying to mimic the contributing developer thing.. but it did n't grow , so
do you imaging a devpack is a just an app snap with known paths that we mount into the sysroot
well boot a live session and check : )
lsmod | grep ath10k does it return anything
and keep this build for the makers .
or the other way round , you can get access to the armhf runners , and then just check what
what is the make of ethernet card in your machine
podbird , no idea about the music app side of things
ah - i was just wondering if i was wrong about the problem .
i know restarting unity8 so much is slightly unusual but it *could* happen in normal usage i guess
slightly less concerned about commandline upgrades , unless it 's horribly broken , and your report sounded less `` horribly
regardless , it 's a problem of virtualbox not accepting the ctrl event . this is not handled by the

yeah , fails here , too
what ?

i 'm getting sigill in gdb , so looking into what exactly is going on
on a clean vm with no git config
no
maybe you should adopt a similar stance to nvidia as you do with oracle ; )
here is closed source , i want osm maps too : )
this doesnt look right 34.231884 ] systemd-logind [ 1132 ] : failed to start unit user @ 112.service : unknown
k , no worry ; - ) had fun there ?
hmm , ok , add the option `` -- no-install-recommends '' and try again
no big deal ; we do n't really need all those
does anything make it `` recover '' ? or once it starts tearing continues thru reboot ?
yeah , mac really took the developer community
that is what i 've been trying , but the files are not being deleted
it says to me that pep8 depends on python3-pep that is no longer available , so it errors out
when i do a grep of backlight , i ca n't see any line
it is playstation styled , but it is for computers only
no , we do n't know where you 're trying to visit - nor why it 's an ubuntu problem
: )
nice !
so , you are n't fixing the bug you just reported with the changes you are doing ?
ok , i 'll duplicate it then
i might be able to catch it before it copies out
i work for myself , and in 1998 win95 was costing me on average 1 to 2 hours per day
after running cmake it works now
but i assume it 's an actual vps .
storageprovision/schedule.go
yes , does it error ?
even if it doesnt run properly , it doesnt matter . mount the guest additions cd , and run the
try pressing esc when the pc boots , see if you have a boot options menu
this an apple computer ?
have u saved the crontab ?
sure
k
the apt-get update ignores all the cdrom ones
it 's build failed , but it only says silo dirty
y u no edubuntu !
did n't knome volunteer for making the panel layouts we ship with xfpanel-switch ? : )
gksudo phpstorm
is that on 1.24 ?
is this specific to ubuntu ?
cd/usb/netboot/boot-iso/etc etc
but it needs to mount using a userspace file system
is there a reason why you do n't think that the user was n't setup properly ?
oh ... sounds like you moved , not copied , the content
is the scheme you want , just one fat 32 partition ?
well , this was working fine really , but when tried to tinker with some games the lack of hardware
with the exception of some mouse cursor issues , demo servers work as expected ( using mir_demo_server from lp :
you silly bot
not yet .
no bookmarks , even ?
of course
yes , i tried ...
no i 'm not asking for help on the vmware issue . i am asking for help on the ubuntu
i do n't have it installed : / and apt-get would n't work as i 'm not connected to the
ping
the issue is i cant even get the ap part to work
anyway ; so this is n't done through click packages ?
let me try to reproduce locally with mesa and demo servers and i will get back to you
when you have a moment , could you help with creating some command tests . they are fine until i
to properly bring the system down . ' sudo shutdown -h now ' ( r to reboot ) .
try a nomodeset perhaps , or check your syslog and dmesg for grafix errors
is there a gmail channel - they windows think it 's a gmail thing .
i did not get you
ok , added that other include too , let 's hope .
then it 's a master and a slave or something - in any case we end up with two databases
was this after you install the ppa version ?
bq aquarius 4.5 ubuntu touch
jhutchins ; i get it . fine ...
though as usual , packages that never built wo n't count against proposed migration
14.10 is eol , dead .
type /join # kali-linux
ah , i have that too ; i figure i said `` gedit '' for one case where a website
the mailing list should be setting the reply-to
yes .
and # webdev
sudo service networking restart
both my existing sid schroot and my freshly created one hang eternally with apt-get
so it 's something to do with just usage inside a gui session then
bit of a catch-22 .
that will install a tool to paste correctly in the channel
yup , i am working with proxies from past 1.5 yr. and currently on arch
not change , just test first in the live mode
# # hardware
just grab a lts to test ?
i have a couple bugs to look at really quickly
then what is the use of nis , ldapand kerberos ? ?
once you get a review in the review queue log in will start working for you
heh . check .
me too
nevermind , we do , but the menu content is lagging , as usual
have you tried to boot in recovery mode ?
that 's the only thing i can think of , unless it 's an ec2 problem
let me check that
get alot of request lately dont you : p
i was reading earlier today that it does it based on imei
so how is this going to proceed
every card/system performs otherwise on different drivers
sudo service lightdm restart
ask after the point release is out .
may be powering off and then holding down volume ( + ) volume ( - ) and power buttons for
yes , why ?
soo looking at the usc code some more , it seems that the message set active session is sent from
system-image-cli 2.5.1
quick pm though , semi-important
did you upgrade recently the kernel via apt-get upgrade , dist-upgrade ?
wow , that lxd/shared.gencert function is awful . have you filed a bug to their project to de-awful it ?
axxess
but i just installed it through package manager and ran it from the menu . yes with plasma 5 .
right . xdg-mime bug .
as i 've already said , you do n't install software this way .
let me run it again
you can reach this by alt+f2 and searching for `` rules '' also
for any significant vulnerability , there should be a timely security update of the official package .
might be xcursor specific
the 2nd line from your pastebin says you are trying to install cloud-init mountall postgresql , etc ... . those
no drama
segfault
it can , even if there are still one small stuff to debug on this front ...
concern addressed ; i 've removed those files .
these are files on my flashdrive , there must be a way to delete them .
i use vim when i edit on a remote server . but we use ansible and config management , so
aaaahhh ! i probably found the cause of the second issue too ! ! ! sda2 is really not aligned
upload/push script
fast ?
running it non daemon will display what the app is doing verbosely
factories for unit testing , a dev turnip instance for in-browser experimentation
is it on sstable or only edge ?
where do we hangout now ? #
it 's exposed over iscsi , so it 's already a raid-6
i killed the gui , and dpkg disappeared
have you been able to create one ( and upgrade to e.g . 15.10 ) ?
i suspect you 'd find those on the ubuntu flavor team launchpad
yes , there is a link ?
it installed four packages total
sorry i was distracted and misunderstood you .
really not ! how are you doing ?
but the link refers to reporting bugs in the packaging .
try just starting your script as an @ reboot cron job . that 's how i 'm handling all of
tim suggested that the server should pull the agents without judging the series/os they are for .
most likely no , the bios does n't like when the partition table is changed usually and the recovery wont
not supported here , sorry
yeh , kinda needed for the transition
ok , makes sense , the earlier yyyyh was to the issue i 'm investigating now ; )
which is have the header hidden when you open the doc , and single tapping on the doc will toggle
how do you feel about exposing colour settings for the content peer picker ? i see the mhall119 has already
see that link from the bot ^
well i was just gon na require packages
you do n't over-ride it ; you just select a different mode to the 'preferred ' mode
after boot ctrl alt f1 to login
luckily for you , i pulled 1.23 less than an hour ago : )
yes ! also some boring errands . had to buy a dust mop , too
it is still running ...
compiling yourself is n't a typically supported action , so it 's unlikely someone will reply
did you try the external ip of your router ?
mixing repos is a sure fire way to break your system , unfortunately it is n't really something you undo
the contrary
you could copy it back if you wanted
so this branch fixes the ui bug , which is mostly what the bug report is about , the ui
before you get off , what is the right way to sideload webm ?
upstart is meant to replace the old sys v init system with an event-driven init model . for more information
do you reckon that might be the issue then ? this current laptop uses raid0 ssd 's , i 'm
hah , nice : )
hold on ill brb
hmm this is where the code path is coming from for a make event
the same you used before to make it owned by root . just exchange the root with www-data now
when i tried booting from live usb , it displayed 2 boot devices for the same usb drive - one
`` apt-cache show linux-generic-lts-utopic '' and note the supported : at the end
dunno , never used it .
so , if you can some up with something workable in the next 5 or 6 hours ? if you
besides , i 'm including the deps in the device tarball rootfs part
if you saw the shit my company has in production
it 's ubuntu 14.04 right ?
when i remove upstart , they 're gone . when i install it , they 're back . how do
anything i can do to help ?
no , it just gives me command usage syntax
use the keyboard arrows to navigate and adjust all the volume sliders , but particularly check that `` pcm ''
i always thought that was about a pleasent phucker
that fails the same .
thx
thedac , gnuoy : idea - use ddt for interface testing
try sudo cgdisk /dev/sda and change the type to 8300
as i said , it depends on the application , not the distirbution
just to make sure i am understanding ... you are saying to run : linux-image-3.19.0-42-generic
ca n't say , i 'm afraid ; cjwatson/infinity would know better
i care primarily about capacity and speed
yeahp .
it is in the repos
ty
patterns are the canonical way to communicate a solution , at least from my pov
maybe look into bios , if settings are correcly
if i have some library code for my charm 's reactive hooks , where should that live in the charm
well that would explain that then
terminal is weird because it does n't use a gtkscrolledwindow
yeah it is locked
btw , pb has a race wrt to start and finish calls
probably using some other method
orthogonal though , do n't get tangled up trying to fix all the things at once
sad to say way beyond my narrow range of `` expertise '' , but no doubt more experienced people here
yeah , i know how that goes . i have a 1-year-old myself
right-o . i can have a look at completing that transition , but would be nice to verify the segfaults
is indicator-datetime-service running ?
in the terminal , aplay -l
i like this : - )
hmm , but that was already correct in greyback 's invocation ...
ok here it is : ( hd0 ) ( hd0 , gpt3 ) ( hd0 , gpt2 ) ( hd0
excusing my bad cut & paste
builds wo n't automatically be created . you can either upload a new version or copy the package over itself
in no particular order
yes . you can use the charms.reactive cli tool and call get_states
i will reboot and see if it switched
none of that code is *good* , it 's just better than it was in some respects ; )
yeah , i 'm not certain about hunspell 's affix stuff ; it might just be for handling less common
no , that 's mainline - run vivid official . 3.19.0-26 i believe it 's at - install linux-generic
does this persist over reboots ?
so in the nested server code paths you have server api 's calling client apis behind the scenes to talk
lol if it aint one thing , it 's something else to configure : )
i run xubuntu , i don ; t know where it is in unity
fwiw , i do n't mind how we organize the makefile
ok. be back in a sec .
the stupid client makes assumptions about its host to decide what to upload to the series and since 1.20.x does
fixed the doctest , will grab some lunch and look at the smoketest failures
having upstart split the same way as systemd is split would be nice .
too fast . : p
ttp : //paste.ubuntu.com/13547571/
right ... it 's all irc 's fault for complete strangers giving random instructions : )
yes ping works from this laptop to the server . ioria : i have gien the server a static ip
probably , but it gets a chance
thumper : are these both with master ?
ask in # freenode
the store scope calls activate too
ok . i 'll examine my environment .
k .
i tried holding shift and pressing it many times ... with shift do n't work
well both
yup , it 's using the chromeos kernel .
you already have lightdm
lolo
look into the grub-install command
try hitting enter a couple times in one of those
yes .. thats the 3 chars .. i got into mind
axw : do you know what the procedure is meant to be for merging a feature branch , by any
we did include the acl capabilities before 219 , right ?
yeah , no . if you truly want an answer , do n't troll here . ask elsewhere .
as i said , type `` ubuntu-bug thermald ''
well , 2fa has been on for a week now
`` no space left on device '' is pretty obvious , and expectec when running `` sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb
i am in a qabstractvideosurface : : present implementation
mvo and i are there
we are trying to add mate menu , mate tweak and caja-actions to debian .
darn , any that can be deleted ?
you have silo55 installed i assume ?
there 's /etc/init.d too
you need lmsensors installed
i could try removing my configuration and see how it boots
so ... booting in windows it works ? you did n't mention that before
ah ok well
whats the issue ?
its because i am running a local test site in apache and a bunch of images to be served is
i 'd adopt it into 48 , but 48 is a high risk still for not being ready
oh , right..
ooh yes let 's ask for testers
yeah i did n't mean that this image would be official , but perhaps someday in the near future .
no ... wtf is the key in dockey ?
did you flip the switch for gallery-app ?
true . ver 2.0 is supposed to be a major improvement
please pastebin the output of `` lspic '' .
it works
sdc is all ntfs is that a wubi install ?
hello : )
so what about the idea of putting the output into the messages log instead of a popup ?
yes , thats why use the first solution , not the one that has only 1 `` upvote ''
you cant sign a file if you dont have a key to sign with .
let 's check explicitly anyway . please pastebin the output of `` apt-cache policy pulseaudio '' .
nice pics
he was just warning you , not personal ... you 'd be surprised as the the lack of knowledge that
what does it say ?
i run 14.04.1 64bit on an old amd 3200 , rocketfast with ssd and old ati x800 : p
i see , wish i knew more about akondadi and kmail
they may as well , no point in them being idle
killing /usr/lib/policykit-1/polkitd -- no-debug
125 % means all of one core and 25 % of the next
woohooo \o/
sorry to be pita - is this just a case of it timing out ?
maybe you could set another combo key to print as a temporary fix
but no need for a bunch of versioned build-deps , just wait until it 's published on all arches according
on a storage drive it should not matter
sudo apt-get upgrade & & sudo apt-get install openssh-server should work for you .
can we please make sure to open bugs for the scenarios that do not work
we 'd always love more packagers
but it 's should be trivial - i 'll get on it now , and ask you for a review
i 'd suggest moving usb to the top of the list if that is possible
writing to a usb drive is different from writing to a cd
in the future , clicks will probably also come to the desktop
i meant that after now that it is fixed , push it , to see that it remains stable
oh , whee . did n't think about that ugliness .
jep
im starting to think its not about the card , but uefi messing
my general point is that python libraries working are part of charms working and therefore part of a good charming
how do i check the partition type now ?
no , adrian47 is porting to a new device and asks sensible questions ; though that one was a bit
you did , : ) one less palce to look for
only seen versions : juju-core 1.20.14
tell me
in any case , you have to backup smb.conf , add a new [ global ] and [ data ]
or # # linux maybe
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 281272 lis 12 18:29 /usr/sbin/lightdm
it would also mean the forward port would be accomplished by merging the older branch into the newer one (
processing bzr uploads every 15min between legacy and new servers that have to stay in sync and take a while
yes but you tested different version of lubuntu no ?
squid proxy can just be for internet traffic
yes . the installer is a full linux kernel running so it 'll recognise all hardware , it jsut has
it will simply copy it bit by bit
well ... as long as i have no more big surprises should be sunday or monday .
when you do sudo you have root
i 'm afraid i do n't understand that question
however i can also handle that in the statesaver backend , so it 'll be global disabled if that si
you dont know wich to choose yet ?
seems as such ... .
i 'll repeat the test for trunk , but i bet it has the same issue and i just did
working on serialized data in content-hub transfers ... fun stuff !
yes i did and also dist-upgrade
awesome work ; )
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
let 's see what space we have
yes , when ubuntu-device-flash assembles the image , it writes the stuff under raw-files 'raw ' at the specified disk
yeah , i 'll cancel it and update our package
how much ram was installed in the system when it was installed ?
from the wiki testplan : gdbus call -- session -d com.ubuntu.accountpolld -o /com/ubuntu/accountpolld -m com.ubuntu.accountpolld.poll
qt_qpa_platform=ubuntumirclient
no argument there ... but i thought we were talking about the series in metadata work
which light-locker-command
if you do `` /join # debian '' you 'll be fine
are you registered on launchpad ?
i did have a bug come in on kdevelop , but fixed and pushed : )
blinkenlights ?
is n't that what we keep them around for ?
that explodes indeed
did you change usernames ?
we are not using app_id though , we quesry the app name from qguiapplication
do you have firewall on ?
page.header.leadingactionbar.delegate : dekkobutton { onclicked : popups.open ( `` dekkopanel.qml '' ) }
try again
oh i see now , you installed ubuntu on the 2nd hdd sdb
flash installer for linux
open a terminal , type `` mount '' , copy teyt to a pastebin , show the pastbin url here
pulseaudio start/running , process 8244
it would reduce complexity ...
so go to the top and click on make a new partition table , accept msdos , after that finishes
in which order asshole ?
no , i do n't . not where i am right now
but since i have not yet gone through a mir handling that is more the unknown lands
it 's there in 15.04
how 's yours ?
you can now assign your own from the spreadsheet , enjoy ; - )
for most flavors , the issue with the metapackage transition has resulted in missing/additional packages , which is to say
give xubuntu or kubuntu a try .
what kind of system ?
what docker hack ?
ok , understood .
why not install lubuntu then ?
why is it not empty
that 's not required with apt ... i was just sharing .
note in the folder ui/ there is contenthubopener.cpp
its already there
where in the world are you this evening then ?
is this on a fat partition ?
and in between folks can download/checkout the charms and use them locally on the in-between releases
ah , ok , which version did you get ?
ahhh ... sorry . i 'm running qtmir from my test laptop , so there 's no usc there of
perhaps they could weigh in further
nope
it 's still better than what we currently have , so if spacing is hard maybe let 's land that
how does the world in snappy list look like ?
tar -zxvf >
what version of ubuntu are you attempting to update ?
it certainly seems like the right place to look at
what are you trying to do with grub if you dont mind me asking ?
you can use juju-deployer to deploy the bundle
i agree , it would be nice if systemd would pick up the ( new ) sysv init script automatically
ah makes sense
like in trusty , you 'll see that we have -generic and -generic-lpae from the mainline `` linux '' source
resizing is a little glitchy
already followed these but still the same problem . it runs manually but not after reboot
we 're doing the `` snaps fixes that '' so so soon in this conversation ?
oh , comment 13 led me to believe it needed fixing in wily
aaaahhh ! it 's the gui version , is n't it ?
rtm
rough plan is that official dgit-maintained repositories will live in git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/blah , personal branches will live in git.launchpad.net/~user/ubuntu/+source/blah
how can i get ubuntu mate added to beta 2 ?
i did try that , there was another error
that 's actually an interesting theory ... . well , they 're all ext4 , but it does just so
ok
you could try to troubleshoot with one of the alternative command-line tty if it 's a graphics problem ?
what kinf od graphics card does your system have ?
that works
sure , waiting for him to get online
hrmm , well let me know if there si something outstanding ...
i am not working on push client anymore : - (
parseerror
just the hdd or windows too ?
well now that you 're aware that i 'm aware , you should stop it . final warning .
of eve
as nicomachus says , if the pc has jumpers for resetting the eeprom , use those .
if unity , the unity tweak tool may have a switch
i do apt-cache search mozroots and nothing is returned i will try one more step and see if it works
yes
you could do a brief demo of it running to get people excited
why did you not get along with the bq ?
i 've had to ignore lxc for a bit to get the chroot stuff working , so it may be
like what ?
qmltests
because it 's a support channel , not a chat one .
let 's table any changes there to after this iteration is complete ( make a card )
yeah the icon is there
is the plan to expand that to other devices as well or not
during previous test the dconf keys were ok
do n't start that again ; - )
i have no cpp code as of yet ... just started making the main gui so just grabbing ideas
today , ubuntu for phones is a toplevel product that we maintain with a vision of how the user experience
i use it with nvidia ( 1 mgpu and 2 external gpus ) , never had a problem .
can you run `` juju -- debug ssh $ whatever_you're_sshing_to ?
reseat ? reseating is just generally unplugging and plugging it back in ?
cloning and starting works fine
i 'm not fluent in acronyms - expand jfdi for me please
was it an upgrade or a clean install of 14.04 server ?
maybe its something else lagging ?
we should always have a community track !
did ubuntu work properly before on your ssd ?
so how are things in the land of xubuntu ?
you know about vis as well ? could be useful having a menuitem to launch that
mir_server_session_mediator_report and _connetion_report = log are the most basic logs for server interactions
no nothing broken . but probably worth checking why it 's in proposed for so long
yeah : /
there is no such device sold with ubuntu on it
at this rate it must be an inverted doughnut by now
you 're making larsu very happy right now
you sure you got rights to the file you 're trying to write ?
any ideas [ 08:24 ] < soee > i would like to get this fixed : libstreamanalyzer0 : depends :
fyi , all the testbench tests are new , they were n't used in 7.4.4
during this live session boot , have you made any attempt to mount or otherwise access the disk so far
lol
`` by chance '' .. it 's what brought me into this ubuntu business in the first place : )
by reading your pastebin
yes
then it all likelihood you 're on system-image 2.5.1 hopefully
maybe udf does n't create it properly
nice , i 'll take a look into using that
ah , i see run from the usbpen direct to test
committed
that does sound like the driver is n't being loaded at all , and no alternative either . does the
this does tie into the discussion from last night , that if we 're removing a package from wily we
really ? is n't it rolling ?
right . for vertical position , the default value of y=0 works fine
and it should n't fix the issue
ack .
: ( ( (
no tie .
does it kome back ?
( so it 's not even that i do n't trust you -- i do n't trust myself , or
from what i 've read , 12.04 used unity for the login credentials , and 14.04 uses something else .
might not be related , but i have seen similar anomalities with an other project where the builder simple did
good morning
oh , there was a secondary problem too
only update from the fresh install on saturday
i wonder if your changing of the time out caused this , grub should not be showing anyway .
yup . good luck . writing that charm did not improve my opinion of java much , so i doubt
make a script to do it and time the script execution
yeah
which tests ? : )
proxyupdater.new starts the worker with first set to true . setup calls onchange and then sets first to false
no . how do i do that ?
what distro are you running on the pi
state.addcharm does n't use a txn ... and probably should . that looks like a bug to me .
yeah and i watch the webcams from the users from my home roflol
if there is consensus on that ( ie . nobody objects ) then i 'd be fine with disabling both
but it does n't sound like it 's ubuntu-related . sounds more like a hardware ( motherboard ) problem to
besides , the download link is 404
and i am going to fix the bug that prevents the packages being empty like they should have been ,
okay
okay . one moment
i can do that , but i 'd need some reviews to complete the unity landing , so waiting for
it does indeed
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
it is still a development release .
still wo n't fix the container story
i see my text only half displayed and consequently makes no sense
you also know the reason ?
okay , two thoughts from here : ( a ) perhaps that 'java ' command is n't in the path
so likely a different fatwrite then
causing us to release the dead addresses
do you have an ubuntu support question
ok that 's what i thought , i 'll do that
that 's even more dirty laundry ... .we have that `` stable-phone-overlay '' that we use on the rc-proposed images
start : job is already running : pulseaudio
i can do it as the package is treated by default as an universe package i suppose , it will
sudan means prince , king or ruler right ?
oh ! i just remembered , there 's a much better way than getting them through launchpad
which kernel ? those atheros devices are n't well supported yet , so you likely need a newer mainline kernel
yes
i dont think it is the problem with wireless hardware 'coz wifi works fine on windows 7 . i am
excellent . always good to have concensus from launchpad people .
can you file a bug pls ?
am i asking the question incorrectly ?
i got into this problem while install dev stack ... after that everthing i am tring to install show this
hmm , ok , there are constraints , yep : d
if so think i 'll enter the h/w business . : )
sorry for the delay
you got the evo or the pro
that looks like grafix distortion
ok , that worked
how are you trying to execute it and what is the output ?
would you mind filing a bug ?
you still can : )
cause it 's ...
by all means , feel free to do the updates for nm , but some may be quite involved :
mmm not for a storage only drive , no harm in booting back in and running chkdsk on it though
get some book about morals maybe i can recommend one
no . you should probably read and fully understand modes and masks
it does n't ? it jumps to a sheet for me : /
the keeper list is empty .
i 'll add them as mini projects to me todo list since all the kernel build documentation conspicuously refers to
i 've been considering doing this for at least three years but held back since i can not do it
i had to add a step to pre-render /e/n/i just before the container starts though
actually , perhaps just grabbing oxygen-molecule is enough
man rsync for details
there might be platform power-saving functionality that turns off all power to the bt device , under control of acpi
and that was when dave kokandy marked it fix released on glibc
then do n't use it if that 's how you feel
yes , the ubuntu phone image builds are not server images
i had a version from the xorg-edgers ppa already , and it worked fine .
should that be enabled in the upstream cmakelists.txt ?
ok , got it
is that enough though ? : p
yes , but he wants to remove the whole unity desktop , so that 's a bonus .
ok
try the # # windows guys perhaps ?
i dont run unity si i cant walk you threw that but simopply display settings
nothing is good . now `` sudo apt-get install -f ''
the package is desktop preferences
np
the current staging does not contain teh whole api yet , i.e . select and drag modes are not there
it 's not core
then it must not use this version number , which is reserved for srus
in an ideal world where all packages behave , the livefs build process should just be `` apt-get install ubuntu-minimal
nice try : ) but no . the unity/mir should not crash after a failing ap test ... ap tests
yeah create another user account , reboot ( not log out ) and try it out , see if it
no worries , it 's just a ppa like any other , but it has special privileges .
i 'd say that 's the wrong direction
from my side it 's enough , yes . currently mostly focussed on final pre-vacation tasks
well do n't sniff mine
( i still think it 's a bug for anything to depend on the virtuals anyway , but some stuff
what 's the gui called ?
does the additional drivers suggest a driver for that card ; what version of ubuntu are you on
resizing an active partition can be a problem . do you have a live ubuntu disk to boot in order
i 'm happy to do the change in the review tools this time so that they are on good footing
log into to the host.. lxc create -t ubuntu-cloud -n juju-trusty-lxc-template and pass additional options to the ubuntu-cloud template per
the problem is the path
to me it looks like an icon with a menu
and received a couple of sms 's from it
seb128 did it
the proprietary driver *never* worked for me
nobody says it 's not being deleted
try holding shift and see if you get grub
i am truly clueless , so cd \var\log
right that was my first thought
where are you trying to get that approved then ?
great
sorry , i dont consider the mouse cursor color being a problem : d
you mean installing same ubuntu fast on different boxes ?
looks like -qxl does n't follow the same packaging as rest , so there 's some tarball diff
yes . that 's a snapshot . if you want an optimized image you 'd need a file-system-aware tool
< 3
we got an # kubuntu-offtopic ; )
we still use them since we have to use them , they 're always based on the latest ubuntu series
start what as a non-root user ?
did you try starting it from a terminal ? did you get any output ?
that 's my new definition of `` work '' : )
android devices work great with linux though , mtp works , tethering works , etc
idts
join # ubuntu-touch for more info on that
i 'll change the entry in the menu column from yes to no
it just means it was n't mounted .
no - it just shows up on dailies
the system is configured so that you will only need root for special occasions
if you have / and /home partitions then a daily image will take about 30mins to install if you just
i did n't look at any already skipped ones .
ok , just checking it was actually there . is lc_messages set the same as lang ?
the only threaded thing is an executor pool that gets consolidated
oh really ? ok
i just wonder why cron does n't log the job itself
alternatives obviously do n't work with the `` unpack into temp dir '' approach , but the -im6 ones should
through the seed package
well vivid needs qa , but qa approved it so i 'm trying to publish now and everything 's crazy
under iface
i know
the former ; p
how did he try to `` hack '' you ?
ah hm , cos we do n't have a dependencies.tsv there ? : /
sort of . it 's a bit of a long-winded discussion , perhaps best saved for the ho : )
i have been working now about a year on getting the next version of that tablet made , i want
fine with me .
that is
well , yea , duh
so we 'd be back at square one . i realized that you and t-nelson did n't coordinate and i
ah
if you can mount /etc somehow , you can copy it somehow
yes , but i tried another one , and it was the same
if i make a fresh install there is no way to get this files until i get net access
grub does not determine the root device from fstab at boot it is passed as a parameter from grub.cfg
hjjg : it 's actually sudo apt-get install task
no you ca n't
sweet ! what can i help with
yeah , but to get them to run script -f we 'll have them wget the script
put it on trello
comment out existing
we have some tests that actually expect that error ( not for machine address but contention tests )
you still do n't get it , do n't you ?
yeah , i 've tried messing with a few but i could n't find anything that helped .
so if someone wants this option enabled the only way to `` get out of '' that state is indeed
tx
x86 is just the intel original architecture , it can be 16bit or 32bit or 64bit nowadays
that might be a proprietary option . i do n't really know . but typical unix compression software does n't
is it a problem to have an addresser around otherwise ?
you 're too new .
might i suggest something ?
well , you then leave for some minutes , so it 's cheating : )
just a couple days ago
a lot of the 15.04 applications are still kde 4
sounds good to me : )
k
only the things that are made during install . not the things that are made from the program on first
i 'm still looking at it on and off , but i have several other urgent things to do too
upgrade is long overdue . support for 11.10 ended 2 years and 2 months ago .
there are like 35 clients on the networks
whatever you are running inside the vm , your vm does not see anything else but that virtual disk file
anyway it will work out of teh box in plasma 5.5
^
xsel is for the selection clipboard , if you highlight something and type xsel in a terminal it 'll show
with only 1-5 tabs
might just fix it
it 's just that it 's happening in the same process , which is out of the ordinary , and
the web browser opens a local socket on an ephemeral port number ( a 'random ' port ) and makes
do you use bzr 'shared repositories ' when you do your committing work ?
looks ugly
do you have the bootinfo summary saved ?
as well /var/log/apt/history* to see what packages you 've recently modified
me ? what i meant is , is the setting created in xubuntu , or how can i change it
still got a couple of trivial mps to qtmir up in the mean time
replied to jdstrand 's mail in reply to your announcement
oops , grr , typo . `` -n 1:0m:2m -n 2 : +0 : +4096m ''
we 'd find that out if you gave me the output of the command i asked you to run in
trying to record a video
yes
do you know how the new numbers are made up there - just pick one for ordering ?
that 's the question i was about to ask
both tested without flight mode
so maybe try # snappy ? they know far more about this than just me and ogra_ : )
cool : d
i have not tested with speedtest.net but it feels fast in windows . the response is instant in windows but
now that needs an ubuntu desktop i guess
noted
okay - it looks like i 'll need at least 2 pr 's to convert to gopkg.in anyway
i did long time ago : ' (
and yes , no boot
how to do this ?
no , you can upgrade directly from lts to lts
i understand , and i see by my self that i need more knowledge about this anyway . `` give
yes
i only have the / partition
because i do n't have access to my linux box right now .
type cat /etc/apt/sources.list and check if it 's using vivid sources
i dont think so , let me try a different package
oh . should i just ignore that then ?
type uname -r
the 3 others are ook
14.04 is lts , not 15.04
i have changed this line : set ( glfw_client_library `` glesv2 '' cache string
right . that 's what we agreed on now , but that 's not what i have implemented yet
before i cleaned up update-grub , we got uuid cruft in there
correct.. on lts we are busted either way ... because we can not replace the toolchain there
to be honest i 'm not all that familiar with uefi , and am googling my way through this .
looks like those plugins are part of the main digikam.install package
`` grub_terminal=console '' in /etc/default/grub , followed by `` update-grub '' , or make sure /boot/grub/grub.cfg has `` terminal_input console
i 'm pointing you to ogra then ; - )
yep
aye , 2 fixse , one being flake8 the other something else unrelated
yes please
yeah , so , all i could find it 's very old articles . it 's not in repos ,
i know
what about it ?
if i can get that working that 'd be op
mate can be lts or non-lts also
the templates approach is really nice
ok , then the server is physically located somewhere else ?
cheers
do you get a black screen and a pointer ?
like i said , i made an identical edit and the syntax was fine . line 109 for him was
that was likely wubi . wubi is something that should just die .
so if your setup commands depend on having -proposed , you need apt-pocket and -u before ; if enabling dist-upgrade

hi : ) i have an old mac pro 1.1 is it possible to install ubuntu on ?
but.. epoch
ah ok
quite possibly
i just made a stab at the screen thing.. ofc , one is set to visible , the other not
how long are we talking ?
yeah , which is why i asked if you uploaded to the archive , so we can see what issues
ah , well , then this will apply to the trusty charm
cfdisk claims : warning ! ! unsupported gpt ( guid partition table ) detected . use gnu parted .
uuuh ... implementing a `` phone home '' service to check if the network is up ?
need the pastebin url it gave you
then install virtualbox and create a vm .
ok i 'll mark as such : - )
are you using ubuntu ?
yes
just run windows update and get it all up to date - same with ubuntu , make sure you 're
maybe try nvidia-current
good luck : - )
is it better practice to consume the first event within watchleadershipsettings , or within the caller of that ?
i see your point about ingestion that is fine . i can wait .
lol thats a sarcastic cookie
hi ; i guess you should have the right fu for that , would n't you ? ^^
i. e. is it generally okay to push such followup merges myself , or better to do a four-eyes principle
well , i will start from the beginning , i have a freenas system with dying hard drives , i

also make sure the filesystem is intact
wow i had no idea ! so they are brick and mortar or stone stores ?
you 're using lubuntu ?
so seems you can also produce 1k+ lines mr ; )
service it using your dhcp server .
i understand . and i said , thats a good start . but , there are tests that do more
with openlp releases , we make each release a list , and then we put stories into each list when
actually , how do we handle the `` never logged in '' case now in a new 1.26 install ?
the pull will undo it locally once you find the right revision id , and then `` bzr push --
okay i see a lot of installed apps just in the sidebar , when did this start happening ?
i 'm trying to build this rev 92 ( which contains your patch ) and check
the unit is now in an error state
give me a minute to run it and we 'll see .
e : unable to locate package libc-dev e : unable to locate package ubuntu-sdk-libs e : unable to locate package
i tweeted
can you tell me what you are trying to do , overall
yeah , good call .
ah ok - thats good to know . a few of my vms wont live that long and are replaced
nothing in syslog , the ui freezes and then the thing reboots
are you adding some magic hook to the train ?
sonic the hedgehog 's companion ?
it 's part of livecd-rootfs , so any core dev should be able to update that if needed
from the mgo docs : `` bools are converted to numeric types as 1 or 0 - numeric types are
yes , as normally i can conenct any site .
i thought about ordering resolvconf.service before systemd-udev-trigger.service , but it seemed unnecessary serialization
like i 've said , use iptables then
what target branch would it use , that 's how jenkins finds mps .
maybe try another usb port ? set bios back to defaults
volume bar appears to not be white anymore but a blue - should i be expecting that : )
ok , np
it is an strange story , as it has a beamer attached
well at any rate it 's good that you are silently agreeing with me . > : d
few minutes i guess , not long
what do you have in /etc/network/interfaces.d ?
yes , i would say so .
/dev/something is n't the hard drive , it 's /dev/mapper/something_volume01
skype installed
no , i can try .
it still fails : /
paste it somewhere .
ah , so a problem with layouts
yeah the core of this code grew out of a prototype so some code barriers are a little loose
curious , what 's your desktop gpu
who us , uk centric never : )
happy reading : )
do you know how to solve ?
wait , you installed java to /usr/bin/ ?
as in `` sudo -i '' then `` mkdir /target & & mount /dev/mapper/ubuntu -- vg-root /target '' then ``
yes
right , sorry , yeah , autopilot run -vv foo
i guess you are using normal ubuntu ( with unity ) , there 1gb ram is not that much ,
it would be a silent movie
that is cool
as bodhi_zazen says , you 'd probably be more comfortable booting a live iso image since you can run those
`` for n in proc sys dev dev/pts run ; do sudo mount -- bind / $ n /target/ $
so you could n't make a framework that depended on the `` pthon '' `` framework '' `` ''
it 's in the tech section : )
how do i print the content of a qstring in gdb ?
and indeed what the overlat does , is to just flip it from off to on
great , would you have time to review the unity sru in unapproved ?
anything is possible . the likelyhood is very , very low .
hey this thing works now !
or bootstrap-configure / make
no problem . i 'm busy enough that i 'd rather it took time anyway
i also think it something with the ethernet port . is it possible that is happening because the the server
it 's dinner time here . i 'm going to take a break , but will try to check back
i understand ... open terminal ansd type route -n
did you google the issue ? the first link says it 's a case of incorrect grub files , so
kenvandine : sorry i did n't see your ping earlier , but looks like it was just as well
what is `` really stable '' in that respect ? it 's pretty stable now , but will continue getting
except you like pain
yeah so i change the /etc/netwok/interfaces file with the new one ? and overwrite everything and then i do grub
same
or is my hardware borked ?
the write less characters thing is only for play : -p
ok , so it 's the other way round , ~/bin is specified in your path env variable and has
we 'll eventually respin this kernel again ( probably today ) , and i 'll eventually ask in the bug
much strange , 14.10 runs smooth and 15.04 runs lag and touch delay
sure , but nowhere in snappy do we call out to fw_
so in the case of error we ca n't check that
hope you find your answer , if not re-ask here later
no : d
apt-get -f install was working without reporting issues , after i pressed ' ! ' in aptitude `` b
no such file or directory
yes reboot
tried it from another host where i had never used git before and it works there as well
ok : ) i finally got sms that no washing machine for me today , only on monday evening
what is the trash-0 ?
i 'd like to look at some logs to figure out why
b/c of field ordering
damn it 's a dual silo , i did n't want that , sorry
cd into that folder , then try running make
playing with it now
if the ubuntu user would have a standard password i could login directly on the console
aah - ok
could you plz join # debian-qt-kde on oftc ?
it is a amd athlon 3400+ will go check out the rest in a moment
a smart host is another thing ...
no worries , my boyfriend is n't jealous : p
also , it 's not obvious why prepare is called twice ( once before assigning uuid , once after )
its taken a lower priority lately .
but now that debian 's supposedly planning their own version , perhaps it 's too late to be good citizens
type sudo cfdisk /dev/sdc
whats the actual problem
yep .
sorry ?
i have that driver on two machines , one is a desktop with geforce 9600 gt card , the other
is half a person going to be eligible for ubuntu membership in the future though , that seems a little
whats `` the g state '' ?
coreycb , will we automagically get the fix to bug # 1388077 when we next do a juno pkg update
i know that . i m ubuntu user only , but after calibre not worked in xubuntu , i tried
your path seems buggy then
do i delete the .so file ?
^
really odd . yeah the network is setup , it 's that the image is out of date and needs
right , likely
that was after i upgraded the bios
that 's the packaging project .
dpkg -l | grep nvidia | pastebinit
and trading that against bugs ( 2 since yesterday ; ) )
why do you think is a `` local caching issue '' ?
tty2 does n't work
it 's a desktop right now , though it is used headless sometimes
it might be a bit behind ; but indeed i do n't believe it 's looking at -proposed at all
i know ...
pre req has to land
it only fixes it until you release your finger : )
look in software and updates 2nd tab
i just managed to sneak another review in
yeah i did n't think it was that landing , but you never know
from ux pov it 's not `` the provider '' it 's juju 's fault : )
right , so there 's volumeconfig step to attach the volume , and then there 's a juju deploy step
well , that 's a different matter
but yeah , perhaps a bit dangerous for the average end user .
in which case would become `` contains these plugins from ... ''
unless you need mysql for a specific reason i suggest looking at postgres instead , i like it more..
it drops to the recovery console after
this is a different bootloader . : (
hmm , so that also means we dont know yet if the fix works ?
no , use gparted , sudo apt-get install gparted
how old is this laptop ?
how much hdd space do you have to install ubuntu to
sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ( `` root '' ) ( also see !
to go from 14.04 to 15.04 , you have to first go through 14.10 , and given that that eol
standard way : ssh root @ [ ip ]
hmm , i thought i did show you that
if not , do : sudo dpkg-reconfigure maas-cluster-controller and make sure it is pointing to the correct ip address (
is it a usb disk , or something like a phone
you should fix that..also , why two marcelino/marcelino folders
you 'd find it better to use livemedia though
i have nothing inside that file
oh , not that one
it was all working fine until ubuntu decided to restart itself .
so the irq thing was forcing it to go in lower power modes ?
sure
weird , i see nothing out of the ordniary : (
trying to make a machine that loves it enoug to exercise that code . as a side note , regression
hmmm i thought i fixed that
i do n't think there 's any justification for creating an environ in an agent
sure - feel free to merge it !
see `` man bash '' and the section on arrays
/msg *status restart should do it
no , exactly the same
while i sort out that right tmpdir getting created , you should be able to create it yourself from outside
you should get an error in that case
*blink*
happy whirling
to run new bashrc profiles and what not with out login and log out
ahh , i see ... starting up the usb creator in 14.10 the slider is at the bottom , though
so curious if you can upgrade the python-jujuclient package on your system at all
: i am using ubu 14.10
sudo find /etc -iname 'wine* '
what are you trying to get working exactly ?
ack np
likely something in vb . virtual graphics is allways tricky .
/var/log $ ls -altr /var/log/ | pastebinit
i asked you a couple questions that i 'm waiting for an answer on
so i 'll talk to ted and leo about it
netrunner is not ubuntu
example ... you press the power button to turn the screen on , you are in greeter trying to enter
that does not shut off swap , that link tells you this i believe , from the command line or
it is disabled by default , because it tends to not work properly in many cases
do you need calls also ?
mostly
sure : - )
it should be fine : )
?
ah i see .
sudo service lightdm stop , sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm , sudo dpkg-reconfigure unity-greeter , sudo service lightdm start .
cheers - i 'll join # clever-mir and switch to the other channel if no-one answers : )
which library ?
do you have logginglevel=2 in ~/.config/signond.conf ?
just read it . whats the difference in easy terms ?
hmm , possibly hung by that point . something seriously wrong there
istm that adding constants is a fix for old code that justifies a separate pr
yeah , dns-name is a damn lie in status
fair enough
not tonight , but send me a mail about it and i should be able to tomorrow
i 'm writing up a doc as i go along . i 'll post the doc to the mailing list
sure
i 'm off too , but will read up when i return
i 'm not canonical.. : )
google is your friend ... if you what to just hide the content base64 encode/decode could be ok
open the dash and type startup and add the programs there

just trying to encourage a healty attitude to it being the evening while blowing my own trumpet .
what port are you trying to connect on ?
thx
next problem : man : ca n't resolve /usr/local/share/man/man1/youtube-dl.1 : no such file or directory

yeah , you can pm the bot too - helps reduce the spam for us ; )
suggestions : guarantee or guarantee
kris is supposed to be !
those packages are already installed .
xubuntu should be very fast on ssd
i too think it 's just this one , but it raises a bit of suspicion
if that does n't help , poke me again and i 'll try explaining it further
i 'd be surprised if it somehow would break tho
yes , it 's a tradeoff
uh no , that 's news to me
unless the rabbit is running ubuntu , that question is off topic .
well ?
np , you know about the ocr schedule , right ?
why dont you just data recover it with photorec , and delete and re-use it ?
yea.. like 2+ feet the other night ... but boston cleared it out pretty quick.. supposed to get more soon
no , i mean it should be commented
i know it works , as i broke my nvidia install by creating one with wrong configs in it once
yeah that 's not a question
if you do that , it 's fairly obvious why it output what it did
allright - i 'll be off on another work station so ping me if you need me for anything .
yeah , would probably be a worthwhile effort
yes
well sdl2 is still mir umm 0.12.5
ok , that 's more like it , we now know which mail program is being used
ok , sorry for the noise
i can try , give me a bit of time .
i dont think so
davmor2 i use keys for my major servers , but this a little beastie i 'm not worried about loosing
sounds about right . will take a look
and the ubuntu iso isnt the xubuntu iso .
at least until i can get the help i need
okay i 'll get to editing it . you will be available to review in an hour i suppose ?
: )
yes my upgrade from 14.10 was successful
sure , i will show the new plugins and such as well
how to back-up ?
lol , no worries
pretty cool
what 's the tag- '' threshold '' ?
you remember the link ?
you coming down ?
that 's basic web server organisation .
sudo apt-get install exfat-utils
well , that 's it then . i 'll start training the carrier pigeons .
ok
before you do that
example : /msg chanserv topic # ubuntu-za new topix
that was like a premeditated offense
3rd party ppas are way different than the official enablement stack , yes
shall i just get rid of it ?
looks nice ... gedit works ?
is there a bug we could reference ?
wily landing might be blocked by the gcc-5 transition
current topic
ty for responding : ) and happy friday to you !
so what is the problem now ?
no
erm possibly , ca n't remember . there were a couple of people doing things related to that . why
what end ? ?
ok i have crufty radeon machine too .
chrome : //serviceworker-internals should work ( although you need at least oxide 1.7 , i believe )
idman in windows and flerget can do it
yes , i 'm looking at a guide that is telling me the same thing , with his example file
that 's offtopic for here
ya . what i am saying is : there should be such a link ; - )
happy2help !
it might go to sleep if theres no activity
take a last backup , reinstall 14.04.3 cleanly .
ha ! i know right ? my old laptop was the same : s
did it reinstall the rest ?
if it 's already installed add -- reinstall
it 's gnome 2
fyi : i updated the bug with the details that older versions should probably be nulled out like bitcoin was
this meeting is an opportunity for the kubuntu council and community council to catch up
mgz : sinzui switched to go 1.4 and said it worked
to restart scopes , you can run `` restart unity8-dash ''
log in onn the live session on my desktop
no , i 'll look into it today because it bugs me now too
so use that recovery image for what ?
i 'll ask them . tks
right , it 's running the setup for you . give me a second to set it up in wily
monday ? ? ? uhh.. is anybody around who could help ? i wish to test the uitk release candidate
try now ?
oh maybe i should have done grep with a -thing for subdirectories . nevermind that part .
woot !
bashing-om yes , i check every command with my laptop , for some reason he does not get an ipv4
i suspect that issue might be in a different place
it 's normal it fails to build on those two arches btw .
dbus-property-service uses gdbus with a empty-string-array
... okay , i was using the sdk ppa for utopic on vivid
i 'm deploying with logging in a short moment , a bit anxious about discovering what 's up : )
no . could be many things . just asking for another point of data . a headset will tell you
subordinates wo n't appear unless there 's a relation to their principal

can you recall which ones from the top of your head ?
it 's got all kinds of config files and stuff : d
when i reconfigure a silo from the spreadsheet , i 'm left at a white page since the upgrade ,
thx for a suggestion , i will try this out ! : )
just searching
eric^^ : any suggestions ?
sure
how does adt-run break ?
what you mean ?
what happend ?
proxy creation needs to talk to the service
what oscure location ?
well once again you come to us with problems but no logs , output - or anything whatsoever to go
( linux drivers are coming , so they say0
( and ) are included in the command ?
yeah , it 's all the prediction stuff for each language
, is gnome-shell or rhythmbox cpu usage high ?
joyeux vendredi aussi !
i can make a bug for the .5 sec lag so we get it tracked , and add a video
unfortunately that doesnt help
few ideas , first up `` sudo rm /var/crash/* `` then reboot - see if that clears it
yap got it ... quite surprising ...
i 'm probably going to set up openstack
more just `` here are some app changes ... '' brasero , empathy , g cal
cs go is good : )
it 's too complicated for me .
you can ask in # launchpad
let me check that real quick
try bashing-om 's command
silo will refuse to accept that i guess
guten tag
i know ! ! just kidding
and it has nothing to do with ubuntu : )
i wonder if some of the grief that you 're seeing is due to the upgrade process , maybe a
did you install the 32 bit or the 64 bit version .
ok , did n't really know the status , as is jim the one handling this
is n't multi media needed by the kernel ?
weirdly , the icon has n't changed
i see some debugf in the change ?
lgtm , bottom approved .
sure . it 's just a matter of priorities . if this had a high-enough priority some one would look
i did have a way of registering common providers but removed it due to import loops
so we need the archive to have the exact same state as the last image - the content-hub upload was
that should n't be the cause of the freeze though
^
ok , well you should probably do that . and set juju_cookiefile= $ juju_home/cookies
this channel is a lol free zone ... .
wifi or cable ?
the latest kernel is the first boot option in grub
so i took the next one and stayed the night on amsterdam airport : /
`` unicodedecodeerror : 'utf-8 ' codec ca n't decode byte 0xe9 `` is not a permission error .
if the prefix was deterministic from version and snap name , that would be enough for all the c software
this is going to get interesting ... prepare for a learning curve : )
let me rephrase
tweak your fstab , swappiness
cihelp : nothing should build against vivid ( which already had qt 5.3.2 instead of 5.3.0 before ) , should
yes , but the debian directory i ( presume ) is something you just created , and this is the
i guess you could add ~/bin to your path and just dump a vim into /home/ubuntu/bin for the moment
just tried connecting to chat.freenode.net , and it does n't seem to work either
.
what exactly are you looking for ?
yes , database being backed up
both seem to have .
i 'll have testing done by tomorrow , for sure
sudo dpkg -- configure -a
feh ! those appeared in 0.33
you should be able to safely blast it away , it should be recreated by anything that expects to use
i pushed updates to theorigins mp ; the security.md was just a bad merge
i am and old farte
everything needs to land together because of the magic version number of unity-api which we bump , and both unity8
*blink*
32 or 64 bit ?
nope
you know the half discussion i started about getting a poll of sorts on the slide
do you actually plan to do development on the bq ?
i wonder whether it 's clear to actually use the install hook for this . remove the install symlink ,
congrats man : ) have fun
no but , i just merged the last bit of restore : )
hmmm , that might also depend on the hardware wiring . i have no idea if microphone and speaker are
though , while it 's interestingly educational , it might be a slight waste of time having two people do
generally , ubuntu users install software from the official repositories using the package manager
just fyi - it built fine yesterday
sounds good
didnt help - i imported via firefox settings - worked

pdfs can have images embedded using this format . images which are files on their own , like photos from
you mean programatically ?
but usually , the window manager will have a section for changing the mouse theme
yep it 's charging on a wall charger now , i 'll let it charge for a few hours so
let us know how it goes
right , let 's release this and copy to tools-proposed then
latest system bios on ?
my quick and dirty design 2 cents is : do what the camera app and gallery does
then remove the packages with `` sudo apt-get remove linux-image- ... ''
for the raspi2 , upstream is the kernel provided by raspberry.org
is your card an optimus card ?
what graphics card are you using ?
softwarecenter/backend/spawn_helper.py : cmd.append ( `` -- no-relogin '' )
if you run `` mount -o remount , rw / '' and then `` echo $ ? '' right after
i use ubuntu
do you have another hdd to transfer the data to ?
ok , come back on a fresh boot to live session please
easiest way is : see what your router supports for dyndns and make an account there
great , that one man page is nice
i am deploying openstack-dashboard to lxc containers in my env
it is .
daftykins has helped me before , i was joking : - ) sorry tho
but if i change the package not to localise the `` yes '' will it require fixing the langpacks too
at least 3rd ( i was there the last two years and you were there )
any chance i can run a command to update the dbs ? the setting seems to get stored soemwhere at
what device ?
i was hoping i wouldnt have to set up a maas server since that adds something extra ontop of everything
and then something could , say , fetch the config into a .jenv file to run ?
try upgrading libreoffice ?
yeah , shelling out works great
thats what i was thinking ...
a core dev updated libertine underneath this landing .
can you show another `` cat /proc/cmdline '' to confirm it was applied ?
could n't you unblacklist it ?
or ipmi is not autodetected ?
alright -- the `` apiaddresses '' line seems to be what 's off in all the config files . how
it 's like the longest path in history
alternatively , use windows to live resize the thing , if you 're on win7 or later
the folks in # snappy might have a good idea for something
are the set in environments.yaml ?
derp.. sorry postgresql.org
ok , well i 'm trying to figure out what is `` not implemented ''
this state testing refactoring is going really well btw
samsung 850 pro 256
please have a read of it first

chaining back using parent or adding extra properties ?
?
k3b 2.0.80
i 'm in the middle of something now but will re-review
is there a reason for not iterating over options and setting each option description to i18n.g of the description after
but if 14.04 and 14.10 runned steam flawless , i would suspect and upgrade issue
its failing during the package install though so i ca n't get to the config
ubuntu might think you still have 2 active screens
i figured that was the issue . glad i could help .
did you run `` sudo sensors-detect '' first ?
definitely , i enjoy it . looking forward the numbers ( of users , throughput , etc ) when it
how can i update it ? should i remove it and upload it again ?
to get a more trusted and secure ubuntu-style distro , give a try to debian system with mate
lmao why do n't any of the comparison sites include mega ?
it took me quite a while to debug this problem
should be easy update , just stop reading merge-proposals field and read sources field instead .
thats still far too less . : )
feel like pastebin'ing your dmesg ?
please do . mir 's needs better support for input methods so it may take time . but definitely please
so , i guess i do n't see the point of unblocking trunk when we have problems with the uniter
i am yet to see `ls ' output for that dir
no you did n't
infinity : so , if i just run dh_auto_test , it works ; if i run `` fakeroot dh_auto_test ''
rvr : it does not happen with other system setting headers ...
in the provisioner case all i can think of is , uh , instance-reaping mode , whatever it 's called
yeah , need a update of mir
the writable part needs a new card on the board , or a bug for sure . please add one
updating
sorry , you said `` desktop '' , and i implied `` vivid/wily ''
my servers are 12.04 and 14.04 . my desktops 14.10 , i will reinstall when it 's out of support
hm , your branches are nor mps ; )
what is the problem ?
looks like nothing is blocked
oh , there 's also new nvidia drivers in the trusty queue . i 'm guessing i need those for
so if we get an error fetching the subnets for a single space obviously we set the error field on
ok , i just chrooted into the thing normally , and it ca n't find ls xd
no
tried any combination : i3 w/compton and without , unity , fluxbox . it is n't related to this
dont think fglrx will help on intel cards ...
14.10 is no longer supported
it works now ?
so , what would cause this ? problem with chkrootkit ?
yes
yes : ) it 's building right now , but it should be real fast
i have local charm store trust/x-charm , will creating symlinks x-charm-green and x-charm-red work ? eg will i be able
i thought i had fixed it but i guess not
lots and lots of errors ( 22796112 ) , back up your drive now .
check out `` man 7 audit.rules ''
but you just tols us , you tryed to install intel drivers ?
is it ?
no i have n't tried yet . found this fix just now : p
i 'll let you know in a bit how it works .
yes i 'm testing only the provider
oh , fair point . his mention that it 's been happening for a while made me not check the
i 'm not aware of that having changed
your connection to your router probably timed out or something , are there a lot of people who use the
well , apparently you are not missing not being in it ? i though you were triaging the ubuntu bugs
type alsamixer and press enter
to fix both issues in that silo and then move to add the rest of the code later
camako : sorry guys i got ta run to the doctor 's , will be back in about 2 hours
i 'd be +1 all of that except for the incomprehensible lack of godocs in the paste ; )
what time does it usually become available from ?
o04r 14.04 > 14.10 > 15 .
it 's not common practice or so i was just thinking , maybe chmod 770 with chown root : webusers
yes , it should `` buy '' the thing
i try to search on the repo of vivid , but nothing too ... and i need backports drivers for
how do i remove this ppa ?
still all white screen
if i just install django , is there a default page like for apache or tomcat etc ?
i do n't think you did much in the way of changes , it needed the build-depends changed and the
no , we 've single trunks for unity8 , qtmir and unity-api , dual landed into wily and vivid/overlay
so sth like docs.xubuntu.org/contributors and then same index as the regular docs
like i said it 's using the open source driver nouveau . is it online right now ?
what happens when you type julia in a terminal ?
ok skipping then
no one needs to . even not in your use case .
is there an easy link for the packaging changes ?
yes , i tried already
i wanted to ask that what might be the reasons of such issues
no idea , but just go and test a single system with the company product first , as otherwise there
why do you assume it to be in the hoime directory ? where did you download it to ?
this is an ubuntu support channel , join # freenode for irc help

you will see when it happens , on what your doing
i ended up landing the status-get and set stuff after review by andrew , but am more than happy to
i have also executable file called /etc/profile.d/tearing.sh
great . if you backed up your gprs file , you can restore it and reboot . if not ,
was that directed at me ? yes there is a seperate boot partiion that is not encrypted set to mount
what does it matter what other isp 's are getting
seriously ? woo ! we should merge that in
once that gets signed off , it should just be a matter of bumping the dependancies.tsv
yeah
and also the block_suspend denied does not seem to have any negative effect
if you want you can join the debian group to help us to make compiz in debian

the graphical 'plymouth ' splash screen ? you can dismiss that by pressing escape as the boot starts , or
he has to reboot every time , like tell you what set root gives , then reboot to get grub
sorry -ljack
coding mentions those targets . including make testfoo ( the automated version of tryfoo ) .
boot from first drive is n't working on kvm i will try it on hardware in a minute so ensure
anyway , you can also set your device in msc mode , if available
popey : i know what happened : )
paste the link to the clean job you ran
perhaps , but maybe they are all asleep : )
ack . that sounds good , and yes we should use what we expect , so folks can see what
yeah i guess shift does n't work with the live cd but does on a intalled grub boot
no worries , that 's a trivial one
if you have a usb , just make a live usb and you should be ok
we might do a 1.22.6
so you are talking about the ip your isp gives you , not the ip of your computer in your
sure , i 'll finish off this branch then take a look
yes , it is on 14.04
seems a bit drastic !
ty much
yep , seeing that
oh ok
is there any way to test 1439566 ?
actually , looking at it , you ca n't do substitution with write_files .
++
for armhf ?
me doing that now
maybe . i 'll ask again if it turns out that 's not what it is .
yep
dunno , it 's a global var
ack - the user is using a 1.21.1 release of juju
want me to publish them ?
yup
how to do this ?
anywhere but here .
no problem , if you need anything else feel free to ask , someone in here will help you
what if we remove python from the snap , but instead replace the interpreter with one of your awesome shell
no it is not , that is not a problem
argh , yeah , keep strong then to not be patient 0 : )
can i d/l and burn a new dvd while booted in live cd mode ?
: - ) hopefully that is the problem then . keeping fingers crossed for ya . : )
what do i really lose being on lts ?
yeah you need a drug habit and an assistant
it 's a tricky one to figure out , i do n't see anything obvious we might have broken .
so that all bug-mail would be sent to that team
you mean thunar . thunar is the default file manager in xubuntu , is n't it ?
it worked here , the only difference is that i did n't use -- withssl
that hangs happen on other archs and debian as well , looks like the current upload was supposed to fix

juju lxc containers are directly network addressable
yep , i 'll include that then
you 'll note i logged in well before you did . ; )
i see why the everything still works
ah ok. hmm , at tty1 can you run `` sudo apt-get -f install '' and report whether it does
aha
where can i find the previous live-build logs ?
ok. then i trust you . please do tell me what i can do to remove one windows entry from

i 'm fairly convinced this ca n't have anything to do with the panic i saw ( a mgo double-close
an altcoin
rvr : davmor2 : kyrofa will have spotty connection today , so ping me instead if anything arises
probably best to create a fresh one or dist-upgrade it
can we now install click packages on desktop ?
is it letting you scp files to it right now ?
no ...
ta , do we need any other eyes on it for testing ?
everything will work just fine .
that 's litterally the simpilist solution
any particular reason you 're still using udd ?
i did n't quite get what i 'm supposed to modify in that command .
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
which diffs/branches exactly ?
for instance the quicklist was explicitly requested to not be next to the panel , but above/below the pressed icon
sure , but if there is no use for it , i would rather not do it ; we need
i 'm seeing a mix there . it used to be they all had boottest regressions now it seems only
so you should be able to set alias in the .bashrc on that server for user developer
not a sim pin . you need the unlock screen pin/pasword
that 'd be a question for the developers , and potentially not a bug
but that if we landed jes now , that could be a large positive . so no negatives , one
a task will do
right
yesssss
but you can call the full path of the script , /home/username/teamspeak/ts3client_runscript.sh , or wherever it is located .
no , actually , there was a problem in the tests last time . that 's true .
i mean your ubuntu
alright , that 'll work
are you on it now ?
how ?
nope , i mis-remembered . it is running as $ user
the acceleration inside the android stack always was kind of broken for mice .. and i believe it was missing
good luck with your app !
so just unity8 looks fine
so what you want , the same as ubuntu unity , or make it default directly ?
same problem with 262 without the tarball
i 'd leave the headers there , some program sneed them to compile
ah right , so the results from the research cards goes into the 'write test ' card
me too
you can use ssh to forward x applications to your desktop .
i feel like i asked this of you before but i forget what you said , but do you have

bug 1469482
ask your real question
is it on master ?
interfaces are just the communciation happening between the two units . same interface , 2 relations - one for each
elfy and i are probably two of the worst people to help push this forward as we are flavor leads
see if that works
nope , it 's incredibly similar ( drop-in )
i may have to use the gnome verson due to my setup
let 's try and see ; - )
clonezilla uses ncurses by default
never read comments on the internet
sure , i can do that
it 's the way the real world gets it into this mode
it is supposed to be wiped after reaching 20m
also , can you do a dmesg |grep ifup i see a pair of segs in there ( with no
the package is xfce4-settings . you can reinstall it using apt .

greeter-wrapper , guest-wrapper , ubuntu.conf , unity-greeter.conf , xserver-command.conf , unity8.conf
nope , that 's not what it did .
can i get away with calling that a bug ?
your card is optimus and needs the right combo with the driver
it would be then called qtpim5-doc/qtpim5-doc-html
it was a bit like playing whack-a-dpkg to keep my ppa current lately ; )
how to install it ?
june 16
ahh , do indeed , but who knows how much use it gets these days
well then it is a diffrent kernel then isnt it ?
no , it does n't fail , but it prints `` \u0001f4a9 ''
mostly , see the whiteboard
i find it a bit disconcerting that no one 's complained until now , since it 's probably been broken
damn .. i tried this command ... sudo dpkg -- purge `dpkg -- get-selections | grep deinstall | cut -f1`
just filtering by network name might be *easier* anyway
i already said , ext4 , `` / '' ( to be the root filesystem )
you have all the answers , do n't you ? < wink >
when i setup ssh on the server , i make a password like `` this_strong_pw '' ?
sorry , i cnp the -- enable statement
not a biggie , just redundant : )
uninformative error codes are uninformative . any idea where they 're documented ?
i 'm not experience user ( just a noobie ) , you means xorg.conf modified every logged ?
fyi - file system availability is not an issue here
there was no `` information '' on the page you looked at , you found a line that included ppa
do you have any kubuntu dvds or stickers you can bring for our booth ?
^
hrm . kay . the ubuntu kernel is known to work on at least some i.mx6 devices , so i
the current mp `` earlier release ''
that 's fine . you can buy perpetual 2013 licenses and still use office 365 for the online services .
you didnt even noticed it , did you ?
just run `` nm-connection-editor '' . you can also get to the same thing from the network manager applet ,
right
there is no such package
phewwww , this is great news !
we wanted to push to the store , but this issue came up in qa
did you move to .nz or something ?
and that 's conflicting
looks ok to me
you use it to blow the dust and shit out of your computer and computer prepherihislajsh
seems like a pretty cool idea to have the shortcut for sure .
yeah
in test driven development absolutely not .
on the autopilot plugin ; i could not find the widget in the run config to insert my widget into

it is optional after the branch veebers landed , no ?
actually i could do something hackish with the stream , and exclude the skus with `` daily '' in the
yep , although my ppa is much older , someone is owing me royalties !
ah but actually those are the defualts
looks good : )
but i do n't understand the reference , thought you might like to know
i was not aware they were using a differen one
this server has like 6 services and 15 users
well , it 's an utter hack , but *shrug*
yes , that will remove most of those old kernels , leaving you the one you are on and one
you asked about it .
now i know how to trick you into fixing all the bugs
on this box .
where did you run the add-apt command last time ?
awesome . is there a way to see what groups that process is a part of ?
that 's the one i 'd like to try , after several years of unity .
i 'll just make it merge that one to trunk
this is about trusty : )
np
actually it should work
like i said 'sudo apt-key adv -- keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com -- recv-keys a12b6139432062d1
yeah on windows , with their shitty app .
# ubuntu+1 maybe , since its not official till 15.04 i believe
i am of course making the assumption that v4 support in deployer == v4 support elsewhere .
if they want a good solution , they should probably _pay_ someone who knows what they 're doing to set
l
yeah , the compile time check is practically worthless as well
welcome
best to ask debianuser in # alsa
that data gives no context
yeah i understand . let me confirm the fix . i just finished flashing vivid . if it does fix
check that they are correct
did you run sudo apt-get purge then install ?
ack
you could try to unplug it for a second , i 'm pretty sure it wo n't turn of
i can also check with the current gdal maintainer if he has any more advice
well , of android : )
k , so close it as invalid ?
well , you should know what you installed , right ? you can look at `` apt-cache policy fglrx ''

ok , that is not my area
ok , cool
hey
id reccomend lower verion try like 340 , we had some issue on the 352 lately
hmm , not across reboots , since we force mtp on at boot time currently
looks like you did branch-livefses ?
yes
that means that i 'm not able too see the wifi device at all
the gk=graphic
but there would be 1000 failing tests that are failing because they 're testing something they do n't actually care
yes , because its a b320i controller - which is quite ancient .
uh ? giant form should fill the screen
it will switch automatically to html5 if you disable flash completely
yes
how do we resolve the dedicated fields with order ? put them first ?
does n't snappy need any particular permission ? can i run it just like that ?
then you are on your own there .
because i have website and i just installed wordpress
it is indeed an ota8 bugfix
so building ubuntu software is n't a topic for this channel ?
in the post editing screen , in the top right , there 's a button called `` screen options ''
did you create the next milestone already ? : -p
i did , read the question : sync ; sync ; sync ; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
to be able to write edit delete etc . to the web files ( local development server ) . looking
ah i see
you have n't ; the i915 driver reports the hdmi interface and the snd-hda-codec-hdmi driver reports the audio interfaces
same source built on wily fails
either roll your own , or do a backported kernel would be my suggestion .
alright , i appreciate your help ! i 'll dive into using go-dbus : )
how are you creating the live usb ?
one with a good screen , one with a pish screen ?
it clearly is a permission issue , the error states : `` permission denied '' . what do you think
do n't you think ?
what 's the oops id ?
would n't the silo make more sense with that fix in ?
it says
but it does n't say 'use that also for desktop version '
it seems to be , but it also seems to be stuck at that line .
ug
state the problem
maybe there is a problem with the ppa
you 're a hero
there is some hard coded x11 in the linux part of the platform
19 oct i believe
i just get that email after a dput . i guess it gets sent to the package signer only .
how to fix it ? sorry newbie here
what is it programmed in ?
i know it
but if you want a non-gui player , pretty sure mplayer would work
no , not at all
?
you could always just write it out with a redirect -- > sudo lshw > myfile.txt < -- - then
with computer wizardry , when you give orders , they are generally followed to the letter

is there an easy way to add a modified ubuntu image ?
he failed the turing test
also with juju bootstrap -- debug -- series=vivid -- upload-tools i got the same result
those stats are somewhat different from the ones in the tracker
the call is `` digits ... ''
( the outbound queue should fill up on the hosts where rsyslog is working obviously )
i kept wondering if you guys just had n't checked in the ec2 provider
regarding the move to git we could follow this course of action : create a git repo , put in
oh i 'm not in the loop on that ...
you basically only need `` display : flex ; '' for the container
that sounds like a network driver issue
cool , i 'll wait : )
what flavour btw ?
most software only gets heavy bug and security patches , which will not bring it to the latest version number
what information ? most you have to specify yourself .
nice one
right , so some device when initialised is upsetting things . are there any usb deviecs attached , or anything
i just reproduced that same problem on vivid-proposed without the silo
okay
why is it not needed anymore ?
so , we have a concept of `` static '' translations , like translated help files or screenshots ; pkgbinarymangler
( meeting , bbl , but i 'm fine with postponing mine )
already made the switch to ubuntu this morning . debian had way too many problems on this machine
good , run 'sudo tcpdump -i any arp ' then try to ping .114 from .115 . do you see
so the docs are not generated in the package , then ?
looking
no worries : - )
we do have support for failing over to another az , so i guess it 's just not checking errors
so you control the web server config ?
how are you doing these commands if you ca n't boot
ok ... who is lt though ?
yes deb only ?
does n't matter , attempting to install one of those drivers is pointless - just being on an up to
its more then normal its expected to happen
as soon as my overcrowded desktop shows up i 'll give a sigh of relief ...
do you need that today ?
they use windows nt on the subs
i 'm actually working on fixing that now . it comes from our request for the body part preview .
you could add `` xset s off '' to your autostart entries
yeah , as it should , but the related method that returns the provider id field value should cast it
ah , ok
its just for testing purposes
i hope not to take too much time , i 'll try to produce some faqs docs in order to

do you have an idea about how to make dual monitors works in ubuntu ?
random commands are not helpful .
question is how do i diagnose what 's going wrrong
so all the provisioning happens on the machine agent
yeah : -/
right , and it looks like you can supply the yaml by just typing it on standard in
do you think swapping that disk out would fix it ?
watch the language
the package 'sysv-rc-conf ' is in the universe component of the archive , so is an optional install , presumably
yeah , understood
just grabbing a sandwich , what should i be looking for ?
unfortunately , no . srt is something entirely different
we ca n't
ok , i know why it worked locally : appdata-validate was not the reason it was failing
fwiw anyone who knows what they 're doing will look at the disk layout and think `` what the hell
what client are u using ?
ok , well good luck . the more decent data you can collect , the better : )
ca n't seem to pull the greeter from right ?
ok

alexisb : np : )
right , that 's what i was saying at the start : )
specifying the machines that juju deploys to in a bundle
iirc the timeout was to localhost ,
: )
and did `` sudo snappy install your-snap.snap ''
err , it needs to be /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d or it wo n't work .
really . hm , okay .

will report back later .

if bin/sh is actually /bin/cat then i reckon there 's a script doing a complex shell replacement parameters operation that
any eta on when the 1.24.3 thing will start testing the upgrade ?
that 's the kernel in the base os , so it will be the same kernel version in the image
ack
not that i know of
are you doing that with quickstart ?
ooh i am curious ... any hints to what it might be ?
incidentally , that is the way you modify the environment variables for any process .
are we trying to view the xorg log with that command ?
yep .
me either
what 's `` silo n '' about ?
both , apparently
i guess so
debian maintainer remove powerpc architecture ...

lets not talk in general here : p
but the range reported as unused/unreserved returns the low value as 172.16.0.3
yeah this would be the right place to update the file ...
so make that data part of the 'midonet-host ' interface type

the bootstrap packages are n't as hard , as we know there is a working primary archive or we would

ok . when it fails , ssh in , and inspect the journal
what was the bug that was being fixed ?
as i said - it 's an old system ; ) and i 've not been on top of uninstalling
you 'd have to define crashproof first
yeah it is possibly just streaming x you can ofcourse just turn the other screens off i guess
there 's a strong dose of `` the physical disks are definitely the machine 's responsibility , and it 's

alright , so do you have access to see the login screen ? you 'd have to log out .
then you do n't have wifi and ethernet ?
ok let 's try

what are you working on ?
yes it will

i need those commands to be host specific , i.e . use the _ { node_name } argument

then you can pip freeze
top shows virt , res and share by default , in htop you can enable those .
ca n't building packages from point releases be automated by the way ?
why are you not running 14.04 for the host ?
well prague never saw it , so i 'd go there
and after i do that if i update it will downgrade ?
yeah , just give me an ping if you need me

how are you setting your nameservers ?
$ { apache_log_dir } /error.log , so probably /var/log/apache2/error.log
lsb_release -a
because i needing to test it on a linux server
might be worth checking if the xorg stack has it in vivid too , before you go to too much
if it was a dual landing then it means that the package is now both in the vivid overlay-ppa and
well , it was in ram , but everything you 've done since you dropped the file has impacted ram
mbruzek : in the mean time is there any thing i can to to help wth those mps ?
technically , there is one ubuntu `` distro '' just different flavors
unless you are from bakersfield amiright ! ! !
and unpromoting *everything* since the event would be the only way to really ensure that , which sounds kinda disruptive
i know , i 've been rather quietly been watching the development of things since ut was announced
good deal .. we presently have a great relationship with amd .. we can hope for a resolution soon .
looks like it installs a whole new desktop session . uses /usr/share/lightdm/sessions/unity8-mir.desktop
did you try the link i gave you ?
oh certainly not suggesting one massive view , just a container with a sensible menu encapsulating all those small views
correct . i understand ... but , at boot , *right* after the bios screens , you should be able
right
dunno myself , is that a vivanco usb access point ?
thats one of them
omission is not really supported , afaik
try this : install 14.04.3 ( lts ) now and upgrade to 16.04 when it comes out .
yes
process of elimination .
happy new year
i believe the idprefixwatcher is a 'base ' type that the action specific code uses ?
i mean , the download is started and then we do timeout , correct ?
is system-image ( ubuntu-core ) not including shim-signed [ amd64 ] on purpose ?
it could i guess yes
ack
there is a key at the top of the output ... .
type uname -a
that is a problem outside of the docs no ?
oh .
ye unlikely , got a touch screen too
i need it for eclipse , not for browsing .
curiosity killed the cat !
this is ubuntu related how ?
nerd ?
lists files if you have unrar
no problem
you reserve it ... ok , now boot normally
i 'm here , was just thinking about making coffee but figured would miss something .
i 'm lost then xd
live disks it just has the usb first in the order and it just boots that in uefi mode ,
as luck would have it my adsl connection died , but the build survived anyway ; cdimage bit is done
gotcha let me try another linux distro
so afaict it 's not restricted
qt android sdk
what happened ?
that confused me : )
like the items in your row at l56 need the same width set
what snap is in the store already ?
why would you want that ?
well your zeegaree app would be nice for a start..still runs nicely on my desktop
trying here , i 'll first double-check that i can still reproduce it and then check with your patch
so i wanted to get your thoughts on what might be the best approach to take in this situation
actually , why no 14.04 screenshots at all ?
we have certain test utilities which are testing the kernel part of bluez
384,000 meters per second = 384 km per second
i 'll report back shortly
as you can see i typed `` catch throw '' , but it seems like there was no exception
we have many users with many use cases , breaking stuff that works for one use case - when we
but did you get this far ?
hehe , exactly
the 1.3 is on all phones since may .. it is available for app developers since then .
bug 1477788
is it crashing on launch for you ? or only on opening the submenu ?
that 's tar 's fault
please pastebin the output of the command `` mount ''
do you see the partner repos listed ?
basially my whole syslog is ignored relative path
thx
cool
well , that 's a different process than just patching it for yourself
thumper : this env is 1.21 . i do n't think the problem has been fixed there .
he 's happy for me to add an empty gccgo-go that depends on gccgo to vivid .
i have n't tested the most recent changes thoroughly yet ( to the unity one )
that 's why i suggested that slot , it was the only one that worked for me : )
took me forever to find a way to build it that did n't die on me
was it thursday night ?
what does super key do ? ( im at work , away from my linux pc )
unless you figure out some other way to do it
android..
i do n't see a retry
but why does n't it say ...
still nothing , as i said it 's strange since even executing the bzr cat commands that the train does
to be fair , i 'm not really convinced of the usefulness of these tests , they are just doing
it was thumper who remembered this , not me .
natefinch : the idea was to get a bless anyway , so skipped the bot . should n't have done
there 'll be configs under /var/lib for some packages too
just the embedded packages , but it is the actual packages , i did n't look at the file attribs
redwolf from the lubuntu team would probably love to help , he is pretty good with that kind of stuff
it 's just a single backing drive .
making all errors be json
powersupply , ram , gpu , mainboard , temperature are just a few reasons possible .
anything you 'd like me to try , let me know .
i have not connection . using vi now blippe : )
elementary is not ubuntu . this is an ubuntu only irc .
hey
when it 's upgraded , i 'll retry it for you in the ppa , without needing a new source
have you checked the usual suspects ... conf file .
dpkg -l | grep nvidia
nice to see a core dev on here , by the way !
`` pastebinit /proc/swaps ''
yes my ultimate goal is to automatically generate grub configs for my zfs roots , even clones from snapshots
nah click the dash icon top left ( on the vertical sidebar of icons ) then type gparted , it
presumably , i ca n't upgrade to 15.10 directly ? i have to upgrade to 15.04 first ?
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
i just used this to illustrate the possibility : )
i 'm way behind the times : p
tnx mate , after we find a house , ill start the shop
i can try to help you too , but on monday and tuesday i will be away for most of
using what
no xubuntu-core
i was running commands like normal
that does n't look right to me
we have to figure out the building stuff ( which i 'm just trying to do with unit193 ) ,
yes lots
what card is it ?
you could have ( or still can if you have n't actually installed yet ) dragged the divider between ubuntu
i believe there is a keepalive at the tcp level . i do n't think the keep alive were are
and for this , would i need an x server or something
all i see is `` booting a command list '' - i 'm going to remove `` quiet '' from
ok
no , that 's okay , i misundertood you earlier
nope .
test if the device has a default route ( create a temporary private subnet ) and see if it can
dconf reset -f /org/compiz
i guess now is not the best time
what do we need that for ?
no , it sounds like an update buggered up something -- wo n't get past the gdm screen
are you sure it 's not just usb cd/dvd drives yours do n't like booting from
can you give me an example ? : )
not helping..
pong
so you see theeternalabyss when you do groups plex ?
done
in short , apparmor is in the upstream kernel , however ubuntu has a ( rather large ) delta that
i just get [ 411021.947943 ] ext4-fs ( sde1 ) : mounted filesystem without journal . opts : ( null
so they did n't make a mess of the os , they just told your boss that they needed more
is this going to be debian again : p
i do n't see there 's a difference between an unversioned import and an import with a v0 version
i was around : )
ahyes !
are you coming to leader-election ?
you 're right about itunes with apple music being a ui/ux-trainwreck
you can open another terminal and type 'pkill -usr1 dd ' to get dd to tell its progress .
looks right to me
^
what release are you running ?
^
the important piece of that line is [ ok ]
yw
has anyone in particular sponsored you in the past ?
the question is , why is this package not installed on your system ? it should be by default
same deal
that was n't part of your code , but i added it
i do n't remember
yes
/var/log/dist-upgrade/20150503-1525
yep , alt+mouse2 to move stuff
well it 's just a phone now . i bought it mainly because of convergence
^
i could maybe cludge something together for lp : ubuntu-cdimage , the debian installer i have n't the slightest idea
do n't you have a user ont eh machine with sudo access ?
mmm no .
afterwards , i tried that yes..
how are you trying to mount it ?
you ca n't patch a func
why
so , lets punt that for an sru ...
0.1 here : (
right , if you just reboot it wo n't get flushed to a permenant file , if it had gone
to become github.com/juju/clock
probably it is some python3 transition problem . i have added a comment asking the hplip developers at hp to
i ran and installed ubuntu on host windows . you goon .
i 'd better test ppc/ppc64el tonight , so i know if the world 's generally broken .
anyway delaying metrics is kind of hard
iirc dobey hacked in support for native packages , but the version-generating feature does n't work as well . definitely
look into virtualbox headless
yes , but we are not releasing an iso . you can still test it though
sure
hello !
ack
ack
yeah ... it 's probably because both graphics cards have an audio card , but the system does n't know
twss
pretty sure hackers do n't break in and then arrange your icons
doing well , i sent you a follow up this morning about your charms and if there was anything required
you 'll have to ask happyaron about how important it would be .
well you might have the most updated drivers , but that doesnt mean their the best
dont enable the root account
why is the upstart job executed twice ?
actions ?
fwereade_ and i met for a moment and then dropped
no , if you 're booted in uefi then it 'll install in uefi
on what ubuntu version , and what ppa ?
i dont know where to check like sys log
what 's wrong with showing all locales that we have translations for ?
this is a nightmare .
if that happens without the gui then focus on that , sounds like the root cause
why is this race condition not affecting 3.19 though ?
yep , vivid we do n't care about currently but wily should build
no i am just trying to find a source to ask my linux related qustions and all ... etc
yeah , successful with silo
that was my point indeed
see for your exact make and model and if some one got the same issue and solved it already
want me to publish it then ?
ok
it 's a different world these days
do we set an error on listspaceresult and do we return an error too ?
can you do screenshot ?
check the slots ... i saw you have a firewire ...
i wonder how noboy noticed or cared before .
at this point we land the meta package change when the gates open , and the chroot change can then
thought it 'd make sense in the same branch , but if you think not , i 'll do
just ./indicator-keyboard-test
but i have virtual mailboxes that defined like that mail_location = maildir : /var/vmail/ % d/ % n/maildir : index=/var/vmail/
does 1600x900 @ 60hz sound correct for your display ?
when i try to do ls -l /bin/ [ it says no such file or directory
is that the future , or an experiment ?
seems there is no wireless driver available , what does `` lspci '' say about your wifi-chip ?
from the command line , using apt-get
dbarth : ok , so silo 16 still makes sense then
trying to understand how ext4 works ... ... .basics
we do n't compete
ok , i see why . if the next boot is good that file is deleted ; if the boot
at least i have a list of top 100 so i can know
do n't know , checking sources , could be a juju-deployer bug
digicam is in the regular universe repos
could i just ask anthony ? : d
some special hardware has issues with the kernel . which gets loaded after grub
it maybe better to wait until balloons or someone is around who could advise the best action here . it
it asks you for a 'passphrase ' to protect your keypair . it 's up to you , if you
2 gigs is not low
awesome ! ! \o/
i am busy between 5:30 and 6:30 . coming before is cutting it close , so can come in after
someone in the community might port it
cant hurt hahaha
you 've extracted out the functionality , but have n't encapsulated it in a way that makes sense
how
the test may have timed out before machine 1 could restart
davmor2 , imo what we need is a way for clients to specify this so that we do n't add
ok what kind of computer and what do you have on there , windows 8.1 ?
sure , but keep stuff migratiing , look at update_excuses
more a technological one
can anybody crack that passphrase by looking at my key file !
the mini iso should work fine , with downloading packages from the internet , or this iso should work fine
anlyses started
there is no bad language allowed
when in doubt over a command , usually there is a manual page for it so try `` man <
ok , sounds like a plan . sorry i could n't help you more .
hmm ... well , i do set a filter on the collectionid i create ... maybe i would get them
yeah i 'm sure , i asked mirv if we could release qtmultimedia 5.4.2 instead of 5.4.1 onto vivid+overlay ...
it 's already in the sponsoring queue
check what it says
and now that we know that we will have to move this change into uitk as well , extra care
heh . well that wont happen !
ltinkl found a small issue in mousepointer for unity-api and qtmir , if you 're still working , could you
that makes sense
yeah i read bt are doing a teeny ipv6 trial today
backports are ok to land with one +1 , fwiw
seb128 : yeah
yes theres the software updater
so anything not for wombat to do ?
that 's weird , do you have it handy ?
this organizer is killing me : d
so would you say it 's the apt-cacher 's problem and # debian the right channel ?
i am being friendly , k1l is attacking me for asking a question .
it is hard to say . there very few tests to define the correct behaviour of cursors . and i
cool
`` noo , meetingology is back '' ?
feel free to pick up the upstream work and get those pull requests updated and merged to qt proper :
probably . if not , it 's easily fixed in post install
it is ? i was n't aware of that at all . here i am , faithfully installing bumblebee on
`` make it so # 1 '' ? : )
-- mir does that for you
my linux only boots when i have uefi enabled in the bios
the error log is empty , the access log says i accesed the website from my browser
zsombi had 129 `` new '' bugs this morning
nothing wrong with that meng , i 'm self-taught , and php led my way to more advanced positions now
i see the menu which lists . 'english ( uk ) , enlglish ( us ) ... ' i maybe
wine
if you do n't have time , do n't worry . we 'll do it as part of that card
sure..will go through it with a fresh mind tomorrow
yeah , but 3h ago
ah , it 's wednesday
kill it regardless
cheers : )
yea they work pretty well together and the setup is n't quite as scary as it looks
frobware : oh , i forgot to mention in standup . i have a meeting at daughter 's school for
will try that env var , way easier than hunting for it
alright , still agree on the reinstall though - you 've totally ruined that install
what was the question ?
ppa-files are not the drivers
are you running 15.04 ?
done
you are accusing me to not contribute to upstream projects ...
bug 1302694 ?
please update the existing device tarball landing
if everything is alright : )
best place to discuss it is # snappy
it 's not just normal quoting unfortunately
so what says `` df -h ''
understood
do you know how to open conky 's config file , do ya ?
let me try to have a look now
excuse my ignorance .
as one pal of my says , `` kevork it ''
yea
indeed
this is what i get : vim : the term 'vim ' is not recognized as the name of a
k , needs to be reconfigured again , the premature build effectively undid the reconfigure .
i 'm fresh out of ideas on it right now
dpkg does not resolve dependencies , that is apt 's job
please do n't speculate . if you are interested , please have a look at the sources
somewhere around there , i believe you can get the script alter it , run it custom
oh ! ... disabled that pile of 0-days ages ago !
hmmm interesting ... . but thats from 2014 ... still no fix ? !
false . vlc is pretty self-sufficient so far as drivers are concerned .
explains why he is n't on any other channel : - )
so wonder what this file actually does
it 's free-form text , see previous changelog entries for style / feel as to how to write them .
republishing then
may as well blame that
he did .
ok , so simply create a new hangout on air
substitute in the latest version you know of
very funny . it 's not being a vps , it 's being amazon ec2 - totally different . sorry
ah , did you typo your pastebin then ? as it reads eth2
wow that brings back the memories of the modem days , huh ? : )
i am moe than aware what nomodeset does , i have no way to enter a command
no , i 'm guessing this regression is only in master . i 've not built master yet , so
maybe thats more a question for the # # networking guys
add -p after mkdir
i5 cpu , 8gb ramm , 1x r9 290x gpu
there is no real benefit to adding ident support . if you have a registered nickname on freenode that is
what are you actually trying to do ?
then launch xscreensaver -- nosplash at boot
but i 'm happy to give you a tutorial any time you have a couple of hours spare
you are saying , you already did , correct ?
use a pastebin for terminal output
what is the output of 'whereis apache2 ' ?
that one 's about squid 2.7 - > squid 3.5 , we do n't have that issue . maybe .
so is that something we can get patched up and landed then ?
`` sudo chroot /target ''
nslookup/dig will answer you where its looking for the hostname : )
and aptoncd can help you there
was it you who advised me to make money on the internet instead of working for free on wikipedia ?
if you are still in the mood , there 's a new one by now : )
`` pastebinit $ { home } /.xsession-errors ''
still no
i can connect the printer using the usb cable
there is no `` but '' .. its designed *not* to work , since its not supported anymore.. you can
not clear which approach will fail more often
it requires an internet connection
those are n't meant to fix your problem , but they do indtsll flash and java plugins etc that help
keep in mind we also will have `` ubuntu desktop '' device targets . that are not the traditional ``
do that .
right so the drive is good , that makes life easier
grub-pc does n't exist on powerpc , that would be a no-op .
i wann launch my application if some button is pressed at boot time
# ubuntu-server i believe
aye , i was just making a funny ! : d
ah , great
mmm try the log
it might be good enough for a hack today , mind you . just saying that it 's not accurate
if you find way , let us know !
ok , that is your /boot
no clue , that 's what it does by default when doing the install from that ncurses interface ( i
compile it manually ?
install it from your packag manager
yeah experimental == ppa in debian world .
probably anectdotal
the problem i have with linux utilities is they all expect me to read the entire 600 page manuscript detailing
`` it is failing '' ... can you please be more specific ?
we can focus on the second issue , which is a regression . finding what commit caused the second regression
the code which did v1 stuff has already been dropped .
the keys are there , gnome-tweak-tool uses them
i agree it is n't optimal
so somehow launchpad ppa got something different than what we uploaded . i 've never heard of that before ;
i have n't used linux for long period of time anyway i am a beginner
and why install server edition on a laptop ?
you mean , pw age policy ?
ask in a perl channel
i am
say hi to sky for me : ) bye .
you know you must register windows to update ?
in an unrelated note , doko poked me about duplicity and python3 . are we making another python3 push for
why are there two partitions on mine ? one so small and one so big ?
may have the same cause , though . stale links after updates etc
we have our own widget
sure , try lightdm
pia are my vpn provider
yeah . i do n't think we care about pack size at the moment , though .
allow me to swiftly ignore then !
well , `` latest '' is slightly difficult to specify -- i have n't rebooted in a while , this
`` fast ''
skype was never there ( according to apt )
hangout ?
yes , ntfs cant do permissions , but the entire partition can be mounted with the same permissions , which
ok , i understand : )
last relevant change ( 225-1ubuntu1 ) was on sept 5
was it already in markdown format ? most of it looked like it was ?
works pointing at ubuntu.com and grabbing the first image from there
as fast as ubuntu , since ubuntu uses thedebian upstream .
41
hmm , i have not tried it yet , and i do not know how it goes .
i 'm afraid i 'm not in on the joke ; - )
so do n't ask for support in the # ubuntu channel
look for zequence
you can have multiple entries for a route where the lowest metric wins
i would n't be surprised if that was possible to hook up , but you can certainly do both things
then you installed xubuntu .
it would be nice to be kept in the loop !
i 'll toss that upload at the archive .
only your first one ; but i 'm waiting for increased logging to be applied on our servers
if i knew the problem i
right , will do
which version do you have ?
check with ethtool if a cable is connected and then set up the connection .
if you 're only adding a unit to the topology , it should be fine to just self.deploy.add_unit ( )
then an still open file was deleted , and the space is regained when the file lock is gone .
about the timeline ?
so adt-run . -- click=../foo.click ?
what sort of site ?
the tests depend on ubuntu-app-launch which needs upstart .
you heard about those dreamboxes satelites ?
you can answer this , friend.. can you git push in the terminal on your workstation ? yes or no
did you try attempting any of the other tasks to improve the tracker ?
also see what elfy said
that mabye the case
once we do decide we are frozen , then any mps will be held until after the translation cycle and
in live session ?
yes , i will be around
not stupid , i good idea . i know vila has mentioned that he has ideas on improving how we
that your launchpad creation date ?
not seen anything myself , ca n't see any reports of it either
you mean code confligt ?
yeah
the file
does that mean people rarely use kerberos/
thnx
you have juju-db jujud-machine-* no ?
okay , that 's what i said . : )
it seems to belong to unity8 , not qtmir , what do you think ?
bad nick for this channel : p
plasma-pa got added , kmix is still around i guess
pitti : copy and paste error .
that should be plenty
just leave it off then
can i customize the name to be sure ?
is there no gui ?
how are you configuring them ?
and tell me what happens
sure , there are installer scripts somewhere in softwarecenter
which versions of testtools does it want ?
fail2ban for ssh users
yeah , i do n't think so
have to go , gl with your issue right
can i see /var/log/gpu-manager.log and /var/log/xorg.0.log ?
oh ok . but i believe i also saw a prompt for a reboot at the command line
i have to do something
you might be able to copy the network config over with `` phablet-network ''
it is , was my fail , i 'm just testing my fix now
he was up on the fridge eating styrofoam packaging that we put up on the fridge to keep away from
cat /etc/*-release
but you 're going to end up having to move up the linux ones - so it 's probably pretty
im gon na start an ubuntu computer shop in my country soon
i read irc guidelines
but everything else scales up too , then you have to play with the second control on the right about
the change is please note that this approach is affected by ( bug:1426132 ) baloo is not replaced by baloo-kf5
what 's the question ?
in this case it 's /dreamy_ptolemy
yeah
only boot from 12.02 live cd at present , it seems .
that 's why i asked here , they do n't theme gtkheaderbar , so that wo n't gain much
and it is a config_* so we can do that
i 'll need a minute to try and get this output to text so i 'm not sending one hundred
ok cool
np , i spent good friday painting and riding , too tired to look at patches now !
( x ) rdp ?
anyway , can i ask you just to provide a small example of qml exporting a music file ? like
same result
i actually like your solution
but for me it 's not important now , i know what kind of mistake i made
i enabled uefi + legacy , and legacy only
i 'm adding it in , but i thought i 'd let you know in case it 's a process
ah , fixed last year so it should be fixed in 1.23
you can install packages with : sudo apt-get install your-package-name
anyway , i fixed permissions there , now it says i miss < qtcore/qstorageinfo > - how can i install
hmm , i guess i 'm set for trusty , so that may be the problem .
okay not that then ... what 're you running ?
you can launch it as another user too . it = command .
there 's logging of the txn counts etc in juju/txn each time maybeprunetransactions is called
dunno , dist-upgrade is no longer used to upgrade to a new os the command in the newer releases is
so i 'll have to put together a simple bundle
do you even silo
what was the command ?
when was the last time you cleaned the cooling system ?
familiar with how that works , when i was loading via fstab without adding the vboxsf in modules it couldnt
there should be no difference in rootfs between those two channels ; per the list discussion , we 've recommended
so , i 'm pretty sure the tarball is just fine , it has the forked xml
i found a file /etc/x11/xinit/xinput.d/maliit on n7 , but not on my tablet , maybe it 's related
right , but it should n't -- it can set its own local field
sure : )
( in our planning meeting now so sort of distracted i 'm afraid , many apologies )
you also have n't stated what your 'goal ' is .
that 's why i held back my silo some time ago
ehh , to do *that* , i 'd have to set up an arm builds ppa to separate it from
i can type , but the save button is not activated until i type an space .
there 's no technical reason they could n't be supported
sure , let me look
i can ssh to the pc , everything is good at cli . i cant do anything when i log
be patient as it might take some time to get to tty1
slitaz - never heard of it .
are your commits all at the top of your branch ?
my machine says utopic and the website is universe , which is utopic
did you md5 test the iso you downloaded ?
yeah , that might require more effort and less chiming in
hi , i got those error while doing an apt-get update
done
seems like a logical course of action though ... want me to do it ?
well , we have seperate channels & images actually for pd
for sure i did ! : - )
yes , that is an easy one usually .
since you are logging as some user which exists on the system
yes , i already verified the coordinates are correct from the object tree . i was just confused about what
ok i have uploaded it , hopefully cyphermox can push the commits , seems odd though to have a restricted
just read the release notes - the link in the note to the wip doc - the doc is out
yes for now
are any click packages having their autopilot tests run under adt-run in jenkins at the moment ?
again , under systemd the rules are different .
reading wikipedia about passive voice : )
yeah
ubuntu not fitting on a cd , thats why
looking !
got fstab and blkid
yep i read that task : )
no i am not on xenial
well , we have a `` de_de '' locale , we ca n't check for /usr/share/locale-langpack/de_de
like i always do
combined at code level , i mean : - )
so free some space
you can install virtualbox right from the ubuntu repos
does a reboot change anything or this behaviour persists ?
another option is to cd to the www directory and run ubuntu-html5-app-launcher
will dist-upgrade upgrade me to non-lts ?
well yes , working fine , but is it a better soln to try and resize /boot ? i thought
do the command oerheks said
you 're adding a word in your head that does not exist
i say `` we '' , since `` we '' are more than just me who told you the same
when you first asked i was going to tell you to dial up your connection ; )
i got a debug journal and did the usual package bisecting first , so pretty much what you did yesterday
no list
worse : `` le maire '' , `` la maire '' , but you would n't really use the latter
do you have an ubuntu support question ?
it worked
but this is juju doing this bit
so , sudo fdisk -l
does that have the difference , yet ?
hey ! i 'm at the event , and tomorrow i 'm gon na present using the online demo of

i can ssh into it
yes
guess i 'll have to give it a go . and deal wathever happens ; )
hmm strange ... the game has 5 reviews all of which are 5 stars , and yet the overall game
do you know why that is flashing ?
tasksel is pretty easy . here is a link to a guide for ubuntu proper to ubuntu gnome using tasksel
but you can start the live system with the bootoption 'nomodeset ' and after system installation add the according nvidia
would n't that only be with apps you buy and download , there 'll probably be a fw syncs like

the problem is intel just have a very very sharp pin on their chip making equipment , and until amds

what packages would you like in this silo ?
i 'd like to move files into a usb . how can i find the usb directory ?
for v2 , signedurl could still work
you got unity8 from demo-stuff ?
ubuntu is not turning on my monitor because i had it turned off in settings while i was using an

then run that command
yeah , i 've a branch
under that directory is one directory per user , and under the user directory 2 other directories . for me
perhaps , currently i do n't run a dns
how you 're connected to that server ? physically , vnc , ssh ?
this is repo supported .
basically anything that can process multiple input events ( well ) per frame
and the consol logs shows that it is pulled , but the build is missing it
ya , i 'm on unlimited bandwidth , 100mbps
withou specifying any uid/gid , the numerical values from the source ( the nfs server ) are in effect .
whoa , you kinda lost me there
well , im just saying , the system is built with the concerns you raise in mind
this source is from 2013 which is why i ask
yeah i know , it 's good enough that i mailed a flash drive to a friend in canada since
a framework can simply expose it via framework-policy
what would you be using it for ?
what is the executable you 're trying to run ?
hey , sorry for the delay , you got a minute ? : d
we would need different behavior of input method ui for touch and non-touch , though
yes that 's fine , it is not a combined context , but proxy is empty for him

bah , armhf fails now too with dependency errors
type `` display=:0 notify-send `` hello '' '' and quickly press ctrl-alt-f7

yup , looks good now
see ubottu 's reply just above
adding murano* to the cloud-archive as well
loool.. tunisia still in africa not in europe : p : d
have you verified reverting that fixes the problem ?
do they work good ? does ubuntu runs good on macbooks ?
that file should be a full init script , touching it wo n't fix anything
will do
do you usually use silos ? i can already put it in one if that 's the case
ubuntu has become so good , nobody needs support anymore : p
when i use a menu , i like that , as well
though nfsv4 can use kerberos to authenticate rpc requests
bootstrap -- debug log should be useful , if not that then /v/l/c-i-output.log and /v/l/j/machine-0.log

pbuilder-dist wily login -- save-after-login
that 's where i found the `` spec '' : )
so even if they know about it , using the network to fetch the image without actually /booting/ from it
lspci prolly give you some info to google on : )
no pressure , i 'm pretty much done for the day
do not get you man
i know that ubuntu developers care a lot about what we 're doing
learn about and practice with the tools that ubuntu/linux provides you . learn about how a linux system is built

is this command used to remove all packages installed from remote ?
would autoremove still erase old kernels of the target system , if there is any ?
is there a way to download the old version from the store somehow ?
that is just pure evil

pulseaudio start/running , process 12585
and in your chroot terminal type export display=:0
i 'm not getting any failure : ) i was asking if this works now
could it be that it tries to open some tooltip or something ?
you can ask in # ubuntu , since its not related to xubuntu or xfce , and see if anyone

because we have n't found the real issue yet

yeah ... i recognized this late yesterday
downloading and re-packaging
and what exactly happens when running it using sudo ?
nope . i try not to comment on matters i know nothing about . sorry..
if you set that up then you can also use an schroot environment for running `` debuild -s '' easily
on ubuntu there is an app called `` disks '' which shows you how much space is used

i know we 've successfully helped several users configure usb displaylink devices - what is the device id ?
can you explain what you mean by that ? and what you mean by you see two devices ?
there is no lock
there is -- assert-multi-arch option
but cool i can dig through that and rip out everything that is not needed
no , otherwise we 'd have a pile of apps not working at all when we introduce this

can you run two video drivers simultaneously or do you need the prime-switcher goddard has ?
unity , gnome , kde ..
did you install environment-modules ?
did you install it ? ?
dunno , but there 's an # aws channel somewhere
is there another way to get to it ?
is there anything running on that tty ? sounds like there is n't .
no . still tearing after all i 've tried . : (
sorry , it was for you ?
no . it should be just a little private server for small stuff like znc or postfix
it 's not much more than throwing a bunch of debs somewhere , running apt-ftparchive packages | gzip -9 >
ah . my suggestion would be somewhere in ~ .
?
the kernel comes from the debs
right , ?
confused . they 're sequential or they are n't . e.g . sda5 + sda6 + sda7 = sequential
cool
but , your choice , really
sorry : )
i downgraded kernel , and removed thermald and it works ok oo
which is the hook used to process desktop files .
do the chinese characters all show correctly ? or just strange boxes
i do n't understand where are you mounting the nfs export on your local machine ?
hm , hmmm
yeah , i 'm not worried about that
i can have a look

yes it is

it does n't add much unfortunately - the line we already knew in this case from the assert ; so
and everything 'just works ' and we 're on the road there but we 're not able to shift it
only for china at the moment , you can only specify a chinese shipping address
do you already have windows installed ?
that 's quite true
your choice . the scheduler has n't been turned on yet , so everything is open : - )
that is what i mean ... boot the pc with a working distro , create a vm there , and
if i did ./start.sh in the directory it runs perfectly
this means you .
*cry*
that has nothing to do with scapy .
i do n't want manual ; i want it to be able to spin up containers automatically like it does
what would have been the other option ? : (
eek . if it was clean , i 'd say screw it , starting over wo n't hurt anything .
a series of four question marks is surprisingly vague about what you 're asking .
so , just ship a static file like that and all should be well
vm would be best -- i know that might make it harder to reproduce the problem , though , your

sudo fdisk -l ?
you 're just the only oem in the channel right now to bug . : p
so does upstream g-c-c call pk , or is that an ubuntu-gnome patch ?
obviously . you bios doesnt detect the drive .
it 's a slippery slope , for sure
ok , i did n't know that
but if someone takes over the system tru lets say vnc , and sees the terminal with root ... he

to achieve what ?

no , it only does the default calendar , known issue , we are working on fixing
do you have a xubuntu-desktop iso ( before the 9th ) handy that you can share ?
lol
hah , that 's due to new flake8/pep8 rules coming along which i disagree with , but perhaps i will
that would make sense , indeed
although finding the actual bug would be good - maybe *as well* ?
yes

again , it will be good
would putting it in blacklist.conf be a better idea ?
my advice for you would be to run some of the default tests and look at the results
with 75+ tests that 's not a trivial change for ci . there is also likely ci driver code that

beagle and pi use arm , yes . what 's that got to do with it ? ; )
i am , yes , had some nice vacations
yeah as lxqt approaches , it would be valuable . maybe a show off session

makes sense
so do you move _all_ devices that possibly do n't have a time remaining to notification # 2 ?

ok cool i 'll jump in there
heh . , i want the updates
what do you suggest i do ?
is there a *.conf file in /etc/x11/ at all ?
but my user is not supposed to own that folder
so wait for a proper build then copy it over ?
what i mean , is can you get to a terminal login with < ctrl > < alt > f1
i expect the lib will be fine ( looks to be officially supported and uses the apache v2 license )
heh : - ) i know that feeling . pmcgowan would you know or be the man to talk to
no way , i can not do that ...
looks ok
in compiz settings , when you hover over this workaround , it says `` use with care , it will

that test could indeed trigger the address watcher twice : once for the initial , another time for the update
tcpdump needs to run with root rights , thus sudo . and it 's still a rather bad idea .

it 's due to uefi vs. legacy .
just open a new terminal . it will be defaulted to the user you use
actually that was in 3.16 also , so ok to just drop any g-i-t deps
sorry , i 'm not familiar with the program .
what if you poll manually in system-settings ?
what does adb devices show you ?
a cross-build farm that attempts to cross the entire archive and watch for regressions is the right answer , but
you might just as well open a bug with the log , as we have a bug *somewhere* : )
this is a beginners help channel , we get asked where the penguin is .
again , ubuntu is not android .
as i remember , you should download the package from chrome web
yeah , i was thinking that , but still feels like a band-aid
maybe you 'll hold on for a few and rephrase your actual issue , first , you said you want
yup
did i get the date wrong ?
recovering a broken raid0 is going to be an exercise in pain/futility . time to restore from your backup
we think that would be useless to ubuntu nginx users
for production i 'm doing php/html/css/mysql application development , and various tools there .
ok , i was just worried this bug had fallen through the cracks
what 's the graphics device ? & the driver ?
one sec
this command broke the kde-runtime . sudo apt-get remove xterm uxterm
it used to fail so we switched to our thing
i believe
no mir needed . post-migration is the wrong time to ask for the fixing .
and he still has a 500gb disk and a cd-rw in there that he wishes to use
are you on trusty as well ?
that should give you a description of what that kernel module is for
fully agreed , i just wondered for a second where the pad entry had gone
it 's in trusty as well . yeah , it 's great !
do you have a valid point , provable ?
ooh , nice list ty kindly
mine too
or , maybe even simpler
looks like there might be a pci bus windows issue . can you `` dmesg | pastebinit ''
that 's really interesting !
i remember you mentiong it too
yes indeedy
sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get dist-upgrade is how i 'd do a kernel upgrade
please do n't ask to ask a question , simply ask the question ( all on one line and in
where are we between `` release business as usual '' and `` omgwealldie '' ?
ok good to know . now how do i delete all this
oh ... the docs say `` there is no implementation for this yet '' : p
the retrospective should n't be long .
so i have a similar problem in that the mysql-server package that previously depended on mysql-server-5.5 now depends on mysql-server-5.6
without export ?
i already have the document ready , you will be writing immediately on review and approval .
yeah ?
but depending on python-pip brings in pip into the part
i guess we can just try , as it should not be too much effort updating developer.ubuntu.com/community to point to
the default is /sbin/init , but if that points to /lib/systemd/systemd it should be the same
it will crash by itself .
why ? live image wont change anyhting on your system
*click*
it seems so . system-image says 192 is the oldest image
must say i do n't agree with the idea of jenkaas , not outside of quite specific environment requirements
i knew you 'll say that : )
our bug report is on the tracker , it will automatically point to the new bug . you will see
cant believe i just did that lol
: d
i use gigolo.. though , in the menu on the mac , i created a share that the linux machine
yeah i 'd do qemu it can emaulate hardware
more : i rewrote the scope basically from scratch , and did see the same issue appear once
i can trigger it manually for you , but cihelp would have to be pinged anyway to see what happened
shift ~ .
i 'd expect upstart-sysv to contain exactly the set of files that conflict with systemd-sysv , upstart-bin to be empty
my kingdom for git rebase : )
ah , got you
the previous commit will raise an exception , but does it tell you what the proper format is ? my
i 'll have at all this audio setup again maybe with next ubuntu release , or something : )
no , not at all .. many have done it .. i however have not , i have no direct
it has a key generator built in
so , for example , so long as you do promise to fix it later
whats the right place for that ?
no ?
the latest one for your ubuntu version

dobey : if you get logged out , do n't actually try to log in again , just reload the
er , how are you doing it ?
that 's more complicated ; for debs you can choose to build the package again during autopkgtest and run teh
supposed to be 512m
so , probably exporting deb_build_maint_options=hardening=+all above the current dpkg-buildflags calls would do the trick .
nope never did that as i can remember .
do you know which revision of the motherboard you have , 1.x , 3.1 , or 4.0 ?
anything else i can try before i shut down and lose this chat window ?

yeh , no hurry
it 's hot . also , i have to do the drying up before going to bed and i 'm

i need root really - vm would be good

multiboot is nice because it can drag n drop iso 's easy
and tells us with 100 % certainty when a txn is n't in use
more just for the folder i am concerned with
ah . no
orange or grey overshoot ?
also , what exactly are you running ? is this a demo server or usc or unity8 or ... ?
have you looked into telepathy-accounts-signon yet ?
checking , but then it 's gon na be hard to tell if it 's because i 've relocated to
it greatly decreases it .
aside from the fact that i 'm really stubborn , but that is not the reason ... i just do
best wishes for a long and happy marriage !
hey i have a strange bug with qtcreator + n4 runningn vivid where after running the app on the device
webdm is linked against a version of snappy that might not be the system snappy
if this is a new test , and known upstream , seems legit to disable that one ?
`` sudo lsblk -f ''
ok
i tried testdisk , which is basically the same . and i tried testdisk on the disk image i created
what if you run kaddressbook at the command line ? so it shows a more verbose session , and then
sudo ifup eth1
awesome , thx
you can make ubuntu look the way you want
i5 4690k
either way - fake raid is not something i 'd recommend to you
well just poke around your efi and try to make sure it 's got legacy boot enabled and preferred ,
what are you booted into right now ?
dist-upgrade will install new versions of packages , whereas upgrade will only install fixes to existing versions
on the frescologic support pages it says `` for fl2000 in usb 2.0 mode , the maximum resolution is 800x600
i 'll try and do that after the summary plenary , but i ca n't promise anything
mplayer , as i said
but oom is n't directly killing the dbus process , so i dunno
that should work
try google-chrome instead
i know , i know
see the pages above^
ok , so i wait for you to approve my mp now ; - )
hmm , so whatever is causing this
last time i checked with scopes-client it was exposing playlists as expected . perhaps we have a mismatch in names
it complicates things to have to run a second process , containers can only have a single process
no , it 's lack of drivers
sounds like you 've done something funny
ah , got you ok
ok , so there will be a real landing with mps to trunk after those approaches get tested , right
does it show driver=
hah . well , i suppose there might be dependencies from other things..
btw , can you reproduce it only on krillin ?
i 'm not familiar with that source and i 'm not about to look it up for you i 'm
hmm , you are correct , something not working right . it 's not generating the map correctly for rebecca
nah , jazz is hardly ever recorded and i have just not bothered , i do n't play as often
everything is 0
14.04.3
yes , dd
yeah i just learned that earlier.. i am using virtualbox and mounting my .iso as a cdrom and booting to
yeah , that 's all good : )
yeah , i ca n't seem to resolve that .
i 'm not : )
ok
yeah i 'm sure he knows about the issues so meanwhile copy-package is friend among else
what did you do ?
run what it says and pastebin if it fails
where are you up to ...
right ; that 's directly into the kernel , so something in userspace is hanging somewhere . how long have
there is a way to do this , if the driver and display support it via terminal and the xrandr
true , ca n't wait for that
does the same happen if the netbook is powered by the charger
or browse intel website for linux wifi drivers
updated bug
did you run a `` sudo apt update '' recently to make sure you got a recent list of package
funky ! no idea what could cause that .
ok , i 'll block 19 then .
can you check the content of __bases__ in each case ?
i actuually need a holiday form my holiday ; )
verified both ?
this channel is english only .
yes .
gnome-terminal has a menubar ? ; )
well , seb128 said around 10 would be missing
also , i 'd like to get it sru 'd back to trusty - should i just go ahead and
if i have a window after beta freeze , i 'll handle this , one thing less on the list
please pastebin the output of `` sudo blkid '' .
try `` cat postgresl.conf '' no & here
we did notice that the spreadsheets have changed , so maybe they modified the api somehow ?
can you set bios to uefi instead of legacy and try
i 'm happy with that , was just wondering if this would be handled the same as go-amz
so carry on with autopilot2 for now.. this should be fun to track down for someone else : - )
ok , i 'm keeping tail -f nuntium.log running anyway .
ack . so yes , i 'll continue reviewing , but it 's not on the top of my priority
i guess someone in foundations needs to rebuild stuff
interesting , i 'll have a look
systemctl cat ubuntu-snappy.boot-ok.service
i would also go for syslog and dmesg
but we should stop writing /etc/mtab in installers as a file , and set it up correctly right away
a longer test is running which should take ~30 minutes i believe .
haha okay..
i guess i do n't understand what this helper tool is telling me that i ca n't already see on
right , now i can make sense of the log entries .
supposedly /etc/cron.daily/apt ?
or are you asking multiple questions ? ; - )
copy the files you want somewhere else then a usb pen drive for example
has it always been that way or did it just happen recently ?
my english is not so good..i forgot many vocabular..i am from germany
or maybe infinity ? ^
it 's ubuntu stuffs your working on ?
i dont know , what is a problem ...
well deduced
max size for an ag is 1tb
ok , i will fix it , but it 's tough to fix as its working fine on my screen
mind-parser
so listitem.standard/header and such are gone ?
14.10 : d
can you bring up the `` process for proposing a new repo in github.com/juju/ '' in the leads meeting tonight
cool -- and , ah , i see what bugged me
^
i 'll check
most of the other clients are in good shape now though
pure audio cds dont have any files or an equivalent of a filesystem
it 's a bug in d-i .
hello mate
no , you are right
ok , i 'm using allow from localhost for mythweb
i 've not heard the response
you started a build of the whole whack ?
most probably the boot problems are the same on all flavors , so double check with vanilla ubuntu , and
you can also apport-retrace it locally to provide a backtrace
not entirely sure what has landed since feature freeze , i had really bad flu for 2-3 weeks
fyi `` lspci -nn '' is more useful - it reports the unique [ vendor : product ] ids that
well very nice to meet you ( though i 've talked to you on many occasions before )
but alarm api apparently does n't use the qt role api anyway ?
`` qemu-img -- help '' reports the supported file-formats . i 'd assume that 'img ' meant 'raw '
ha
ohh , maybe split these out into a tools or bin package ?
not just ones i specifically configure
can you paste a link to an example you 're seeing please ?
akonadi-kde and akonadi-server
yet another learning experience.. let us know : p
upstream/maas-spaces rebased seem to be ok though .
they are n't broken in plasma 5 , it says the option for different wallpaper for each vd has been
as that one destroys the alarm cache
make sure you pin the gh link to that revision so its a perma-link
how are you ? . i just moved to sweden : )
ok , so just the 2 branches ?
i have n't understood why the error triggers when the write permission is enabled
you just said you succeeded with unetbootin to make the usb ?
if you want it in ubuntu sooner , you should propose a merge into the development release ( wily )
is the larger monitor set as the primary ?
sometimes the people providing the funding would expect ownership
but also install the guest additions ( i do n't think they 're default installed ? )
ah , ok
sure , but how did it _happen_ ? ( will it happen again by the same means after i click
will the program block because certain pipe ends are n't closed
i gave you the wrong switch ( -si means info on only inactive sets , and the sets are all
( having added a user before )
unless its been fixed
none
you could try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration ' and choose another keyboard from there . i you have nothing to change
yeah that i did n't know the term in english
but you have great backups so that 's not a problem ! right ?
popey , yeah , the minute you send a call for translations to ubuntu-translators , you get a bunch of
the nowtothesecond ( ) stuff - that was cargo culted from elsewhere . i believe mongo has timestamp issues
so you are running mate desktop
pretty much ...
sure , but that 's a focus decision , which is more likely related to surface being user-visible than being
ok
confirming
cool , that 's great
maybe a mirror issue , let me point directly to the main archive
driver by nazi . classic .
you just push to it
same for initrd
huh ok that one i can see but when i click through from bileto it just says `` no such
`` sudo ufw deny out 137/udp ''
i would try the open ones , then , the supported ones in the repos.. then , i would try
you said you had a problem with the installation ...
by the way , the system installed without any problem , but now it hangs ever logging in
which , i assume , they originally tried to do from github , found out that does n't work ,
ok i only run server never use desktopmanager so i wont be able to help you with that
14.04 repository : filename : pool/main/e/espeak/espeak_1.47.11-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb . maybe fix you packager manager problem and install properly ?
there 's no real point ; that device is not going to work with linux since the manufacturer provides no
not at all , unfortunately - i am pretty unhappy with it actually due to several `` decisions '' made
it has n't been fixed in ubuntu .
nice ! i 'll definitely be interested in looking at that
ok , i 've written up my suggestion on the bug and will switch to your pr now
you took traces me thinks
huh ? what is that from ?
why do you want this ?
i installed pepperflashplayer it says flash player version installed on this system : 16.0.0.296
we could try to be more forgiving of incorrect set_crtc ( ) calls , e.g . , log a warning
yeah , good point . anyway , so what happens if i enable dev mode , install ssh , then
make sure to put a % u in the exec line of your desktop file as well .
lets see what a debuild does
the cd ?
well it 's your root / partition
yeah , that 's right
package libxfce4panel does not exist in vivid
ye
dont try to stick on lts . which is not latest for drivers
just pastebin it here
i installed it already on my system
if the device is locked adb will refuse connections immediately , it does n't hang
i see - and the rpi bootloader loads something from disk itself ?
which ubuntu release is it ?
apache will only report if it 's an apache error , this is not , this is a config error
yeah i have the partners repo
awesomeness
yeah i understand what you mean . i used to do a lot with the partitions when i was new
as long as the packaging makes that happen cleanly
oh yeah ? : )
what server is it ?
i found the www-data group , but i dont know how to list its permissions
did i misunderstand `` multi-booting '' ?
maybe unity8 is not getting any input at all
but yes
i did n't see any discussion
that 's not a question for here .
already installing it manually
so far i 've seen a lot of use of tox to isolate all that in a venv
13.10
boot
i like to be predictable
well , then you 'd have to contact the authors of that toolkit i guess .
if it is n't working , try a reboot , might be something else getting in the way
either install the latest drivers in 3 ) and have them work or revert to 2 ) safely
i know there 's a bit of jiggery-pokery regarding env vars for windows -- we were doing < something >
excellent , sounds like a success . to double check , can you do a `` pastebinit /var/log/xorg.0.log '' again
have you checked whether the debug symbols archive ( ddeb ) already contains that - usually added as a repository
which archive so i can check ?
i 'm afraid i cant . as i already said , you have to worst gpu on this planet ,
just sits there like this >
tyvm
you can now do `` sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall '' and it 'll do it for you
ad-hoc is opposed to infrastructure mode wireless , which is the common type
it adds it to state , validating it exists on the provider
did n't you see doko 's e-mail and my follow up ?
have you tried looking at the console of a node booting ? but that does look correct
keepalived
yeah , absolutely . and then i can start with the user docs , already got needed infos by nick
try ubuntu
if it blanks the phone screen ( i 'm not saying it should n't ) , it should n't show
and maybe i should file a bug ?
what 's the point ? if you want someone to have a program on another host , ssh in and
i installed in wily . when i use it , it 's all black and unity8.log shows `` qxcbconnection :
i do n't really want this to go in the wily archive .
i do n't think it is getting closed twice.. if it were , i 'd expect to see duplicate ``
samba ... it made me chuckle , that 's all : )
np , stay tuned : )
also , if you file bugs against ubuntu-ux could you be so kind to find the corresponding package and file
nope i 'm not even clear on what you 're saying is happening
remove and create the account , and use adduser if you want , it 's interactive , i prefer useradd
beagle i have one .. and a panda ... + 4 n810 + 2 n900 +1n950 +n9 : )
sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade , see if that brings you further
that 's assuming you 've confirmed -- debug does n't cause significant performance regressions or other change in behavior
there is one thing in run-checks , but we have the same issue
i have n't noticed
the labels are on the filesystem , not the disk .
can this list be updated over the air ?
so this improves the ghost app situation , but does not completely fix it . i 've unlinked the not
sure that 's always the way , needs tier 1 ( no internal depends ) fixed then we click rebuild
it 's never been altered in it 's 8 year history , unless the upgrade changed it !
ok so regular ubuntu , because i started with lubuntu n it barely comes with anything , superfast bootin n
are you there ?
right now , simply can not connect . `` connection reset by peer ''
what exactly ?
no , there are lot of alarm issues in vivid
errr , you might find it less painful to download 14.04 and clean install instead of a hot upgrade
none
the kernel from proposed give me a display back but with the wrong screen resolution
think he was already quite frustrated by the lack of answers , and making the wrond assumption about en dash
looks like this package is about 9 years old , i would strongly recommend not using it
then you can simply remove xscreensaver , it is not needed
a consumation , devoutly to be wished .
i net you did n't say that ^^ ?
there 's no point sharing that information here
and why do i need libqt5 stuff when my only installed de is unity ?
ah
we are testing a package we built else where on the vivid machine . the machine was dist-upgraded to get
yes
which means the % u is n't picking up the full filename
very interesting
cloudy is good , right environment for juju . but juju is also hot , hmm ? : d
ow ... sorry then . try fdisk or cgdisk/cfdisk ( forgot the name )
it does n't autoremove
+1
yea , i can be convinced we 're wrong for sure . honestly , we 've not had the uptake
what 's your spec computer ?
generally , yes , just pay attention to what it wants to do . if it 's asking to remove
sure
yes , but none have been a question yet
there is also a large # samba channel
still around ? could we get you to verify that our freshly baked kernel fixes the arm64 boot problem ?
does it happen after starting a particular program ?
good call
yep , looking
sounds like its playing with variables in $ env
if you know a password for root , you 're doing ubuntu completely wrong .
both waiting for qa since friday
uptime says 6 days , cloudinit says the machine was created 15 mar
that 's fine . this is n't exactly a priority .
i did . same problem .
ls a : ls /media/ $ user
ah ... are you handling that signal ?
what os are you currently on ?
run ubuntu-drivers list
anytime bud : )
certainly not while lp staff are on vacation : )
tough to say . there 's lots of little fiddly bits to iron out , and some other priorities just
alternate fix would be to make whatever 's dl ( ) opening that library be more conditional and less violently
yep . i 'll discuss that at the session today . the goal for vivid was to decouple the packaging
no , that box di n't show up at all
hold on , let me call a mac genius .
anyhow the plan is to release konvi 1.6 final in very early april , before the april 9th deadline harald
laney : we should be good once this watch_only build finishes , had to change some parameters
nope
: ) )
no cheese installed
do you want me to push it to the ongoing landing once it got merged to the staging ?
i really wonder what does the `` rebuilding '' means when patrickdk and teward say it but do not explain
i 'm pretty sure i 'll leave future ones to you fellas . i suppose i have to file a
it all goes in there , yeah
ok , i made a quick branch before going eod , if you could review it would be sweet
? ?
i know , but it got ignored then
nb : the driver is present , just the firmware is not
we control the data that goes in and out
especially since i assume you have to take the machine into the directory before you can authenticate against ldap (
in that silo
ok , type mount | nc termbin.com 9999
ta
and i have a demo in 20 : )
we do n't assist nor advise any of those
log off , log in to the unity 2d session . much faster , no compiz garbage causing issues
actually , ignore the last line ... `` lshw -c video '' would be good
sorry for being harsh on you
anytime
probably makes more sense than pursuing a bunch of stable update exceptions , and gives users a more obvious view
turn off how ?
i 'm the wrong person to ask that , because i 'd say you whould n't put logic in qml
are you good with scripts i have one question
we saw your question perfectly fine the first time
yeah i 'll sleep on this and roll out first thing tomorrow .
i could if i install openssh-server and connect to the wifi . not what i want , though .
should , yeah ...
you said you have reinstalled . so , you use the new system you wrote overtop the old one you
sudo apt-get -- purge remove linux-image-3.13.0-32-generic linux-image-3.13.0-40-generic linux-image-3.13.0-43-generic linux-image-3.13.0-44-generic linux-image-3.13.0-45-generic linux-image-3.13.0-46-generic
it looks like that package has never had its files approved .
14.04
wouldnt i get in trouble using that ?
hm . well if you freeze using nouveau and the proprietary driver , then something else is up .
what exact lumia model is it ?
tbh , it 's now 1:30 here . =/
probably i should start from there . installing ... lts-vivid
yep , cheers
i whined in # is-outage @ canonical , someone will notice .
for dev of ubuntu touch ?
within an hour , or tomorrow morning ; i 'm checking a potential regression for users with many apps /
do you have ssh access to that machine ?
20_ubuntu-gnome-default-settings.gschema.override in the mentionned package sets a gtk-theme but no gnome-shell theme
youtube doesnt show anything usefull either , only an old touch preview on droid 4
try in the middle of the sea
i want it to work without pusing button
your welcome
already tried that
depending on which components ?
i am trying to print it to pdf
drama ?
most of the rest is blacklisted until ghc itself builds
any errors if you press f1
hmm , did i screw up the logic ? it ought to always pick ( 2n+1 ) /2 * coretesting.shortwait
wily fde , just to make it fun ( or because i 'm a masochist )
it 's odd , because i '' m borrowing phillw 's lubuntu vm . it 's on kvm on a
so what needs to be done to remove 5.2 ?
and then hope that whatever i reproduced is actually what 's happening .
well , this image is oooold
took _awhile_ to get to work
: d relax i was over reacting
it broke the tests for me yesterday
i need the package name . as in apt-get install { package name }
well this is an ubuntu channel for support questions
looking at it 's build-depends : ?
if you can hunt down the mysterious test data source for me , that would be awesome , then it
you cant
i dont know i see alot of same issues on web about this model having problem whit bios
i was thinking that list would simply list the available ones and status gives details for a specific one ,
now go check your bp
given that the inputs can change in somewhat restricted ways
oh alright , i will try to mess with that quick .
create an entry in /etc/fstab to mount /dev/sda5 at boot time
mine correctly picked edmonton .
not yet both me and victor are battling trying to remember how we got around it lol
what doy uo mean 2 video cards ... sli ? or 2 different cards ?
yes you can set that to 'publish without qa '
where are these ?
^^^^
well , via adb , ssh or the terminal-app it is a normal ubuntu
and then the unit-x.log files are likely to contain useful data , in addition to the machine logs
i am going to be unavailable from 13:30 till 15:00 tomorrow . hopefully that wo n't impact my chasing .
what 's the adapter and driver then ?
is it the right way to store container mac address for now ?
im running the install
ah , they 're just dbus properties . good .
so i see that you 're retrying `` upgrade in progress '' which is fine , my concern is are
wait what only shows the desktop and not the phone emulator ?
gtk-launch does n't work on windows , does it ?
of course : - )
can i private message you ?
but indeed we 'll end up in more problematic situations sooner or later since we nowadays tend to be ok
ok so then pay attention to what i 'm saying ...
wget ? not even dget ? heathen .
did you get my email yet ?
fyi aug23 : n-c-c/next most recent time-triggered , successfully completed run . ( the aug30 runs were sabotaged by undercloud
there are unit tests
every time a test fails it tries to write some extra logs and at some point ( probably on a
there are search engines out there
yeah i can tell you more on how it goes after this weekend
you using windows ?
read ! i already gave you a link
right , but how can it be changed automatically - like when building the image file ?
ya , it arrived on friday
you have 16.04 right now btw
you mean it is a server issue
i 've got more stuff to do now
it will , only attach rx/tx/gnd though
cheers
want me to help you set up the slots ?
yeash squashedn + added stuff that was added later on..
do n't worry about arch-restricting , it ignores modules that do n't exist , iirc .
regedit it seems to relate to hooking up monitor to the hdmi and suspending sometimes
i 'll be in touch with you shortly then
thanx
well , without any set width on rowlayout , as you told , minimum/maximumwidth does n't work
dunno ... my guess is that they do n't have that ... they do n't really like people being able
; - )
what are you trying to make work ?
right
so , sudo apt-get install skype ?
okay . unless there is something weird going on , it should only be stating those files to check that
qemu or a machine with a non uefi boot
you 'd expect to see a few entries ending similar to this : `` linux-image-extra-3.13.0-62-generic/trusty-updates , trusty-security , now 3.13.0-62.102
and unfortunately i do not have any experience with syslinux ... is there a bugtracker or something where this should
and i get that argument , we 'd need a designer here who actually thought this through
i thought you just said it worked on ubuntu
`` can not find efi directory ''
ot 's stuck at the boot with this message
that 's called google cardboard
the people you registerd the domain with normally offer that service ,
then why has the page not been updated in forever ?
why ?
yup
ok , there 's also grub4dos you can boot the .iso from that if you install it to the laptop
1.7.1 ?
no . but what is your actual ubuntu support issue ?
if you use apt to install apache it will also create the user and group needed
this is probably related to the test_suite='snapcraft.tests ' line i added to setup.py
one is marked as koffice but it is koffice3
if you can get the file name from your friend that wrote the script , we can use find to
i 'm thinking we probably want the return value from m.runner to take precedence
no problem , just ping me if you are free later
rsync /etc/apt ?
yeah there is . just ca n't access it : /
with 50 not found bugs ?
pushed , shall i kick the build ?
it 's not unrealistic
i 'm taking kids to school as well
oh cool , lp must not have sent me email yet . i 'm reviewing the branch now actually
? ? ?
i hear ya !
you more curious if it works at all ?
testing needed now for frameworks 5.12 update
our git repositories are the ultimate definition of waht is applied
ok
: )
is it be wily only ?
should i select 256 jpeg ?
# fsoc
hmm , i must have done that at some point when trying to fix it .
it 's actually a bug in the terminal - in that it does n't know what a url is
its barfing on not having an inventory
where do these meetings happen ? somewhere in secret ?
i do n't think that 's an option in amazon ec2 .
what do you think about the talk ?
ifconfig
is there a way to disable the osd during testing ?
they are not logical , but plain primary partitions , as can be clearly seen .
and did you ensure there is no other chmod process runing ?
something to do with the fstab configuration

it updated alot of stuff or seemed too , its alot of stuff to pastebin , should i still pastebin
enable networking should do it
if one of the interfaces is up and has an 'inet addr ' then it should be connected
but i would like to help on that
there has been no good remote experience since 3d desktops
i 've got to take a look at it , do n't know exactly how big it is
somehow you think those two things are mutually exclusive ?
that would be fabulous

the saying goes , bigger is better.. lol
yes
lol~
no , not right off hand , but could search for it .
what is the current directory ?
i see . what 's the preference for usb ?
i know the bug is old , but i suspect it 's the same root cause as in my cause
at the moment , clock app is using the old deprecated listitem just for the listitem.expandable usecase..everythign else has been
already there , thans . ihave juice , but it refused to allow my password on connection . im tired
seb128 - omw
but i can run xorg as non-root last year
i 'm thinking more of when an event becomes true , so maybe not for testing the base layer
the folders are based on pkgname , not appname/version so things can share
i can build it from the upstream tarball , if that helps :
so to echo this back to make sure i understand
despite the troll wars that happen on the interwebs its just one big happy family of different des ; )
but they ca n't access each others home folder ?
did you change $ wlan to the name of your wireless interface ?
say no more ; - }
uh , that screwed it up completely
hmm i do n't use amarok , now and then if ever , use others , but amarok has a
i was almost confused by `` space '' there . : )
but i saw some 'deinstall ' there
if the system is already using uefi that is what you would be best using for ubuntu too
what is this `` finder '' ?
both with and without a phone , it just looks absolutely useless outside of obviously harder to steal since it
in the store already , we were missing a `` description '' field .
in which case , grab cs.req and check it
ah ok , i was hoping it in mir-demos
what is the platform you are running on again ?
ok , just a moment then
actually those fixes not landed i am thinking of
not unless i click a menu
but sure
you 'll see kernel messages if/as the device is detected
what 's the venue ?
it will stop you participating directly on an ipv6 network
you question does not make sense to me , sorry . but ...
yes looks good
do you see the device with adb devices list ?
line 88
not in main .
because oem config does work with no slideshow present .
so take this somewhere else please
we 're mostly interested in how the ssd is connected to the motherboard devices
i have seen those errors as well , but it still installs the necessary packages required by the sdk
my options are fmask=0022 , dmask=0000 , uid=1000 , gid=1000 , should n't that make it 0755 ?
yeah , that 'll be much better , cheers
just install apache on your server
not , as chrome has a flash player build-in
writing letters mostly , maybe an occasional essay or a table ...
give qml another shot ; its a really fun and easy language .
^^
but i installed ubuntu desktop
see above
try to reset its password by booting into single user mode
but thats not a default
you *can* , and i have , setup port forwarding , or put the server in the `` dmz ''
adding to my list
i cant get my wifi to work on xenial , think it could be kernel related ?
it shipped with this fix .
)
feel free to join
it is , but i can encourage someone to use ubuntu without ever mentioning the fact that it 's open
yes
and that also already answered my question , xdg/autostart means on login , not dm .
it seems that not all the changes proposed have been merged then
?
sorry , i mean /etc/udev/rules.d
did you come up with that just now ? or are you quoting something that i 'm too un-geek-hip to
we 'll see
put it this way : i like the init part of it , but not so much the rest
see the implementation of the oauthmain component
are you in a live usb right now ?
no . you have to read the link given by ubottu .
i just realized i have the same graphics chipset as that bug report .
or well , land the same mp again , actually
when you boot up , you get a login screen , right ?
like games ?
nope
was n't sure if that 's what i needed though
are we not running timedated on desktop yet ?
yes , tried gksudo and gksu
hehe , yes
no worry , i 'm looking at different issues as well
i wanted to install a wireless printer xp-615 but i failed and now i got this errors evrytime i upgrade
a squirrel
just come back here via freenode webchat
oh ! but you 're back on ubuntu-mono icons now ?
yeah , if someone could prepare the sru diff ( should be really ) easy that would make it much
and `` upgrade '' just updates currently installed packages ?
there was some pushback previous cycles to do it even in stable
np
gut , danke ! setting up autopkgtest and apport retracers for xenial : )
and that cjwatson 's patch will fix - its in fine tuning mode atm
yes , it requires mir .
for the kernel module , if loaded , of atheros ar9462
perferably aosp
yeah they will go away in next release
that set sounds correct , yes
yes
i tried this already .
dmesg empty
just doing my part .
just adjust its width to suit , and redraw to use that width ( as a gridview will do )
lotuspsychje : should n't i stick with the additional drivers list ? feels safer ?
that 's why i recommended adding a new rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/ that does for the rs* devices the same actions
i just rolled out a small train change ( just a code cleanup , should n't be any noticeable behavior
next , can you try adding `` -i '' to the list of pollinate flags ?

just to split it as it 's a different line of work/issue
if apport hooks wo n't work , then something in the postinst script to check if port 80 is bound
yes , it could , but the thing is that it did n't , and because upstream still does n't
1 second
why can i do it then ?
what 's your problem ? are you able to login ?
copy the command and the following output and put it into the pastebin !
your fakeraid/motherboard wo n't give you the raid you want ?
you 're not going to get that .
gim me link , i 'll fix it for ya
it was all fine until i installed nvidia . t_t
yes , no driver claimed it .
last time you mentioned a bug report about plymouth , did n't you ?
you find one ?
not true , as the difference changes between daylight savings .
using it for what ?
hopefully not - that is the power for the bios 's cmos ram where the settings are stored
amd has *issues* with drivers on linux depending on card
there 's not an lp bug for the race issue
no
that might be useful .
if there are no installed headers , everything is not usable like vapi/pc-file and so on
in bytes i asssume : )
actually , the problem is with companies which apply dmarc incorrectly and/or restrict their customers too strictly
oh , that was a couple weeks ago . reality and my intent did n't align , clearly . :
all the service saying ok
copy the output and paste it in paste.ubuntu.com
do you know about any more mighty kill option , its just for test purposes so can be dirty ways
it looks like you 're the lucky scribe today .
no gaurantee of what ?
also make sure you have all th elatest updates/upgrades for 15.04
sil2100 : seems i ca n't upload the new camera to the store as 15.04.3 framework is not defined in
but that 's is too much infrastucture for us roght now .
in os context , that 'd be memory footprint
optimus is hybrid graphics intel+nvidia , not a brand
it 's like dpkg vs. aptitude , rpm is the package manager , they use yum now as the user
full disclosure ... . they 're not anonymous either .
are you ready in 2 mins for the stream ?
hehe , there is allways a model slightly more expensive and slightly better : p
it 's from when there was a ban on broadcasting gerry adams voice on tv
ext4
so if there 's an error in it the error will be in the test too
you should try overclocking the cpu -then- install a fesh copy of the os
i tend to agree , though it does not have to be bullet proof , it 's the way the
maybe # ubuntu-devel and/or # ubuntu-packaging
: p
what are some things a new user should be learning ?
what did ya say ?
i 'm not saying amd64
better start the right way from the start right
designs are changing.. but so far it seems
should just be able to run $ dch and then type the commit message
that is certainly part of it .
yes but we 're finding more stuff with not routine use : )
so if you reinstall ( easiest choice ) your networking probably will start working again
hey , last meeting with us it seems : - (
i 'm trying a few more confs now ( so far tested lxc and kvm connectivity )
hmm see lines 734 onward , 740 speaks of the disk being made wrong
ok
sorry , it did n't give me a warning
o kk so why is this 1 file ( one of my most important ones ! ) read only ?
no , but we will probably support that for git .
e.g . bzr ci -m 'fixes lp:1497299 ' -- fixes lp:1497299 -- unchanged
so why do we even care if some helper function uses yaml.v2 instead of v1 ?
well thats just it , the only usb pluged in is the mouse ?
fdisk is my second choice .
how 's your network ? : )
o/
how to get it ? easily !
so if an older maas , no volumes are recorded but the node is still allocated . juju will get
i know , i am just explaining how that is achieved technically .
what happend to iages on frontpage ?
you could try undoing what you did by booting recovery mode
i do n't see any output , where might it be ?
when you get the error that /sbin/initctl is n't there , just log at debugf level
if your kernel got updated that sounds like a good candidate . try booting the system with the old kernel
england .
the 386 tests ridiculously slow . we can not get a fast cloud images
yea , its confusing . i dont have a vivid machine right now . i just noticed that libboost-python-dev and
hope that explains a bit of the ci : )
ditto e.g . cloud-final should say after=cloud-config.target wants=cloud-config.target
quite a bit of that looks like it 's not even starting settings
yeah , the important thing is that the source folders are structured correctly
ill brb
i 'm pretty much only keeping it for gaming and taking notes lol , ca n't find a note-taking app
i might break that view . i am trying to add columns that give more incite
so looks good ?
in my gopath , launchpad.net/webdm is a symlink to ~/workspace/canonical/webdm
done . no change .
ntp does n't set the time zone
i did the upgrades but didnt reboot
that should be fixed already
yes , or create a config so you do n't have to
yeah it plays for me too . but those 20 minute videos ( episodes of a show ) do n't
i already suggested the issue could be hardware , since you are on an different hard drive.. you stated you
rename ?
boot the live usb
not back tics
so whatever partitioning they have when connected , the controller will just ingore the partitioning and overwrite it when the
correct
yea , i can understand that
hmm , one sec just matching up your image with the earlier pastebin
you need chrome , not chromium
so , when you have launchpad building snaps , i suppose you will activate armhf only upon request similar as
i was , yesterday
do you alo have the same that konversaton in vivid stores logs in ~/logs ?
*nomodeset*
looking at the commit long , i do n't see anything that should be affected
all the images i have for the feature tour is on our server
yeah , distros based on ubuntu still are n't supported here
ok
do you understand what the 'source ' is for and what the chmod is for ?
do i propose the juju/testing branch in the same way as juju/juju ?
and you 're delivering the errors to inappropriate places
does that make more sense now ?
the ubuntu font rendering is different from other distro like fedora and such
i got some , but none from happyaron
take a look at example
the instructions for running local provider w/ the docker image are outlined in the charmbox readme
that solution stops working with app isolation , clicks/etc
1.4.10-1+build1 is a better version number ; it 's clearer , and bigger than 1ubuntu1
that you then import into your browser to gain access
double-check ( and triple-check ) those paths .
firefox here , maybe it 's special .
maybe ask slangasek

press ctrl+alt+t to open a terminal , and then type `` sudo fdisk -1 ''
you had that handy : )

are you going to play us a live stream of david hasslehoff like in the good old days ?
ta
just depends on what 's on the receiving side
thats the only way i could enter an x enviroment before
right ; this is less invasive than grub_terminal=console because it only disables the handover , not grub 's entire graphical
have you added ppa 's of any kind ?
otherwise looks really nice !
chrome does n't tend to play all *that* nice with things that should be going elsewhere in xdg-open , but
it was funny in my head
if i was writing a wrapper around stub that just added some functionality , *then* embedding would be appropriate
you are on an hybrid laptop
bah ! keep forgetting its the live iso : `` apt-get install bsdmainutils ''
when i went through it again it installed grub without a problem
then the whole line will be left as it was except the change
k , think i 've found it : uniter/runner/jujuc/ . however , where should ours live under process ?
do we support that for other components ( e.g . storage ) ?
no , and never do that - 777 is not safe
why ?
ci is supposed to auto-unblock once ci passes , right ?
right , but this problem was alway there , right ?
diy = owncloud
right
thx !
so lets be 100 $ certain we can see the grub files before we change those
delete the lpbuild directory
ca n't make the meeting ?
i booted earlier today with break=bottom and tried `` chroot /root readlink /sbin/init '' which returned /lib/systemd/systemd
i have n't seen it yet .
steart by running alsamixer in a terminal . make sure volume levels are up
hi . using vivid-server 15/latest , atm
now you are closer to fixing it though
you might to clean format and make a new partition table on that usb drive
perfect , use that

the -exec bit
that is what i did .
your extremely big pr to master was merged
out of curiosity , did # kubuntu # kde or # lubuntu do any troubleshooting ?
due to 384 mb ram : ) i use lubuntu
ta , was n't really for the tech , but just a generalisation , works for me : d
why are you so angry about black people ?
if i get round to finishing my copypackage ( move=true ) patch , then you could just use that in
it is a fake !
so , i 'd like to know if anyone has answered to me , in the meantime
weirdo ; )
maybe its a kodibuntu issue , did you try this on lubuntu ?
good : )
ok , sure thing !
welcome , what can we do for you ?
paste an ls -la ../../../vendor from the directory that contains that script
i 'm doing lib*-perl from levels 1 and 2
yeah its a good fallback/workaround definitely

i was looking at bug 1465196 , but have n't made much progress yet
do you know what the deal is with including the full copyright text ?
is this just a trip or will you stay longer ?
i do n't think so ... . it sort of has a simple beauty to it , in fact
alright
ther is section on this wiki how to create one
through usb , i plugged it in , and nothing popped up letting me know i had something connected .
someone from the ubuntu docs team has summitted a commit to the manual on github
i 'll check my install again in a bit , going for food now
have n't been multiple vivid kernels to try between , at all ?
ok , something really strange happened
got it . changing mirrors did n't help , but it 's in the partner repo anyway which probably does
usb creator will wipe it anyway
did you upgrade to a different version of ubunut ?
if you choose 'something else ' in the installer you should get a screen like this where at the bottom
it basically allows remote login , so you want that to be configured properly .
heh : )

yeah , skip those on wily , it depends on the mp you reviewed earlier

tks , not paying proper attention .. !
great
have you updated hplip with the hp version ? the verion in ubuntu is super outdated ...

hopefully not : d
did you use the debug option to analyse why ?
heh fair enough
but ideally we would want this in ota8 otherwise it could be ages before this is fixed ?
i guess it 'll be an array then
ok , so start what is different from your system than the standard ubuntu install ? proxies ? etc
i do n't believe so . i 've never used the optimus stuff myself . but if you 're disabling
can you boot into a live system , start ubiquity , get past the `` i hate my freedom ''
also , switch is not an issue because telephony works just fine , one that is connected through swithc
not resolution
those , at least , are fixable
i never said `` auto_clean '' , i said `` clean ''
re-install ?
try sudo vgchange -a n
because uninstall is different then purge . the later removes also configs
yeah , i 've never looked at the code , but it might be sort of smarter than that .
can we help you ?
cuneiform is the writing system they used , yes .
yes indeed .
i would also recommend lfs101x - a free course at www.edx.org

sorry , i missed you asking for a link
if the above was unclear , it should look something like this :
yes , but rather than discussing bottom up , i 'd like us to have a top down discussion
ask your actual question
we 're going to reinstall grub anyhow so do n't worry
try some : )
does it show it being blocked ?
you can set youtube to favorite html5 above flash in ettings
do not store sensitive data in public . questions on that ?
you 're probably using grub2
if the 2nd does n't have hardware that requires proprietary binary blobs to be loaded , it should be fine
ok , waiting for the next britney pass + publisher run
?
applications are not build on snappy , so you continue to distribute it as .debs which people use to build
eeik ... - ok - you are missing `` some library ''
so perhaps the test runner uses a different mechanism ?
no , i915 for my intel graphics controller
no
ncdu is a nice application
it 's not a laptop
can you look at my charm branch change ?
can you report a bug ?
apt-get install nvidia-346
ksnakeduel ?
the machine not the os : )
config_ppc_powernv_rtas does n't get set to 'y ' when adding a patch for opal_prd mtd_powernv_flash
since it is an item ( parented to the page ) , you could even anchor to it now
so , i should reinstall and repartition the whole thing ? even the ntfs partition ?
yes
^^
thats fine , but i 'm not going to make my toaster cook eggs
at what point would it make sense to factor out our go simplestreams `` bindings '' into its own repo
whether i will break something if i sign off in the spreadsheet : )
no idea the script produced a docbook file
re the performance aspect i was thinking there could be a single goroutine which writes to the file , using

if you have an ordinary live os you can boot and not run an installer from , you can fix
yeah exactly
i have done a reasonable job of splitting out the types that needed to exist
why does it work briefly when i press the power button then ?
shall i try resume normal boot ?
before will be fine .
can you run md5sum `which ntpd` ?
the steam client has been out for some time now
it would pay for a round of beer , yeah : )
how can i call feature when i click on launchbar few times and window selection appears ?
you mean in the unity settings ? ?
yeah
as in a released version of 1.24.x ?
not valid no common issues
even than it would fill up
save the previous file first , for diffing
i said that very same thing 14 minutes ago .
yeah forgot the hash , and then realized it said `` correcting automatically '' afterwards
vps
and that happens for all your apps or just that specific one ?
oh like a mac address ?
should i reboot to recovery mode and run fsck ?
this script just changes resolution since system wo n't recognize my monitor so i set it manually but when i
we can only , realistically remove bootchart in 16.10
what will that do ?
focus rings
no , just make sure it 's chmod 600
would you like me to paste dmesg as well ?
ok , great
hmm , i tried that and ended up with all kinds of stuf i did n't need ... but i
here i would myself have to look how the helper setserviceconfigattr ( ) works . if it should not also
can you send me an email about it ? i 'm a bit busy right now , can look later

corrupted in which respect ?
yes
ok i have a fix , but it breaks the tests - they assume that values are changed immediately
what audio chipset do you have ?
so just touch the file then
yes , we 're looking into it
yea i 've checked the cables..
just earlier myself my main ssd froze up , 3 os 's , however i have images of all them

what is your end goal ? what problem are you trying to solve ?
bug 1429354
logs of an application
oh yes , there were those
you 've been looking at bug 1438489
great , let me open a bug for it
you just did ; )

bug 1513590
that is an operating system not a computer
for libreoffice , you 'll almost certainly hit the hardcoded path problem
is it broken or just not styled well ?
you still there ?
yeah , just published this morning , will be in the next rc-proposed image
it should be easy enough to repro the issue and then work from there
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
i 'm pointing you in the right direction . that direction is `` do n't write a web brwoser ''
i 'll investigate if that actually fixes the remaining issue i 'm seeing or if there 's something else going
does that mean 343.22 and newer , or only 343 ?
ubuntu is n't fedora
alright , well . if you can assure me that this is all reproduced locally , that installing the right
yes . and trv should probably be a ui for that library .
i 'll publish if you say it 's good though
you are in it .
i 'm afraid that might be true of quite a few files : )
does the username or the password contain any 'special ' characters , such as non-ascii for other languages , with
debian-installer pulls in udebs from the archive during its build , so it 's by no means as simple as

yeah ... mvo is on it

i 'll try making it start unity8 then
done but it 's look like first
si mi piace il cibo fatto in casa : d
mmm , ok i give up .
it is eod for me , so will make some notes in that card about what is needed and start
no ...
yes , acutally filed a bug report today due to an issue amd64-microcode
thans
tell slangasek : )
wait 3 seconds ?
sure
i 'd greatly appreciate if you would n't involve yourself in my queries , being in here is not my
yeah , it gets bind mounted early
you first have to 'click ' on 'software and updates ' icon
well it depends what kind of development . like for example when i had to build the latest qtcreator from
i 'll install the minimal .iso
fully agreed : )
stanley00 : basically apt-get update is giving a lot of errors .
pxe boot ?
try to submit a bug on 15.04 or try lts stable
i could just say ppa ; s are not supported and we would be done .
does a vlc or youtube give you same tearing ?
logging with cat seems to work fine
so it 's embedding the oxide qt stuff and not webkit-gtk ? or what ?
indeed
link ?
and thats the box which i was using and its not printing for some reason
jump to vivid when it is released : )
we can see tht it should be x each time and it went x , y , y or whatever
3.5.0+15.10.20151024-0ubuntu1~102+201512140615
what 's that mean ? ? ? ?
should be in /home/username/.local
the state server is a proxy - if it does n't have the iages it fetches from cloudimages.ubuntu.com and caches
wow , only 5gbs fully unpacked and that 's including the original cliks & data.tar.gz files
i 'll see if anyone is not running around fixing last issues to get 1.8 out of the door
davidcalle , i 'll be leaving a bit early today , and off to the xmas break until the 4th
what i mean is that we do n't need this connections { } in surfacecontainer at all
i dont know who he/she is
for cloud stuff you folks at canonical implemented a rather scary entropy service providing random data over the network (
and yeah , do n't paste a bunch of lines here
general impression and ideas for improving nav/style
fjkong : sent .
no problem
10x a lot ! one last question - is it possible to take the ubuntu server iso and create from
hola
oh , yeah , that one is needed
so use unrar to let it make the file again it was in the beginning .
nexus
selendroid
though i have n't used that much myself
would be great if you could start that !
there is no /autostart/ in /.config/
sure
the second one there is a merge request for the translation thing up , so maybe you should prod kaleo
the downloaded files are stored in the app directory .local/share/app-name/
if you use # ubuntu+1 channel people are happy to talk about it
i did n't cross link them
# ubuntu-touch
whats not true ?
does n't seem to
yea , doing it myself
you sent me a contentless ping . this is a contentless pong . please provide a bit of information about
ok , i can try that . i had a quick look last night . perhaps it 'll be more
also , 100 % pass rate on silo 33 on a krillin
probably very wise ...
btw , did you see my autopkgtests ? ( i subsribed you to the bug iirc )
you can copy your home directory over , that ought to be a good starting point for most user-facing programs
i 'm talking about kernel configuration
ca n't do placement yet anyway
yes and that 's not my nick ; )
right , sorry . i meant have no selection screen . it just boots straight into ubuntu .
extracted as in `` dpkg-dev -r < package > .deb < package > -dir/ ``
did you have to manually configure it ?
with my via chip , i dont see it.. but , what i do for the `` timing '' is
i tried to program a tomcat-hosted spring based webapp then make it as a snap
no idea about afs or other network filesystems..
asking for session overlays ? but that 's the right thing to do , and constructive ?
sure
ok , it seems due to dual-landing implementation issues i ca n't do it this way ; /
or change the theme as several people have pointed out
all safe
is that ok debfullname = `` aaron honeycutt ''
are the turn/stun bits typically provided with the spreed codebase ?
at the time , everything was based on simplestreams - that was our language
that is cool ! by the way , have you figured out `` organize '' ?
thats so annoyying ...
you can also try # xubuntu-devel for xubuntu specific things.. otherwise , use a supported version
i will tell you
what are you referring to with `` i have several things working at the same time '' and you want
i was just wondering if i might have been hitting a mir bug now : )
when you say graphical - > rounded dots ?
the simple power applet can be set , by default , to not be shown all the time.. i will
if the code is correct and the issue is server side - then i would n't want you to have
i have n't noticed
ok
as i linked , enable nomodeset , then boot 'try '
is it know/expected that it takes two taps/clicks in order to switch focus between windows ?
once being trained on a product it always is hard to switch seamlessly
heat is waiting on python-designateclient which we have an mir open for
hybrid intel/nvidia
i will report a new bug about that
popey , davidcalle : did you guys have anything to discuss ?
yes , but then there is this other compelling lib to add ... and a week later another one ...
you mean `` burn '' the iso to the usb stick
smb : i will write a blog post about the proposed changes
i instlal it manually with dpkg
well , there might be some dbus call to get the data or system-settins actually saves it internally ... probably
linux in general
wait is n't it a us holiday today ? what are you doing here ? ; - )
ok ?
server is cli only , yes . but you can install gui afterwards if you like . it 's just
oem is clearly broken , on i386 and the end user setup i 've an account for the end user
no it was adduser , its useradd
no
well.. i got more stuff to learn about at the moment i am trying to get certification in java se
i clear it up and now we ahve total 5 mp on neutron-api , charm-helpers , quantum-gateway , nova-compute and
actually let me rewrite that
sure , but , testing will show you that thats not the case
yeah , saw that : )
if you open it in another non-private browser is it slow ?
so this ppa brings some new driver updates , right ?
^
ah , i just found the setting
i mean swap the dvi and vga cables between the monitor .
i did manual partition on that step
because i ca n't sleep and i was clearing kanban and replying to bugs and found your email interesting :
excellent , that 's worked out nicely then
depends what disks you 're mounting , perhaps one partition / disk has errors fsck needs to deal with .
i remember we had that in some nokia symbian devices ... it was pretty useful
you got some ideas ?
why do you need rdp ? is the website resource-hungry that a thin client could n't process it ?
good morning
it can take *ages*
will that scrub the file ?
i get 'hashes : -\n ' after building
a nice approach is changing the docroot of the site to the home directory of the user doing the upload
yeah the syncing is definitely impacted , but i have a hard time believing that google is incapable of making
i would gladly say yes , but i have offered too much of my free time already ; i can
no worries
the kernel team is supposed to update the touch kernel with bz5 patches , not a priority to them until
well , i havent looked in my canonical acct , but in my regular acct i get a lot of
if we added them manually , that would n't be an issue , as we ask for a name anyway
yea i can see why , ideally i 'm trying to find something intel based with boatloads of battery life
yes , that 's how i understood it too . the format containing a space is n't part of this
any case , now that we know our target for 1.3 is ota8 , it needs to get fixed and
no , added : )
no worries at all
any questions , feel free to ping me , or 'trainguards ' to get somebody timezone-appropriate .
i 'm also still waiting for boot info script results.txt and an exact grub error message .
oh , that 's weird , but easier to check - cheers , i 'll look into the devel ppa
`` realtek chipset update '' ? maybe whatever that is , it broke the modprobe code
we might suggest that to yubico ...
maybe i 'll just make it ul/li items ?
for some reason `sudo netstat -tapen | grep `` :8000 `` ` did n't pick up the 0.0.0.0 address..
so now you search for that using `` ls ( hd3 , gptx ) / '' replacing x with 1-5
*bg*
is the debug log from the client or the server ?
sure
switching back and forth is annoying . i find it easier to run ubuntu all of the time and start
let 's see if we can find some photos of the pc opened up , or a service manual
i h-i-g-h-l-y recommend a class 10 microsdhc card .
i 'd suspect there is some clue in the syslog though
would you recommend ubuntu 15.04 or 14.04lts ?
command | xsel , then pressing shift+insert or middle mouse will paste the output
ok so can i do a no-change rebuild before then ?
old-style vms created for wily on wazn
and where to put there ? the interface uses categories
include steps to reproduce
i 've only had really one event lol
well launchpad gives a 404 , and i ca n't possibly be a member of it , and not be
ah , taking a list of args and passing them to the command line as flags ?
cool
will i be able to upgrade it from the upstream repo then ?
sorry fix winds and remove elementary was the corrrect syntax
check for uuid , if the file system is present while you are in emergency mode
explosive tests are fun .
i have xserver-xorg-video-intel installed . i also did `` sudo apt-get install -- reinstall xserver-xorg-video-intel '' just now , but
is this not just telling me how i can change the login shell ?
well i was trying to write a python script for dns spoofing ...
they are still there
boot a live iso , chroot-mount the target and run `` update-grub '' in it
i get 7 hrs of batter ilfe on my yosemite doing browsing + compiling latex occassionally
im wondering if i can use some rescue disk or something to load the kernel for me
yep , as you ; )
when do you get this crash ?
do you want good open-source support from your video card ?
sure . and i suggest , again , *not* testing with streaming video like that..
nopes
daniel requested something like that at some point from some other branch set , i said `` follow the force^wprerequisites
i can leave that for now and fix this
do n't be ridiculous , i would n't knowingly hold back information .
you wont get rid of it completely : /
so far everything is handled by the .desktop file . but i 'm arguing for an api that lets us
and why are these not included in the initramfs ?
ok cool
but a minimum of one to use as a ceph osd volume
okay be right back
how would i do that ? ( and why did i not assume that tab would n't autocomplete in here
so keep it false in the .conf - copy . how can i determine if it is enabled to auto
rfkill unblock 1
if we ca n't change that then maybe not , otherwise it would be good
right . i 'd dump to json : p
are you seeing a test fail in ./worker/uniter in master , by any chance ?
so something that scans every five minutes and reports these types of problems would be good
we are testing dimitern 's fixes now . 1.22 took forever to test because of the i386 regression
you do n't have a proper database , or not configured .
i must have downloded the incorrect iso
my impression on channels is that there 's a channel for everything . precise + phablet ppa ? sure !
which is private to the host at the moment , because it is on a bridge ?
no kwallet . xubuntu !
is it a script that will just be for your user ?
right
14.04 is long term support . if you really need the lastest shiny stuff , ok , but otherwise you
on ubuntu phone ?
blackbox is n't supported in this channel
i have a nine month old baby and a tired wife and frobware has a wife going into hospital
and i have a pr which hopefully solves pingersuite.testagentconnectiondelaysshutdownwithping and machinesuite.testmanageenvironrunsinstancepoller
sure , one moment ( brb )
oh , it sort of just gives up on living due to the jail apparmor and seccomp created for it
if it is installed and not encrypted you should be able to just mount it in dolphin in a livesession
good : ) this is where you employ intelligence than . look at the osi method where those strings occur
we should kick some as there have been a number of landings
use 'apt-get autoremove ' to remove them .
on it !
your first msg to me showed \\efi\boot\shimx64.efi
does n't seem to be too slow ( or as slow as on the bq ) , but i did
sure , totally
also on pc
do n't add more confusion to the issue , please . i have responded to pings
but the error message you have , it 's just a bootloader issue , nothing wrong with windows8 or ubuntu
good old json !
fresh is no better , unless it is for you .
linux-image is the name of the linux kernel package as packaged for ubuntu .
ok ill make a new complete capture then with the enumeration on this machine here ... ill be off some
there 's lp._browser._connection.authorizer.authorizerequest buried in there , which may be useful
something i did wrong ?
you 'd have to speak to the package maintainer in centos ; that 's not in the upstream config file
oh , right ... yeah , i should do it
aha , ok
actually the mount options option is greyed out
yes ... it 's fixed in 15.10 , not in .04
yep
i have not been able to do so so far
yeah noticed raof is the maintainer
are you talking about a remote with lirc or something ?
yeah , makes sense . let me refactor .
there is a channel for saudi arabia at # ubuntu-sa
done .
i am trying to install kitty
sounds like just an old package , seeking for old libs , that the updated files are n't needing or
yes please
why not move /proc also to the ssd ?
same place as in any other distro
i was looking up for the existing designs for the click scope , but they do n't seem to be
sudo lshw -c network
you held it down whilst unplugged ?
probably because the root file system was not writable when you tried to edit the file
that first commit i referenced is already applied , i guess you just need the scripted one
imho dropping the package bluez-test-scripts and adding a new one bluez-tests would be the best way
was it in response to a bug ?
i was just looking for confirmation that 1.26 ( 12.04 ) 's -k is exactly parallel to 1.27 's --
with dhcp in the installer i 've never known it to not configure correctly if the dhcp server is handing
is it me , or you noticed that locos are not any more active like before ? !
ppa 's ?
devices : that 's it
5m on the mako
haha
any uefi menu ?
what about qtcreator-plugin-qnx and qtcreator-plugin-valgrind , as well as all the -dev ? these are also built from the old
same kind of line added , sdb , sdc
i just realised the small fat32 pertition i have is probably a uefi partition
sure , but what 's the convention ? maybe there 's something we can use for consistency
if my directory is in home will that guarantee that my files wo n't be deleted , or are all
maybe try removing all of your add ons
i use ubuntustudio . if you read and experiment , you 'll learn quickly . if you break and then
i doubt it but you know computers , things always break
that 's great just remembered about it so thought i 'd ask while it was in my head : )
it blew up
yep
come again , please ? ? ? ?
can i kill those apt processes ?
i 've pushed an mp for disabling the job in cu2d-config . it will likely be monday before it lands
enjoy your family as well !
yeah we have run into that many times
sorry , was distracted with other stuff
so if you dont have a program listening on a port , that port is not `` opened ''
correct
indeed ; it feels to me like that tag is giving false hope
really ? with 1gb ? i 've done it with 256 before and that 's slow . 512 is ok
i could hug you
i guess a 'debian ' branch of the same repo
cd /home/deepika/
run lesspipe over the three .deb files to check them
like what : ) . i dont know much and have to learn this way . basically if i dont
and stick around on this irc channel , that 's a good way to get into the community : )
definitely useful though
yes it 's annoying , i actually wait when i 'm typing stuff .
do you think i 'll be able to install virtualbox on a usb ?
hi
is that a yes or a no ?
to use with ubuntu ? or just general use
perhaps
yeah , that 's not what i 'm struggling with
reconfigured , package deleted
in what way is that to do with ubuntu ?
coreycb : pymysql is also going to be key - we have main projects switching for b2
type cat /etc/grub.d/40_custom | nc termbin.com 9999
dpkg -l bcmwl-kernel-source ?
yeah . so if you could have a bit of patience , your phone is the only instance we know
uhm , no , the keys have pictures on them . they do n't match then . let 's not
np
oh hmmm if qa granted that means the excuses will stop updating ; - )
no physical damage i hope ?
other than flash the phone with the correct os image , what more can you do
as i ask , above : )
do you know any debian channel i can join to explain the issue ?
fair enough and as long as we have enough scheduled until then .
`` based on '' ! = ubuntu we have no way of knowing/supporting the changes so ... ask ! mint
this is trusty on ec2
i feel overly worried about hitting dput ...
is your system based on efi or bios ?
also which version of ntpd ?
*if* we support the frequency flag
i mean , unless you expect ethernet devices to mention they 're pcie
hmm ... define milestone ?
no , totally not fine with that ...
i prefer integration
i do n't need that thorough a check - the third party stuff has to be added with -- add-module
but the desktop file is still white , even after making a simple edit and re-saving w/in gedit .
*click*
hmm git confusing me , i pushed something
what os 's disks do you have ?
awesome . but how can i edit the colors ? am i suppose to be able to execute the .desktop
i have a random thing on my system that makes no sense : p
i never tried it .
can i usefully source a file from inside a hook script ?
let me power up my arale
or should that be bond007
dell 7348
i understand you 're having a problem with the etcd charm wrt testing calico
yes i do n't see why it would n't as long as you opened up your firewall to allow connections
i got nothing out
the crypt meassages came up too
there is server side api in mir now so
probably wait until 14.04.2 is released ( next week )
np
is this ubuntu ?
bug 1464630 if you have any suggestions : - )
nope .
oh , the other thing i 'd suggest on top of the code change ( which is good ) ,
sudo apt-get install xchat
it uses it to start ssh
let 's do it then or later
was that command ok
then pastebin those in channel , perhaps someone can help you out
it 's a low impact change , so if you really do have a need for it , i 'm
do you have any preference there ?
not here at least , you 'd have to ask support from the fork developers
assigned the bug to you ...
you said it yourself
yes
gce , aws , openstack , etc
i have a pr with that fixes purgemissing for the `` huge txn-queues '' situation ( and various drive-by fixes
that rule is pretty old , with nowdays tons of ram , but ubuntu demands a swap partition anyway and
are you on the ubuntu live cd now ?
yes and no
hang on
should i just remove the sources then ?
ok , let me try with those
uhh sudo ubiquity ? : d
making me got crazy for the last hours or so.. ok i 'll do a workaround for my tests
there are linux tools too
ask in the lxle channel then
referenced from a tuple , a list , and a dict .
before i start digging , any ideas on this failure ? `` ld : bfd ( gnu binutils for ubuntu
it is a method of basesuite via cleanupsuite , which calls patchvalue inside
eres chileno ?
i would like to install now one downloadmanager to support resume function
?
what ?
have you followed the work in bug 1422290 which seems like it may be a proper fix ?
how do i issue this command and use the specific device id or prefix instead of `` hv huion ''
i 'm a fresh flash yes , followed the instructions in jibel 's doc
you mean with the current image ?
librarian is dead : / so no artifacts from launchpad
xubuntu is ubuntu
yep we are working on that right now
build-depends : foo | bar
that sounds like a plan . vila , bac i 'm happy to co-own it if that helps
maybe they could add to ubuntu-restricted-extras ?
welcome to ubuntu-za
no no ; fares dip this soon before
ask your question here mate , someone might still know
do n't worry
^^^
yeah ... there 's 5 . i already reported a bug to that web store about it : d
i dunno , i 'd like to get daily updates
wich ubuntu version are you on
please ask your questions in channel so that anyone can answer , and see the answers .
i might try it , but it 's annoying .. i have that setup through a script for server usage
i changed the socket it listens on , started it , ended it , and started it again
clearly the test is not related to my branch
and another folloup that either deletes the json or actually tests it
before the above // remove the usb ! . and try and boot the install - reset in bios as
yeah . i did n't actually realise before
somewhere in the guts of wine there 's a setting for sound ... ask wine channels for directions
sudo service lightdm stop
ubuntu-core-config should go in
hmm ... might well be this , yes , but ca n't tell where . line 71/72 from the paste
are you on kubuntu or ubuntu ?
no ! i would n't touch that with a barge pole !
no , we were stuck in willy to open , and then , i retargeted myself
so it is all good free wise then ?
right modesetting is off which is breaking your setup , causing a nasty legacy 'fbdev ' driver to be in
enlarge it , it might hide more sliders to the rightside
quantum-gateway unit tests are fixed too
that version of dolphin is quite different from mine .
oh , then the man page on manpages.ubuntu.com is wrong . sorry about that
okie dokie , will re upload then as that
yea
reboot computer has been enought ^ '
it 's bad enough doing that with config-changed ; )
ok , it 's just starting a bug report off with 'i installed a custom version and something broke '
did pikachu come back ?
can you choose where to mount it ?
try sudo apt-get install -- reinstall xorg openbox obconf
it has a list of the checksums of the individual files in the usb , not the whole .iso
it is in the landing tools menu
sounds like they need a dhcp server . allows them to change network settings on all of their network at
that looks pretty good , although some are redudant . when you put it in the file , i would
i can ping upstream to do a release once this is in
but chromium is smaller or bigger than firefox ?
yes . i did already
interesting how you treat each dconfchangeset database separately
it fetches the children with gio api
i did not comment them out .
yeah . it 's hitting the jenkins build timeout which does n't give the test a chance to cleanup and
hey , i 've stupid questions to ask : my wily-ony silo is good to land ( after qa happy
is there a equivalent of `` highlightwhenpressed '' ? or do i just set hightcolor to `` transparent '' as
looks idle
: ) it 's ok i will fix : )
what language ?
and which kernel are you running
are you addressing the group now ?
it boots to the lightdm login screen , but ca n't login
why ?
ty , : )
yes it 's currently my only phone ...
is it planned any time soon ?
which ubunu are you using ? 14.04 ?
does n't work
nothing more ? ?
paste.ubuntu.com/11957897
you 're missing your keychain in your ssh account , so it ca n't auth you in git
which would have the same problem.. yay for abi changes
i just checked the kernel source ; there have been 196 patches to the rtl8188eu code since v3.19 which is
yes you can , but it might not be possible or might not work fully for all hardware
theres cubase for linux native ? ? /
ok
so install it as explained in _integration-tests/readme.mf
what is the exact url ?
okay
sitter logs out , rather than lurking
i have every confidence : - )
in the webcam-webui example , config.py is finally copied to the /usr/bin/config.py . how can this be done in the
good to know !
yes but do i have to logout and login to find out ?
what errors
this is a cherry pick , onto a project that did n't have patches before
pitti : the new tarball ended up in the 2015-06-25 queue item
yeah , noticed already and committing fixes .
yeah , hoping this might help .
`` xrandr -q '' should list all available modes for each output
runner exited : watching volumes : permission denied
please delete your one and i will make sure those folk are sub 'd to the other one
( vi is a text editor , not an ftp server )
i have webkit set to skip in jhbuild configs
well , let 's just blast out everything then ...
you try to use gstreamer directly ?
yeah , sometimes ; mostly for gcc and similar , as otherwise they 'd be stuck forever
you can run some commands from the terminal to check what it sees
ok cool . it 's a bit much to get you started on the spot ( i 'm in a
wlan0 or eth0 whichever you 're using i have no idea : p
in the user home directory
true ! : )
no , statement of fact . oss now can co-exist without replacing each other 's files
you 're missing a packages declaration
ok , no problem
you could maybe use qupzilla
same here btw
i noticed that the listprocesses state method ( as i last saw it ) is effectively a bulk call into
that depends on your graphics driver
appreciate your comment : )
good think i 'm in nz and it is 8am then
no idea . i do n't have multiple monitors
i 'm guessing you have a vps through arpnetworks and the server came with that repository by default
ah okay , so actively closed : i *think* we send the same signal
what is the issue ?
ideally , the creator of the hardware would
no - i 'm working on a production server of critical service . i could probably get a restart eventually
so yes , in vivid this was still the case
is that with proper ppa pinning ?
you trying to download ubuntu from torrent ?
i have to just write my message instead of message without any sign and so ?
whenever an ifup @ .service starts , it re-triggers network-online.target with the wants=network-online.target
only a matter of time
ok , so now i make a new text file with a text editor like mousepad ?
not a desktop : )
yes , now fire up the ubuntu installer
why would n't the ui just show the currently active apn as selected if none are 'preferred ' ?
let me check and install totem first
logout is broken
run `` cat /etc/apt/sources.list | pastebinit '' and paste the url here
ok
what is going ?
screenshot ? ?
yes . just replace set +o history with histfile=/dev/null
i 'm getting a error from lp about building the package anyway
ok
what does the command do anyway ?
well , i can only say it regressed today for me
the source caching stuff is in ppa : ~launchpad/ubuntu/ppa if you feel like chasing it up

got fail2ban installed ?
yep , true
yes
ok , that 's good to know : )
probably not , he says it 's the first time he 's done open source stuff . it 's not

yeah specs are more than sufficient
dinosaurs everywhere ! also the air is much more oxigen-rich
what version of ubuntu ?
start a root shell
also try a different usb port
yeah
secureboot and fastboot disabled also ?
can you try something like `` sudo nano ... '' ? and enter the password
i have the same model 11,1 and chili55 's answer in that url that worked for me . all good
free now
you did try in your session to start plymouthd
you can also create dd images under windows with win32diskimager
dpm : i 'll put the oem article online , and could then look into writing such a script
e.g . at which level do apps come in
right , but that doesnt bring us closer to why ifup is hanging !
i now see 2 x hda nvidia digital stero ( hdmi ) and 2 x hda nvidia digial surround 5.1
really ? how ?
tapping that should cancel the purcahse
that does mean
very well , now it loaded and i commented on the issue
( 1 ) that 's important to put same serial numbers for both disks and ( 2 ) scsi-virtio controller
no , it just hits a black screen . i see plymouth for a short bit then nothing
yup ... that and a hijacking iptables rules to redirect to proxy : /
is it normal that kdepasswd to not be installed ?
right now customers have their own deb mirror for their specific variant on top of ubuntu
we have changelogs
yes , that 's the onw
k
ok
ya ... i havent checked if it was usb 1 or 2.0 ... its an old proliant ml150 g5
you might need some code which hasnt landed yet
nvidia ?
so does that mean it might have been x refusing to reply/give it up ?
so then i need this ?
sudo
also how to undo it ?
yes disable it
that is probably the whole story behind the switching of the partition from encrypted luks label to `` unknown ''
and the other one is done - i hope the reviews are useful : )
what does `` id -u '' report ?
is that better ? ( remember to f5 , canonical does heavy caching.. )
watch out for issue valorie just had
i mean when i boot , these are the things i get on the screen
open a terminal and do : sudo apt-get update & & sudo apt-get upgrade
as long as you 're using the version of the library in the repository and have n't hand-rolled your own
go ahead
thats also true
dpkg-source : error : detected 4 unwanted binary files ( add them in debian/source/include-binaries to allow their inclusion ) .
it is not strange
i restored a disk image made with ubuntu disks that was working on another usb stick ( 2.0 ) .
do you have a one line command for connecting to the serial console of the 3com switch ?
yeah , i get that .
k , i noticed that as well
did n't check main vs universe though .
why ?
are all the issues caused by the linux server that has samba/nfs installed ?
ouch .
probably i did n't drop it in stable , please do
udev is in 14.04
i 'll let you know : )
could be i will test it but as far as i know , with cloudbase-init for windows the metadata is
right , we 've gone through all store apps because of that . the incompatibility is because we shipped something
how did you create your usb ubuntu stick ?
when will the next 1.24 ci build trigger ?
well that 's my guess , from the log it 'd sound like they forcefully try to install the being
have more pending , here .
pcap ?
one would think that `` intel-powered x86 tablet '' makes things easier , but in reality i 'm having problems
from wine ?
provider for a certain setup ? oh , the pypi plugin just gets pointed at the buildenv and uses it
well your situation is n't really worthy of much consideration since your disk is failing anyway , so i do
i was wondering : ) my xps 13 is also running trusty , although not really dell drivers anymore but
both
it 's not actually really started at all
mute it : p
it 's only a problem when one lags behind the other
have you used any other grub controller like grub customizer ?
so runa memtest .
no my sim is not pin locked and it is also currently in my old phone . should i restart
cool , nice to meet you
export path= '' $ path : /path/to/your/script '' in your .bashrc
ack on znc being assigned back to me
yes
have you checked the mount settings ?
yes
fix your nick please
( essentially separate tests )
this bug is not about dependency , with sddm installed we ca n't switch profiles using nvidia-prime
but not now , first reinstall ubuntu
well ... i did n't try much as i was just interested in getting the shell working ...
usbutils is not in the store
i will install it on the same if its possible
caching services*
oh yeah i fixed that already ( or at least it 's fixed for future cases , for silos that
note that the same silo was used previously for syncing mir 0.13.0 and its downstreams ... the silo was then
the issue is that 1 ) harvesting requires the full archive 2 ) it 's a heruistic as many ``
what are you planning on doing ? : )
pastebin it
it wouldnt run if its not valid
ok .
could be all sorts of things .. does the mb support > = 8gb or 10gb of ram ? mis-matched
type sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
yes , it works fine here too
ok : ) while it does that can you show is `` pastebinit < ( df ) '' please ,
^^ ?
services stick around , targets come and go ?
that one is for the wifi , you should see also for the graphics chip set .
i 'm not a geek as you , i dont know about essential information . the popup alert shows that
yeah : )
do you get a result from `` lsmod | grep hp-wmi '' ?
given that it does n't happen for most people
meeting in half an hour or so ok with moi
both dev=1 and dev=2 do not give me any sound , and if i try dev=3 i get `` playback
awesome
wich package is this ?
the popup tells me
it is a 2560x1440 screen .
ah
perrito666 , and since i ca n't see a test for finishrestore anywhere
^
then hit the dash and search for gpartd
you 're saying that i should disconnect from the wifi while i have an ethernet cable plugged in ?
good morning mate
whats that mean ?
it will be , soon enough .
sure ; most packages which do that use xvfb ; the ubuntu touch packages require running on a testbed which
on the 1.24 branch , i was using assertfilecontains rather than assertfilecontains because i figured having both functions was probably
no one have
15.04 i dont know the codename
wwitzel3 said he had worked on boto quite a bit , he 's peeking at the issue as well .
the device passed to `` grub-install '' is where the mbr boot-strap code goes . `` -- boot-directory x ''
do you use apparmor ? why ? why not ?
all i know is that aac requires it , so when mp4 container has aac audio .
yes i do . what does ./configure -- help say about libraries/linking ?
how 's windows 10 ?
thx ! how 's the weather looking ?
`` they will also give away all their personal information which you can sell-on. '' they 'd be fetching for
probably because you 're a bad person ; )
yes , 21 is for experimenting with some abi changes , we are n't going to land anything from it
is all of that moving to git ?
k i love changelogs ; )
ack
ok , but they would let us know if the service was interrupted because of that , right ?
perfect .
otoh this could cause relatively random crashes anywhere that 's using regexes in qml
interesting . is your harddrive running ? do you have another computer from which you can ssh in ?
do you have a windows 8 iso file ?
but at upgrade time we have useless data download unless we have binary diffs .
that is disappointing . let me look at the dl kernel module source ; see how it recognises the device
who 's doing the intro with mark ? is it mhall119 ?
how often does this happen ? like , infrequent enough ( 1 in 1000 , less ? ) to chalk
yes
yup , i have the same list .
exactly
: )
good point . it 's a bit odd as we need a phsyical machine to be the slave . and
sure , i 'll ping you some stuff for you to take a look at at your convenience if that
that 's it exactly . i 'll subscribe and see if i can help with more info
line 2409 : `` [ firmware bug ] : acpi : bios _osi ( linux ) query ignored ''
have you installed 'libfprint0 ' and maybe 'libfprint-demo '
form a support question on a *single* line please
please do
i know i`m too tired for this cuz i have my web pages on 150 % zoom
those numbers are the numbers that are listed when running mke2fs -n /dev/sda1 | tail -n1
i assume the same would happen with a desktop though ?
8.04 was 2008 , that is 7 years ago . old hardware get dropped after some time .
you did n't share the log !
but the radeon driver is quite nice . i use it myself .
did you have a branch for settings using the new pageitem , btw ?
we can probably go smaller , indeed : ) the initial idea was a dedicated page , hence the current
confirming what that meant .
type df -h and see if you have space
that there 's side effects
ok - i 'll think about if there 's anything possible to do
do you have one ? ( matching you gmail address )
it was a nasty one
maybe , but it might , at least , break when i have to use a newer version . if
ah ok
there 's hopefully a better one though
yep ...
but at stopinstances time we have instance id and not container id
i thought i was supposed to manually disable the command ?
i had a sound issue awhile back.. i ended up tinkering in pulse audio for quite awhile . have you
dist-upgrade -d
for what i wanted to talk about yesterday i ended up sending the e-mail . essentially , it seems that
yeah , sorry . only dbarth knows why he chose the silo to be dual .
that was now a fight ...
there was quite a bit of static code fixes in one of our unity8 mps , that could actually reduce
go to keyboard shurtcut command and delete it
are you sure about /android-studiu/bin ? or is it ~/android-studio/bin ?
what ?
that it should notice it got stolen
did you auto partition in setup , or manually partition ?
nope , but should i ?
: (
i dont know how that works
i just kept pressing the volup/down as quick as i could
how long do you expect 1.9 to be supported ?
we keep the debian/* dir in the upstream lp : ecryptfs
it required me to copy in the ca chain and provide it via the cli arguments
just fyi
ok , there has n't been any activity on that bug since 3/30 .
the dvd case is irrelevant . relevant would be the output of `` cat /etc/issue '' : )
i am trying to install ubuntu via usb on a mmc next to windows 8.1. installation starts without a problem
i do n't understand you .
and wait for it to finish - it takes a few seconds to lshw
ok , what would happen if you land that without telephony-service ? just curious
mounting /dev/sda2 on /mnt failed ; invalid argument
is this something recurring , or a one off that we have shaken already ?
thats not correct at all
thought so !
so where would i begin
its not rocketscience . boot up the stick , click on the hdd in the filebrowsers sidebar , navigate to
ha . there 's no 'send ' button until that time , that 's the problem : (
maybe my syc-pipeline failed , let me check
of course , your system will not boot into gui either , so you will have to use ctl+alt+f1 to
i forgot to do that yesterday , which means trunk fails by default right now unless you do it manually
and what if the format of a getpost command ?
morning , let me take a look
this is not enough
merged
opened bug
?
use ubuntu.getseries ( name_or_version='wily ' ) etc .
same .
yeah
that 's true ; it 's because i lazily rsync it over
no , i mean they 're both mounted accounting to `mount` .
12.16
on a brand new image
well , you can try it .
ok . i checked and libwrap is in main , so it 's just an inert build-dep
if youre sure about that ( radio_unavail coming from the qmux failure ) , then i 'd look at the
i looked at that but it does not seem to
nope
i suspect it is possible , but not being able to test the brother driver myself to see how it
noooooouuuuu : ) i do not want chroot ... i want sysroot + native toolchain_s_
i also want
you should also check out cutegram
nice choice
ehh , this is all coming from our chat this morning
that method sends the ipc call to the dialer app to say is i or is not focused . there
why still ca n't help me ?
have pbuilder ?
now the question is how to proceed with that issue : )
so either refernece a different package , or include the library in your package
by default , openssh-server requests ssh keys , then will fall back to passwords if no key is offered
well , it was smaller before fwereade made a number of ( reasonable ) suggestions : )
what are the next steps to do ?
yes , go ahead
did you check the man page how it works ?
is mc midnight commander ?
tried that , the application responsible is /sbin/init ( ! ! ! ! ) and there are no zombies (
in the comment starting at line 56 in modes.go , you mention we should n't try to accept leadership if
therefore , `` security-policy '' exists for framework authors to write their own apparmor policy for their service
not a successful boot anyway .
use sudo
their timestamps only usually change if they are altered
i added a local patch to apt-mirror to disable pulling translations yesterday ; i 'm going to give it a
? ? ?
yeah ... . when i suggested those 2 i thought the mainline kernel would be more certain to solve it
btw , did you really mean to publish ubuntu-keyboard , ubuntu-system-settings to vivid in the morning ...
then enjoy it
debian bug 779559 , i cc : ed you
if you wish , but it 's just old me : - )
let 's say that there will maybe be real ubuntu tvs at some point , but the thing that you
yep
yes restart the client vm to see if it pxe boots
nope . use windows tools to create windows meida
do you have any idea where 's it 's device repo ?
flexiondotorg so i created the basic products for ubuntu mate and added links to the images . i 'll assign
dash > startup
actually if i do put the @ there it errors , ca n't find python3-ubuntu-ota-tests : armhf
try to boot the live usb and press try ubuntu and come on irc
; )
if you do n't have a quick way to fix it , i have an script to fix this quickly
are you trying to install a paid-for ubuntu 'app ' ?
quite a lot of pages were missing flickables , which will just spawn more of these bugs . : )
dunno what problem is , sddm works fine
thats not really a question for ubuntu support
went wrong after an update perhaps ?
should it matter though ? what 's the difference between nexus 4 and krillin w.r.t to the list item width
well , blackbox is not supported in here . see their support
you better check the md5sum , if provided
add this `` > foo.log 2 > & 1 ''
i hope you reinstalled
from lshw ( see daftykins above ) can you tell the name of the card ?
i 'm sorry : ( see above chat ... my calendar software decided to be stupid
sadly , the landing will have to wait a bit since we currently have no vivid silos
kdenlive gets a lot of good press , even outside of kde circles
the usb it 's ok ... worked before ?
bdmurray i have n't been able to reproduce the bug as of yet
ok it may need some loading time , watch the dvd drive light if you have one
what have you tried so far
yes ! i read it got twice as many viewers than normal at that slot
i installed libapache2-mod-wsgi - then i uninstalled it by mistake , when i try to reinstall it , it fails
what installation file ?
i dunno what you talking about
though it is a little odd that it things it 's `` windows recovery environment '' , rather than ``
how does you crontab look like ( pastebin )
brb tho
got a new error : )
also i did n't ask him about a1
k , so likely the daily build , no the retry with the fixes from this morning
which ubuntu release ?
mine has a ricoh r5c822 so we can compare to some extent
yes , these are different computers . i am transfer the files with a usb drive .
libc6 is updated version installed in the system i.e . libc6 2.15-0ubuntu10.9
i had pulseaudio - > alsa - > jack bridging activated.. for a little while
yeah , i would love to understand it though : p
i can not , trusty has never failed in ci
why 's that ?
probably related , i have n't had a chance to look
usermod -s [ shell ] [ username ]
open up a teminal and typr 'unetbootin ' ( which i 'm assuming is the binary name
hmm . fair enough
upgraded utopic- > vivid
than your a troll , take it somewhere else
no it does not and has n't since 2012
we may have urlpatterns to adjust though , i 'm still trying to find out
okay . which port should i use ?
try doing something like alt-space
^
ah , i forgot to ask : are you good to go to publish the qml/c++ tutorial or are you
hmm ... should i just manually comment to verify ?
try pressing ctrl+alt+f1 , login then type display=:0 dconf reset -f /org/compiz , then press alt+f7 to get back here
mvo : i 'm unsure to understand why you ca n't regularly land updates to wily ?
have you made the change and done a logout/login ? without accesss to the menu , thats the only way
what are the offsets there ?
ah , so everything goes to os snap ?
nah , i want random spam ... but yeah , an ad daemon could help : =
yeah but we 're not all terrorists like you
sometimes it helps to blank the first part of harddisk and create a new partition -- you know how to
you do n't think ?
unstripped binaries less huge ?
i have ran 14.04 on a 900mhz celeron with no issues
it 's under org.compiz.profiles
to check on that directory for a running kernel we usually do this : `` ls -l /lib/modules/ $ (
/etc/systemd/scripts ?
yes , by `` more complete '' i meant `` more complete than the one in the docs '' .
to test whats the problem
ok , but why is n't the `` background '' shown or only in the locked screen ?
time it takes , waste of a dvd
ah , not come across those , the one i had had no mux , but it had some outputs
so , all together , any method i do ( adding my self to wireshark group ) etc , its
fun bug , though . reminds me of how every single time we get a machine sent to us from
ca n't i just type `get me a new ip` into the console ? lol .
he struggled with mkdir commands - i do n't think this is a good approach
eliptical walking machine
if you commission the node ( even if you power it on manually ) , it should automatically configure the

lintian complains about that
did you try sudo apt -f install , after sudo dpkg -- configure -a ?
i am
neither did you answer mine , this is free volunteer help , i would lay off the attitude , you
the envar is plural ... juju_dev_feature_flags
no that i could say . just one is occasionally running otherwise all are sleeping
handy thing , is n't it .
it 's not that bazhang . i found a solution to the problem but can you explain me if you
unknown , possibly `` awe_ '' , or you , if you 're interested
for example i 'm in unity now . i run dolphin , browse the device , and gphoto2 gives ***
so in my case the fact the state in not removed is because it was added actually two times ,
and have your helper filter those ping notifications out
not that different
yeah that one
but unless you or someoene else approve my branch that is below in the stack we wo n't be able
qquickitem : can not use same item on different windows at the same time .
sure
i usually use openvpn as
i 'm from the ruhrpott . here it 's common : p
graphically ?
but we still do need it shortly , yeah
i am doing it manually , are there a log for invoke-rc.d ?
this is actually annoying because my main screen is 31 '' and notebook screen is 15,4 ''
which mail ?
other that /var/log/apt/history* ?
well , ubuntu is close to enter the chinese market , just give it more time ; )
i dont know what busybox sh does
i suppose upgrading to tusty ai n't an option ?
i expected you to see a hd1 as well , which would be the raid device .
are we sure about that ? i know i set up a procmail rule to get rid of ci-train-ppa-service spam
i live in orange county . it 's hafway between los angeles and san diego .
ok - sounds like an argument for ignoring this wrt the transition , and keep - check
have you filed a bug ?
and i 've spent few days digging the logs , there is nothing
nope .
i guess that 's true , so wgrant could turn that on any time
heh , okay , lets ask dholbach : )
well , effectively we work towards the `` your phone becomes a desktop '' vision ... so the bt kbd
it probably was you ran repairs with it on , that is an issue .
well i assume you care about your data .
did the package install successfully ?
i have -- tried replacing the 14.04 with the 14.10
also you can spawn lxc container with full init , as an upriviledged user .
that 's just making excuses
in fact if i do it like you i ca n't reproduce
beta 2
great ; - )
did it have the same behaviour when you used the opensource driver ?
lets say you create a folder in your home folder ( /home/ironhoof ) and you have a file there you
seems like i forgot to dput before holidays
wich ubuntu version and ssd brand plz ?
will make sure that migrates before i close wily . : p
32 bit wine
not as far as i can tell
will do
best practice = keep 2 kernels . new one and the previous one
we could at least maybe be kind enough to semaphore the upgrade 's occurred and not try to recover sessions
hi
3d over an ssh connection -- i guess the question is why would you need that ? that is beyond
well , also that . but vivid does n't even start up on the desktop either . it 's just
not tried tbh
have you looked at the uefi wiki , if needed ?
ubuntu 15 no longer has messages
i just talked with awe a week ago and he said from the ofono side stk should mostly work
yea , it was working before i switched a few other distros and came back to my beloved ubuntu ,
what for ?
would n't it ?
never do
ok i 'm willing to try it . but what if the screen goes blank or something ? can i
how to know that ? well i am using ubuntu 14.04
right , hmm , unfortunately i would suggest we make a gatekee . . .wait a sec got ta check
yeah . and for skylake , we absolutely had to move to wily
are you planning to learn c++ ?
i doubt that will work ; i know of no igp that can drive 3 heads simultaneously ; 2 is
good !
ok . i have no further explanation then ...
note you ca n't do this as a click either
it would be great to get some beep feedback ; ) but it 's the only thing i have right
run_on_device needs love , same as run , really ...
also try modprobe efivars from the chroot before apt-get
but i do n't remember if the munin plugin for nginx monitors bandwidth use
nice talking again -- i used to be known before as metaleer or bremsstrahlung .
but the changes wo n't effect each other
weird ways , no ; what are you running ?
while runing sudo dpkg -i *.deb
ok , will add it there
oh . so setup it 's env now .
its black on the guest account as well
i ca n't because i 'm in the middle of an install .
that i am considering . and yes if i move close to router or vice cersa the signal strength increses
you are seriously missing my joke : p
one last question , does it matter if its single or dual link ?
it 's pretty shitty though
no the rtfm
`` fixtures '' are the django was of shipping initialization data
whould i try # 12 then ?
it 's quite possible i did some time ago , i just do n't remember .
yeah
as the patch is n't in mainline yet we ca n't simply test by installing a mainline kernel , but
just to be sure , are you using dns managed by maas ? i.e . in your cluster interface ,
i really think you should reach out to the docker community for help . they can help you better than
# # hardware maybe
yes there was
no , i 'm on vivid , krillin .
name=
if you get one that definitively works , can you let me know ?
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
ogra_ , davmor2 , jibel : having issues with my google hangouts
i found why the blockdevices txns are aborting : structs are in a different order in mongo to in the
or even rsync using ssh
sure . it 's ready for your rebuild
that means we should not override the current failures but wait for more investigation , correct ?
more than happy !
the description is the human-readable entry : e.g . `` ubuntu ''
thats two clicks or you could use alt tab
so i guess the test names are fed through ci in $ test_suites build parameter ... that needs to be
nope , because someone outside of the syetm , ie as you put it , fred nextdoor will percieve space-time
what do you need persistent storage for ?
i also suggest that vm.min_free_kbytes = 242000 is enabled ( or see what it is currently set at ) ,
try mplayer2
like you booted from off to ubuntu , rebooting from other os or so
exactly what i said . take the offtopic chatter elsewhere . this is your last warning .
i 'm on vivid and i suspect that the source package should be built with the trusty chroot
autoclean looks like it did about 10meg : (

do they end with a .sh extension
in /etc/apache2.conf there is an directory entry for the folders to serve , then they are just setup normally in

quassel supports postgresql , which i wanted to use . but the charm does n't support it yet .
you do know .
just checked again to be sure , no kwin command on 15.04 , and google is not too helpful
press on the iso name inside firefox
if infinity can not help i 'm afraid it 'll have to wait for pitti
what 's the reason ?
was n't it ota7 ?
strange . you should report that as a bug against the panel , too ! just go on launchpad and
understood . but to answer the question , no it did n't work for me .
40mbyte or 40mbit ?
could we simply write an app that does that , and write an app armour profile that gives it necessary
i have a fix for the empty changelog thing that i 'll roll out shortly
what is his nick ?
ah , i see the problem - 1.22-beta3 includes my original fix for bug 1418433 which you then improved as
they are n't on ddebs - the amd64 version of 3.16.2-0ubuntu1 is missing
yw ! sorry this was such a bumpy ride ; )
whilst you 're inside fdisk it only edits its in-memory copy of the partition table ... if you do n't
oh wait , a mouse that says 1 minute left ?
you have mismatched quotes
we 'll add it when the silo is ready to land , now it 's all a bit unclear
done
yea he said i wiped windows 8 but all my partitions are still there . i 'm totally new to
which hp model is it ?
but snappy install did n't error ?
yeah the owner of the theme manager will be mhall119 . any new file that i coded , i usually
ofcourse
ok , should be fixed in some minutes
so what can i look for ? what is man in the middling me on my own network ?
that 'll be davmor2++
we are not yet in string freeze . i keep slipping the date , as it was arbitrary between peter
hmm , open pavucontrol and see to where the audio is directed .
ok cool
the ubuntu manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as surfing the web , listening to music
then ask in # # linux or wherever centos provides support .
generic-mediumtests-utopic and ubuntu-calendar-app-utopic-amd64-ci
but then again , i had to tell her how to browse windows shares as well
i did n't check the md5sum . i used the recomended program ... i forget what . mkusb or something
there are 2 package.yamls . one in overlay/meta and one in snappy-packaging/overlay/meta
yes
how can i fix that , then ?
okay i will jump there and ask !
maybe some worker / runner is hanging instead of exiting
btw , do you like your tail ?
i could not pay you , but if you could give me a hand with a project , i only
nope..
damn , sorry
works here
ah very well . glad you got it sorted out : )
i mean gui
false .
its in the trusty-backports repo for 14.04
as in top level without adding the subchan
i can not tell the future ( yet ) : p
you took done that one link i had
panel > add new items > notification area
vmware
sorry i have n't worked with bundles.yaml or those ci tests yet
still this ? lp : ~ci-train-bot/unity8/unity8-ubuntu-xenial-landing-022
nouveau or propretary ? it works fine with nouveau ( most of the time )
yes , to pass the censorship
arges may be helpful : - )
he left
i worked but i still have a problem with disk space ... it removed libqt4-webkit : i386
my last branch failed because of this error :
it is not in the list of processes , i only see hv_vmbus_con hv_vmbus_ctl
there is a big difference .
i 'll plan on back porting that next here
it will be soon , i rebuild bumped the missing bits
details ?
i see , will commit a fix soon
its desktop dell optiplex 7010
: - )
i do
k : ) lots of smart people frequent here though .
got it
apt-get update & & apt-get upgrade
you could create a new user and see if it suffers of the same problem .
then have a seperate partition , for your windows storage
that 's a good question ! will do asap
done
yuk ! not real sure what to make of that . the status is 'rc ' - > ( r
haha
if you want more stable use 14.04.2
if there an additional drivers ?
or use another program . what are you monitoring ?
just seen sarahs mail : )
yet you do n't say why
any ideas when mate ?
yes ? where is it not using us servers ?
and a third that has windows on it
take a look at node-snapper ...
so is the router sending on a frequency the old wifi card doesnt work with ? please make sure tha
are you interested in app development ?
^
yeah , it 's impressive is n't it
if i am correct the difference between my time zone and his is 9 hours , so work is harder
yup , i 'm there
i could n't manage an entire company !
well , the thing is that it should be already sorted automatically
my build fails though
i had this bug and could fix like this , weirdo ... right ?
which ubuntu version do you have ?
done
no idea , i personnal do n't want it , but feel free to update/find a sponsor if you think
the ubuntu-settings-components is just a fix for text alignment . since it 's a bit screwed when things get translated
it looks like 0.4 had a negative auto-review
this is windows , right ?
install 14.04 , check bios , check ram , try no_acpi boot
more stable , longer support term
the version of openssh in ubuntu 14.04 is `` openssh_6.6.1 , openssl 1.0.1f 6 jan 2014 '' ... your client
any time
cleared after reboot : )
left edge drag on the device
it 's actually 4+4 no ? 4 big 4 small
you dont even have to ask if you can ask.. you just ask , and if a volunteer can assist
ok like what ?
sure , but it 's there already
o/
what/how exactly should i debug ?
so please do n't torture me ; d
not like that ...
it is a man power issue - we had several high priority mirs that trumped many others this cycle
will do . i have a feeling this is also related to somethnig that is happening to a few games
yeah , talk to alexisb
send your cv in anyway , you might be pleasantly surprised : -p
ok ... what usually happens when you install from a pseudo-dvd image is it adds a cdrom entry in /etc/apt/sources.list
yep , that is better now .
well i guess snappy needs a way to handle any messy u-boot and kernel : )
4h30 is with shitty airlines
it gets remounted as ro if there are some errors . so see the logs
welcome to the community
can you confirm if the patch would obviously apply to a 1.20 branch ?
noted . can you raise a barajas bug - probably a one-off , but worth checking
does n't sound like its worth the time . nevermind .
that 's the same as me on krillin
i know rafael has a had a play , paypal can api neatly into the bank account .
of course : - )
which user was failing to create ?
hey , is there anything you think you can break off of what you are doing or should i look
er , sorry , wrong silo-015 card . : )
encfs
i understand . please let me know anytime and happy to talk through . the team is going to work
were you here for the 347616 line paste ?
haswell is 64bits
it does n't show up as a network device so i may be missing some firmware or something
does windows 10 currently take up all of your only disk ?
are you behind some firewall that blocks ntp ?
> > package 'libc6-dev-i386 ' is not installed , so not removed
there 's nobody now .
# kubuntu might help
yes ... . but wait for less traumatic solution : - )
we 'll sync with you on monday , nothing vital for today anymore
ssh ?
it might just be that your router does n't work well if you try to connect to your external ip
ok , type sudo apt-get install smartmontools & & sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | nc termbin.com 9999
for you also driver manager kcm does not list any versions now ?
and just for chagrins , what is the output of : sudo updatedb & & locate intrinsic.h
according to this document , the mini 210 has an intel gma3150 video chipset . that should help us further
is there also a fix for the indicator-location crash under unity 7 ?
do n't be sorry that 's a good thing !
what is the issue ?
i disagree with how you are describing the situation , and for good measure , i asked on windows ,
i dont think microsoft makes a product that installs the windows os that can be ran from the linux desktop..
rofl
given that i 'm the one that uploaded it , i can confirm that with 100 % accuracy . the
so create them using mkdir .
so you reinstalled libgphoto2-2 ?
i 'll rearrange them and see what happens
yeah , we tracked it down . it will be fixed in tomorrow 's image
what can you read about the `` background '' in the manual . it is wrong !
it may be caused by a corrupted image when written to the usb
and it was josh arenson not chris gagnon
pong
yes , that 's what i did . took one of those win7 isos and some tool that puts it
\o/
that would be great .
awooga , what updated yesterday ?
you should talk to your university
i know .
dns resolution
is that the german version of 9gag ?
its atom cpu is really really really slow
looks liek a bug to me
already been used : )
yeah , it 's one of the cases we should support well - for density
i 'm not spotting anything here , either : / ; it all looks normal enough..
ah , yes i used to do a lot of that before uvtools . still do for some debian makedumpfile
do n't worry about it , i 'm on it already - will file a bug
yeah probably best , i agree it should n't really get into a state where the only way out is
when i touch the case i feel like being effected by electricity but it 's been like that for a
citrain device-upgrade 022 0000
for rpi2 ?
though , its likely flash in firefox.. if that is running..
certainly
so the snappy change is merged , i triggered a ppa build , once that is in the ppa we
i found before that without proper grahics drivers it can seem a bit slow
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
in two places in the same method .
done . i 've also made you an admin , so you should be able to approve new editors
sure it is .
please tell me how to add android emuletor
( and deployed on germanium )
right ! not the error , which i guess i 'll do now
updating ?
obviously if they 've been in the california sun and gotten a tan .
no need
try `` power save '' option in the file menu
yup !
good to go ?
thats the eventual plan , currently they 're only available as preinstalled debs though
it 's kde/plasma that he does n't care about
also , i 've been using zfs for 6+ years ; )
for example rofi , i3 ,
dunno , i do run marble , but i 'm on 12.04 , runs fine here , dunno on 14.04
we dont have per-user packages anymore
will that change to utopic or reinstall the entire system ?
but says the ioctls are unsupported
oh , i am good , considering . got to rebuild the starter on my ole pickup , and procrastinating
ok you got rtm 3
should i use kubuntu 16.04 daily build because once the current build was buggy
working on that , sorry
can you guide me step by step ? i 'm in advanced mode now
-- > pm
strange that touchpad is not recognized .
no , apparently toykeeper is n't equipped to qa it .
do you even read ?
what part ?
dpkg-buiildpackage only builds srcpkgs , as doesnthe archive
build what ? the package from the archive ?
ah you want them to work on it too..
i typed `` ! ops '' in # ubuntu . one user by name of stenchfoodtz pmed me and typed
patch snapcraft to use sudo there
are you from the uk ?
i guess its trial and error to know if hibernate is supported on my laptop . and if so i
so , if you are uploading to the store , that means that snappy has enough implemented to install it
done . what would the next step be if the tearing is still present ? ( it is . )
check the makefile . it may use extra_cflags . in which case , use `` make extra_cflags=-fpic ''
i was trying to work out how to add darkxst - but i was struggling with permissions . and now
neat
you have the patch ?
ahah , nice : p
two distos ?
that looks ok , so
it does n't open anything
doh of course : d
ah okay then
21h34
could it be as simple as the display being on the wrong input ?
it seems sergiusens forgot to include you
i did
what says the result of : cat /etc/issue
so 1448308 will be closed only as soon as we resolve the issue ( and not when the skip-the-test patch
yeah , well , that what happened . i was in bed or something and it twisted itself upwards
that might sound weird , but mind to take the issue in the meantime or assign it ? ; -
well ... is n't this still doing the right thing though ? are n't we saying `` this is juju
ok , so you manually edit the xubuntu conf .
no , only kate , kile , kde im client , amarok -think my others are all non kde programs
you should do that from the single user mode
and that also only happens when using specific compiz plugins , like `` grid ''
what filesystem are you using on /tmp ?
execute this command :
i would make the gray bg very light
yes format
get off irc
i prepared updated packages of lttng-modules-dkms for trusty and vivid that build with all current kernels but i had to
it doesnt matter if you have it enabled or not , if you read the bug
so for some reason fsck gets started twice ?
sure
it seems to fake it up with just one area and move windows around
very much looking forward to the html5 guide !
sorry , i do not understand `` foss '' , what does that mean ?
reinstall grub2 to the ssd
laggy irc
ugh .
check again please ?
itr does because the newer versions have switched to sddm from lightdm and kdm
'murica sounds great ... and nintendo and sony say that its to difficult to bring out tv stuff in the
oh , excellent , i was going to ask about that ; - )
bzr upgrade
of course i 'm sure you can wire it up to a pi , provide a json basd rpc system
well that sounds terribly inefficient
i am past my patience level , it is not you but me , ; ) read this when you
that 's why i 'm asking .
can i write some tests for you to get the branch landed earlier : ) i 'm really keen (
unit193 is n't your real name ? : o
keep in mind that 14.04.3 lts might work more stable for you
that is the .xsession-errors file ? never seen anything like it . also what release is this ?
certainly not an installer bug if something you install after the fact is removing linux-generic , but would still be
the stuff on their site does n't seem relevant to the mail server security issues though
and try again
hey , look master is cursed due to the race build
i use liveusb on a daily basis .
np
also : which windows version are you using ?
oh ok. then start a terminal and see who the owner of that file is
would also expose config to set ip address to use
one for cwayne when he gets up then
it was me just not having read a bug you reported in full , now i have : )
nps , i expect it 'll be exactly the same given the size : ) just merge if so
any idea what could i do ?
good good
ok ... wily wo n't work
no , i wans n't working on it.. it was ready to publish to me
sudo lshw -c video
sniffs like rmq
i did all of those before , now when i type on the terminal hostname it 's showing www.example.com
sorry you 're not running a supported kernel .
i did n't say anything about popularity , i said the client is ancient
i did
so he is right ?
with gparted , i mean
if only this initial ubuntu user would have a password to login *sigh*
which is why what we can do in the mean-time is consolidate everything possible into the bug report
try without the armhf
as in -- bootstrap will wipe all data ...
you dont need ifconfig to get the ip .
erm ... does it affect us throught the store too ?
you might try `` setsid unity '' , but it will basically reset your unity session .
usually i use sudo apt-get install -y samba samba-common python-glade2 system-config-samba
well , what is set for the nameserver to get dhcp ' cat /etc/resolv.conf ' . and is the symlink
or is this a race condition on the kernel level ?
can do , added to my stack . should be unwinding it shortly
i tried it before . it did n't seem to help .
security updates tend to be released as soon as they are ready
# xfce-dev
the jenkins jobs ? that 's indeed bad
what 's the normal timeout ?
then give the commands for showing broken packages !
or any hope for touch devices with free driver stacks . : p
on it
if i call it in the mousearea , the value becomes correct . what is the issue here ?
oh of course i had forgotten about mir
should have edit permissions now
what repos is this package coming from
lv snapshots is how decent linux systems provide an easy roll-back facility for upgrades and the like
no , you said `` it remove xserver ''
i 'm considering adding a step after .pot update in the train
sudo apt-get install -- install-recommends linux-generic-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-core-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-video-all-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-input-all-lts-vivid libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-vivid
the equivalent of 238.209.58.216.in-addr.arpa mapping to 216.58.209.238
anyways i 'm happy to give you some more time ; i understand your busy so just let me know
top-right
we should really not add any more features to the spreadsheet , it will make it harder to go away
what is what displays where ?
it is . and with the flag stuff , uros pointed me at that code , it 's straight from
i was watching a video it stopped streaming but instead of turning off and on i just held out and
no , you can edit the install-medias grub menu
hey saves him having to remember the numbers walk out and post them from there : )
ok
should work with prime + binary
that sounds good
anyhow i have seen commercial storate systems with hundreds of identical drives with virtually consecutive serial numbers ...
and the same applies to line 245 in allocateto - check i.state ( ) ! = addressstateunknown instead
i have read that , this is different . i do n't get the motd
quite right
you might have to add the modes
`` buteo '' is not really an expressive/nice name btw , but i guess that 's not going to change
apt has a history log .
lovely ; heh
what about me ?
btw are you running a webserver yet ?
so we call this standard edition ubuntu desktop ?
are there any ubuntu-level libs required ?
do you see the old ip with juju status ?
right , i refreshed and now nothing
i do use the adt image for a lot of stuff , but for testing systemd uploads or things like
# ubuntu-app-devel might be a better place to ask about app dev questions
i 've got a ppa build of 2.2 so i do n't *expect* any blockers
it needs to have a gui
?
for an example of unit-ish tests see apiserver/backups and api/backups
yeah thats wrong , should be syslog : adm
interesting ... photo ?
test them out wicj one has best performance
i would wait for better help . ; )
omg weired : p
the build already happened a bit earlier .
there we go .
okay , i wo n't . but is that why i see those errors ? : /
as we initially landed this change in the vivid overlay ppa , we did n't realize the dependency was not
so you ca n't get to that personal information without the key to the box . what you see when
probably ... i started using it where possible in weather during my commits
now the internal sound card says `` front , center '' in noncaptivating tone.. but this is progress
`` firefox is already running , but is not responding . to open a new window , you must first

eta ?
that givess no output too
because the os is on /writable
first , i 'd press command key + search `` display ''
hmm , good question , might cause some problems
is it the weird path to the desktop file ?
no add a caption at the bottom `` minimal '' or some such ...
shame on you
they never answer there
yep , what remains now ?
and point1 : i am able to ping the 198.20.90.115 from outside . but from 115 to 114 or any
did you reboot the pc since we last talked ?
no ppa
at least that 's only in the tests and easily changed
could it be that mir is not receiving the hint for some reason , and refuses the app ?
sudo apt install pastebinit
then i tried bumblebee again after failing for a while and it said `` no nvidia card detected ''
maybe a video driver issue
! e-d-s always has soname bumps , many even !
nettop , maybe
i would check that , without a ssd you are stopped dead at times .
sudo apt-get install wine1.6 ?
the fans 100 % , the led lights blinking , and finally the system shutdowns
it finds all files in your home dir that are n't owned by you
ok
i 'm not an android dev so i ca n't say that with any authority . how about yourself ?
are you joining the rtm meeting ?
configure the server to listen on port 443
what is the issue of your screen resolution ?
the libraries and tools needed are the same .
then you can extract the .gresource files and edit individual colors or just load folder packs
great !
always happy to do it : )
tail -f /var/log/syslog from terminal and plugin your sd plz
this is on the desktop with a single gpu
the commit you reference in that bug has been in the utopic kernel since the first 3.16.0-22.29 ( and earlier
corruption mentioned ?
yes , just take the command part from your cronline , and run it

e17 ( enlightment ) is also cool
hm , wait
ok , so gnome-network-manager should manage all this
so i am in the `` edit '' area of live booot
great , it will be even better if you manage to add a test that confirms the proxy settings are
no .
i tihnk that was before apw fixed how he published them .
you are a user . you are not all users .
what about using manual
just leave it in for now
either ship a source_ < srcpkgname > .py which applies to all binaries , or a < binarypkg > .py
no limits there , whatever we feel is the best place for it
fresh installs are usually better
only way to test the scope interaction with the browser : p
cinnamon ( the mint thingy ) is a shell for gnome3 too .
yeah , i read your e-mail , it sounds good
yeah , try sudo apt-get purge ubuntu-desktop
something is very wrong
yes
my understanding is that once the instance is set up ( right after provisioning ) , we do n't do
there 's going to be at least 1 more rebuild from what i can tell - to remove wubi finally
yea you can try that probably run ./alsamixer while in /usr/bin but typically /usr/bin is set in your path so
okay .
i 'm trying to avoid recommending you reboot again since it takes so long
no dice . it says press any key to continue . and it goes back to the selection screen .
`` juju-not-available '' ?
in those cases it 's normal that it takes > 10s for the screen to turn on and then that

they were directed there and ignored it . i tried to help but then they went on to insult me

no , sorry
i appreciate your help
now that you have tested , as i stated before , you can easily delete the new ones , and
it keeps coming back even after i finish it
what kind of machine is this ?
sudo grub-install -- root-directory=/ /dev/sda
sorry
wait , does it asks you to authorize a service , or to enter your credentials ?
i guess the question would be how could we get more people checking them ?
you mean it is possible that i might get lost in a dark world again ? ?
i would guess that too
since few days my gtk-window-decorator is n't working , then my windows is without decoration
i feel in my guts it have to do with chaching
all from silo5
then run `` cd /home/kat/downloads '' ... now `` chmod +x linux-brprinter-installer-2.0.0-1 '' and now `` ./linux-brprinter-installer-2.0.0-1 ''

any news on that topic ?
well , you have to understand the user concept .
ok
which bug ? on my desktop ( trusty ) the unit tests on master and the rebased maas-spaces branch are
please do `` sudo mount -o remount , rw / ; sudo /usr/bin/apt update ; sudo /usr/bin/apt install ubuntu-snappy ;
still waiting on that command 's result
ahhh osrry , done that , ran the command but it did not work
so i can just remove the dmesg checking ... but the biggest issue is that vm detection is just spotty..
i wish it were simpler : -/
try to see your sources , to see if any ppa slipped in
i would also be ok with capping the amount of history if we are worried about it
ah . crypttab is empty . maybe that is the reason
so you have a `` dumb '' user account on everyday and have the admin mode if you use sudo
oh.. i have no idea how to do that
no , i 'm asking if it 's worth it - there 's 3 new features in ntinx 1.9.4
okay so you have the old library .
i was more referring to files
oh ... looks like i could remove the gnome-core package and only install gnome-session-flashback
if resolvconf is removed , you edit the file directly
lxde upstream tracker not recognized on lp ?
what 's up doc ?
i see . sorry if these are stupid questions .
i work with everything .
yes , i just left it in the case where the operation had either failed or succeeded
getting fixes into the archive requires the ci-train and that can sometimes take a while to get done .
ahhhh windows would be a horrible option for me .
no
can you explain in full in one sentence maybe instead of bits and pieces ?
would be interesting to know if we can download these firmware on usb , to install on offline boxes

the ppa seems to fix the problem ! : )

i 'll let you know later after installing filters silo again ( currently investigating something else )
ca n't you add yourself ?
`` in a couple of weeks '' according to the developers
i wonder why your system doesnt find the kernel package , says it is 14.04 but the sources point to
i do n't think i 've ever not wanted to update testing deps too
so the .a files contained in the program are the same as the .lib files on windows ?
the command lists every peripheral connected to the computer
lol
maybe i will give them a try .
because there wo n't be a pre-existing space , so we 'll create the necessary infrastructure at bootstrap
can you revert silo 35 ?
there is ddrescue and dd_rescue iirc

did that involve adding some headers per chance ?

i am wondering about that failure ... 1.2 was available already in vivid ...
eh i had n't been using gnome 2 in a while so was just a new thing to me
there is , i did n't clean those up either in the 500-.*kernel . * task

done , : )
same 155 ms on the tablet ...
ah , ok
misunderstanding of my wording
removed docker.io cgroup-lite apparmor

what choises do you have there ?
we had to add api later due to some unplanned features ...
i mean , it 's not absurd
have you signed up on launchpad yet ?
in any case , my root partition is perfectly fine ... . i can boot it using the rescue kernel

you can top approve it then , as he 's already approved

we will need a struct based thing then type opt struct { name , longdescription , shortdescription string , target
yeah , uh , that was me doing things perhaps out of sequence .
you ca n't do anything in that case
that all is not in the focus of this channel .
lol : )
is it locking up completely ?
yeah , also tried grub-imageboot
the correct place ; but possibly no-one around right now that knows the answer .
they just banned me for talking about it , lots of chromium fan boys in there

too big or too small ?
hmmmmmmm if that not in there already ?
maybe your gpu fan is full of dust , that could explain this behaviour too .

it should be . are you sure you dd to the whole drive and not to a partition ?
looks like you 're the only one playing it tho , according to download stats : d
which for upstart launched applications would have to be in upstarts environment ( initctl set-env )
slightly less typing ; )
we need your expertise ( and perms ) to do the rebase of maas-spaces : )
install . images build fine
well , bad news is , i am currently debugging a ftbfs in nginx on my sbuild instance , trying
description : ubuntu 14.04.1 lts
re that fix
2 sims ( 1 per slot ) both locked with a 4 digit pin code
ok
why not try both ?
if that earned you a cuppa ... yes
yeop
and is there a project/source package i can target the bug at , for reference ?
just kicked it off
that would be a long long way > 12.10 - 13.04 - 13.10 - 14.04 lts ...
no
: )
yes
or do the lspci .
you 're good to go , then . good luck , and as always : have a reliable backup handy
i dunno what you mean with last , it could be last one in tursty , ( 1.7 ) ,
working here got a phone access point show up on laptop
ok then first try that no_acpi boot on lubuntu first
you can dget the dsc
i ca n't afford it as it 's live server
i used remote scopes like 10 seconds ago
( to answer your other question : no my sight is fine )
btw when i turn it on and off , the numpad works like usual ,
that might be testscenarios or testscenarios + django-testscenarios
i rebuilt it to add ext4 commands
could you shot me the link to the developer.ubuntu launchpad page so i can request a feature ?
which uses your users environment
nice catch , i am going blind .
true..i will fix the highlight color in podbird
but then that 's not the default , right ? they 've set constraints ?
who actually works on it ?
ca n't rule it out , unless i try in windows perhaps
i have n't run those two branches at the same time .
well , when i try to run something it says 'module `` qtquick '' version 2.3 is not installed '
you can go about this two ways . 1 , check the supported resolutions , or 2 , set it
let me try : - )
it is the start : d
what makes you mention debian ?
also you show the config but what error ? if it 's some net issue , then eth0 or eth1
any luck ?
support queries only in future
question : how can an ubuntu package update released on the 12th include fixes from three days into the future
do you want people to help with moving processes ?
everything ok ?
ok , that explains everything then . we should be able to just add an entry for it manually then
will i still be tracked by unity if i install an alternate de ?
yeah good to get your bearings before doing something like that
just letting you know since there is a freeze going on
apt-cache policy maas
if you do alternate boot , then it 's a simple grub-install
please provide the other options that best suite for windows
there are roughly two million guides online , look it up .
but without using the snappy initrd you wont get the snappy filesystem setup at all
if zixxorb can also boot his current laptop with the cd , we can be sure the image is n't
recommending posteo.de even if they cost a euro per month .
i hope so ... .
the best way imho is with ssh
which ubuntu are you using ?
err , i started it , there is an issue that needs fixed , just sorting it out now (
most of 'em are at something like utc-5 though
well adding ppa 's that wont work
you are likely being avoided due to your poor english .
the tools block it , right ?
nope , i am not trolling , i really hate switching to windows
well , it 's just information right now , because i 've already had fde for weeks . just interesting
what account type option is that using ? `` other account '' ? ? it ca n't not expand ,
go ahead : )
< ogra_ > 4196 ? r 28:56 /usr/bin/python /srv/system-image.ubuntu.com/bin/import-images
sed -i 's/^error_reporting/error_reporting = e_all etc/ ' /tmp/php.ini
look into 'man interfaces '
nah , not necessary
no , it was successfully copied over
did you install ubuntu with cable and updates on ?
what 's our process , do you think it 's a specific test ?
i just booted with an older version of the kernel and everything looks good o_o
backports to what ?
weird , i just accessed it
but that will stay on the 3.13 or 13.19 kernel path you are already on .
no
no you do n't plant grass you lay it on top
what does this report ? `` grep dmi /var/log/dmesg ''
i have several containers ( including this irc ) running on that so switching takes some time : )
yes , the fix in trunk will now just log an error , and do n't produce a `` follow
and even that is controlled under the hood by parent being disabled : )
per vps or at ubuntu ?
i tried u-d-f ( and u-snappy-cli ) from vivid , and that fails too
at last ! : )
did you install the vivado suite thing ?
alesage : i 'm now inclined to let adt-run fail when we specify non-existing tests , instead of catching the
we do
so what is the exact issue right now ?
ok , great , press c over the main dir , it should recover everything
you 're not supposed to in the outer root
uefi is pretty nice once you get used to it .
confirm `` /etc/network/interfaces // line 2 - auto lo - ; line 3 - iface lo inet loopback - //
this _is_ a different system trusty is desktop and vivid is macbook air
so i should post this elsewhere ?
yes . it 's not the only way to go about it . it is certainly the preferred approach though
just go in to printer configuration and add printer , - all modern printers can talk cpl
your question boils down to `` how to i set an administrative password without the password to an administrative account
oops , meant to post there
nice
no read limits , there are re-write limits though , but it is into the hundreds of thousands writes to
^
there was one other comment about adding the timeout parameter for apply_update ( ) method
oh , heh , i see
you had left earlier just before i had a recommendetion ... i will repost it
nah you did 12.04 - > 14.04 , a perfect jump , lts to lts
ok , i am going to see if i can borrow a laptop , boot into live usb , and
is there *any* device listed that has a number 3 on the end ?
i also noticed the bluetooth device firmware is n't being found/loaded ; so bluetooth may not work until you resolve
can you ping 198.20.108.114 ?
as i did n't get the notification , i stopped to ask whether that was expected or not
modprobe : fatal : module zswap not found .
it looks that way ... v4 needs a timestamp
or try the previous kernel thing
i 'd say so . it 's nice that my motherboard actually comprehends booting to different operating systems rather than
so , can we set a new trunk now ? : )
should be working out of the box right
so i can have one nic on one switch and the other nic on the other switch : d
modify the script
so am i. it was hard enough getting to the point where companies actually have their proprietary games ported to
so yeah , that 's not unity-scope-home
maybe need it for sure once they go multi-user , and she was thinking down that road , but i
my guess would be a pdf file so large , will always be long manual work to edit
fancy doing the patches in a proper way ?
ahhh ! but the failure could be from reading the installer device . are you using a usb or dvd
even if i make a change , the translation team might take days to aprove myc hanges
yeah , sounds sensible
yeah , 14 free right now .
so in the train we implemented a hook that allows you to rewrite your debian/control as appropriate for the release
well , i just notice that many config files have this so you save the admin from having to read
u did..i cross-checked and it seems clock does the same as well
i filed out the form dully and to the best of my knowledge , all build correctly , and e.g
ok
hmm . got ta say it 's a bit out of my wheelhouse at that point , and i 've
there is just windows on ssd . is it a right way ?
i did
think so
can you give us a clue about what you 're trying to do ?
can you tell me when you ran into this issue ?
i 'm rewritting it to use epoll , almost done , but there is still this libplymouth thingy
maybe check top/htop for what 's using resources ?
why are n't you already ?
finding the same with clean config fwiw
if it was working and then stopped it is possible it 's a hardware problem , but it 's also
service does n't call into client , client calls into service
cool : )
it fails
oh that 'll be tight but doable
i was able to create a bootable ubuntu usb using a windows system a long time ago , i would

i should mention i am now in ubuntu 14.10 live usb
yeah . i mean , fundamentally , it 's an apt bug , but dependency loops end up being an
i am on installed ubuntu : d
i 've got a tech debt card for that
so you can ssh in but ca n't screw around without the code
lol well they said i come here
the prob is that openjdk is afaik super nasty to build
so if you have time , wait the needed 2-3h still and then manipulate that single symbol only adding !
yes , but the noop-mode of dda
there is no exfat option
trouble sleeping ...
well as this an ubuntu support channel , you should n't expect any responses
websockets and the rest of the snappy vision
yeah , friday , going out for some errands and having lunch with friends
remind me , what was it about ?
: )
the oauth token
you can install without it , but the packages ca n't be verified
unsure , but dkms seems likely
has this card ever worked ?
they suggested me to drive 10.000km to learn
again trying to fight network manager is a bad idea
let me know how it goes
and if the primary interface is `` eth0 '' then some of the sed manipulations that change `` eth0 ''
it 's the same as dd onto it
is kde stable ?
the nice thing is that qmlapicheck does the job for me now ; )
oh oops : ( sorry natefinch
i am surprised . i just saw that
so , i rebuild that on the silo , right ?
yea
ki7mt : that last answer didnt work , but the /usr/lib/nvidia-349 has the lib there . : s
it needs to be regenerated
well , it 's the first contribution . i found it annoying that the `` build translations '' menu entry
the last windows server i used was nt 4.0 . it bluescreened every thursday and we never figured out why
there 's the current queue to clean up , and then it should be pretty light touch , until it
yeah , that means it 's a mounted filesystem
so it 's either not finding the binary , or the binary is needing libraries that it is n't finding
sounds good
it is a production server
why do n't you just say what happens
its a standard intel chipset . nuc i5
you have a bad drive
so you retired the armhf one specifically already ? or should i do something in the interface ?
hopefully .
and , looking at the .install file , it sure seems to be missing .
before all that do this : lsb_release -a | nc termbin.com 9999 and paste the url here .
do you know exactly when the crash happened ?
i dont know if or where vmware ships drivers like vbox does
no , ftp is a really bad idea . are you trying to share hosting with other people ?
sidenote , but , when in xorg , you can mouse drag to resize multi-windows .
great - i 'll dig those out for you
paste the line you added to fstab here
can you clear ~/.cache/upstart/* , try again and see what you find there
mine is a bit old at this point too ... maybe i should do that
that 's what locate |grep says , too
both are same
cant acknowledge that
no hurry at all
if you are already doing it please add `` apt-cache policy libc6 libc6-dev ''
without modification
i can see if i can take a look at it today
sorry maybe not very clear : i tryied goanysync and cachefilesd as caching method but nothing changed , from ubuntu
like a `` normal '' person ; - ) lol
btw , add please 's and sorry 's wherever it might apply , i am not being impolite , my
so building and installing the package from that branch does n't work ?
no food either tonight ?
what is ?
no you ca n't run two oss at once on the same hardware , your only choice is something like
then nvidia-settings should be your first stop
regarding my osk mp , i made those review updates . i 've been running app tests , they seem
ok .
yeah , that 's a curious case -- must be the only upstart-only package in debian : )
there is no docker job in /etc
will it mess up my hard disk ?
for lts releases that need more recent kernels you should use the supported hardware enablement packages
we need a bug that 's not fix committed
i had tried that , but it wanted me to activate a repo on my system .
can i generate a new one , or recover it ? ( since i deleted it only a few minutes
it 's easier to get around if you are not on the ground
jjohansen may be able to make that recommendation , but waiting for ogra_ for how to port for snappy specifically
oh ? is n't that just 1.5 hours or so ?
so what might be the most sensible approach for the provider to manually set these things
what version of juju ?
if you go into your systems bios/efi setup , you might be able to set the boot device to be
oh
yes
yeah ; to use virt-manager , you 'll use ssh -x when connecting to it..
why post the driver then in the first place ?
?
i was rather unclear . is it safe from cracking ?
indeed.. argh.. i missed that bit
it is fixed , 'cos i fixed it : ) forgot to mention that in the commit message ...
right . ubuntu wiki type seems to be the standard
the problem is probably you did n't choose the proper key when you created your instance
are you sure - the lenovo 's normally have a switch in the bios for that
no , if it 's in , it 's in
okies . will keep digging
for logs look at /home/ $ user/.xsession-errors
hmmm how fast is the cpu on the desktop one ?
as well as i did update-grub , update-initramfs -u and grub-install /dev/sda
actually writing on /sys/power/state works
ack ; rt opened .
weird . no idea . what happens if you < gulp > manually reboot it ?
if the user would be exploited i would have some files with root only write access
well , then , can anyone help me resurrect pulseaudio daemon ?
it was not a bug for me
ship it
can you please be a bit more precise ? : )
the emulator should at your disposal
is this on personal ?
even preview of the website points to landing page
yeah one by one , be careful is all .
sorry . `` new '' .
i 'd bet they ditched firewire when we did
sounds good
i hope to finish a new image today and will make that clearer ( calling it dummy @ dummy or
there are test cases for the path @ rev syntax using both a sha and a tag : /
ok , got checkbox now
probably because the os has n't been designed to mind-read
so yes that check should be changed , feel free to do that as part of your branch
i did
no updates for 2 years = abandonware in my opinion
should i create a truetype directory in my ~/.fonts directory like in /usr/share/fonts/truetype ? ?
weird . the u1 account should only be removed if the credentials are no longer valid ; i find it
there is # pulseaudio for specific ones , but ubuntu related : sure
ah , so it was audio roles only , ok .
no x auto detects at boot these days
whats the correct way to load module using modprobe ?
if you plug a samsung ssd into your pc , bios has te be changed from ide to ahci
you 're running dangerously close from -19481419 .
and one_vcs does n't check that the vcs is consistent .
what are you talking about
thats not how irc works
packages in ubuntu may not be the latest . ubuntu aims for stability , so `` latest '' may not
i still dont know what setup you use and what the real issue is
there was work done , but then dednick had holidays . he 's back now !

i agree it would be best to avoid no delta , but if it ends up being a necessary evil

i may have spoken too soon i was able to reproduce . deploying the gui now
just install chromr if you do n't worry about none open source
are those checks triggered manually , or are they autoamtic ?
armhf definitely got past that point
do you remember which version you upgraded to ? r20 ? r21 ?
i 'm pretty sure you can get a raspbery pi 2 for that price
initially ? or was that because of the aa-exec error ?

i wrote a blog post ~2 years ago when i switched from screen - > tmux ... it might inspire
ok , then see if you can reproduce the problem with gnome disk utility again . also make sure that

db.changeversion ( '' , 'foo ' ... ) seems to be used to initialize the db

ok ; )
gnome terminal has some other issues related to positioning too
so it would n't build ?
for example x-terminal-emulator -e sh -c 'echo hello & & sleep 5 ' will work

need help or is it sorted ?

that was a long standup !
try gksudo nautilus to see if you can read/write
how to interrupt the test ?
it lists the disks and partitions
that is very cool

right , with today 's daily
yeah thats my issue on n4
nothing jumps out at me , any ideas or should i 'adb reboot ' it ?
you did the right thing : )
that 's what caused the kernel-bug in the movie .
it shows after the driver=
no , just weird bugs that come up
small internet : p
make sure its for 12.04 right
put the code in there and save and see what it does
i did n't quite follow you there
let us continue it tomorrow
no . 14.04 is lts , which means 5 years support . the next lts is 16.04 .
building drivers and stuff , not so easy , and probably have to redo it each kernel update
first check your boot media : md5sum the .iso then the usb you made with it .
was typing it to see what it said
did you test this on lts ?
that 's a good question . i do n't think there is a way - popey ?
good to hear .
anyway , your grub does n't have a listing for windows
hmm that makes no sense when blkid shows is a partition uuid
sudo umount /usr/share/powerd/device_configs/config-default.xml ... then try installing it again
did you say the desktop 'tears ' as well as when playing videos ?
mirv is the keeper of qt ppas
clonzilla for copying partitions asks to which partition to copy to

seems about the same to me
the substantial change is the transaction is completely different - and it 's now done on address setting not on

this is what i see , it seems like there is one additional byte in yours
the one on your computer may have ubuntu specific info . it is good to use the ubuntu specific info
did you somehow modified the pastebin ?
looks like /etc/systemd/system.conf can configure the default , and that systemd uses the kernel default by default .

yes
yeah that 's the other thing , you need debian/ in trunk
it refers to 31.7mb at one stage in the update on mine , but at the end it actually says

or install strace/gdb etc
wait for the winehq people
so for the moment serpent seems to do the job quicker ( for me )
can you be more specific than 'does not work ' ?
he 's not , but it 'll work .

i use laravel , should i use 127.0.0.1 or localhost ?
ah k lem me do that rq

no they dont . everything was normal before . i could read and write , and mount the drives on

yeah i know , but it was free : )
i kinda like lint first , but not having to remember to update the script is more important
i 'll do it , jdstrand just gave me the regex ; - )
there are still , just for some reason you are an awkward user who refuses to follow provided advice .
nope
did you reboot
i always forget the url to that page .
those tests all pass as well : d
good , that means they are installed . try `` dig www.google.com @ 10.0.0.34 ''
ok will find it
there is no proper process yet ... /var/lib/extrausers/ has the user data though

has anyone ever tried to install ubuntu on a dell precision tower 7910 ? elaborate enough ?
default you have one layout installed , what you selected when you installed it .
shift+ctrl+c is copy , shift+ctrl+v is paste
hmm ... what type of machine are you testing it in ? can you read the label ? : p
where i can find it ? how can i launch it ?
i feel like that ought to be a self-healing problem
why can i report plasma bugs ?
ask on # ubuntu-devel
`ubuntu-device-flash -- clean-cache touch` ftw
should we be concerned about the fcitx cpu bug ?
looks like it exploded pretty bad
is there some command to print out the list in terminal ?
let me know if the staging britney is causing issues , it will trigger every 15 minutes , i can
( i know about this part )
can you join plasma ?
welcome to systemd madness ; p
well i guess you ca n't sudo , so 'passwd -l root ' from recovery
try setting your password to something numeric
stop all kvms
it 's still a valid bug though
oh
the root terminal on `` recovery '' is just a terminal . just be careful what you do . presntly
also , could you share the notes that you 've taken ( re : your tips and tricks ) would

they sound like the options that are going to affect your boot experience , so figure out the correct combination
if this is only happening in the one app , it 's likely a problem with the app itself
if the target device reallocates blocks , or uses erase blocks ( as in an ssd ) then you 'd
that 's odd as it 's not something you changed : -\
it looks like all the po files get updated automatically :
with next rebuild it should be good again
yes
i already tryed nodemodeset
there should be an icon somewhere either next to your user or in the upper right corner to select which

er , the mac to be the same as the intended system 's one , i mean
nice to meet you : )
i 'm happy to add you to it : )
how can i make ip based ignoring ?
no , i have n't yet ; it 's been ages since i wanted/needed swap
after editing the entry from grub ?
no , you strongly misunderstand . i wrote parity on purpose .
no , 8.10 is eol end of life , install a supported version
oh , yeah , i guess that 's actually the correct goroot ... i had forgotten how it works when
yes to that ports are closed by default ?
if you find yourself a 1gig usb stick its gon na be pretty cheap , or search the internet for

have you ever tried that ?
no i do not know how to do that

we use the gpu for 3d ray tracing
using gemrb
yes i am talking about bug 1419555
hah , it 's hard living in the future ; - )
it 'll be a bit of work to add watching of env life in there
whatever comes default in ubuntu 14.04 lts
as they mentioned , it should be in the next image so we should be safe to add it now
3.5.5
choose something else
you made it look like everyone is needing that asap . ( because that seems the case on suse ?
good to hear that ... im upgrading now ..
+1 : )
we can sync from wily to that ppa , ca n't we ?
auth failure as in the signing failed ?
that be ubuntuforums.org . i fairly active on that one .

can you run the command

restart ssh after that
it will produce an `` xmir '' binary as well as all the normal binaries : git : //people.freedesktop.org/~mlankhorst/xserver

ah we thought you were idling : p
how did the moving go btw ?
git : //git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/wily is what i used
you can recreate partitionining with parted or with the gdisk tools

i 'd be happy to , but i 'd like the noise gone before i do .
then yes
is there a kernel i could use ?
i would try a driver switch first + reboot to make sure its not a driver issue
i 've got an lxcbr0 network interface
log in at a tty then check your home dir for any files not owned by your user
but follow the link to the build log and you 'll see it being added there
ok
hm , i wonder what i did differently then
do not remove systemd-services .
apparently : - (
it 's just a gui to bzr
it 's up , if someone has a better option , or it 's not ok to use it ,
boxes is a redhat thing they may have bits in the system that ubuntu does n't so you may need

so there 's that file in the custom tarball /custom/etc/dconf_source/db/custom.d/custom.key
just install ibus and select keyboard options at setting screen .
we will remove set-sticky-ip-address since claim-sticky-ip-address does exactly the same thing as set-sticky-ip-address when you pass an explicit ip address
i am running a pfsense router . i have the squid3 cache package installed .
also , check `` /var/log/kern.log '' and look at the messages when those devices are added by the kernel ,
yes , moonstone is all doing bugs atm
i tried again just now
soi just did it the hardway :
it 's because we have n't done download support for workspace-runner .
i mean is that the right one ?
14.04 lts
i was going to follow what is in framework-policy/apparmor/policygroups/client , but the docker repo seems broken
throwing emacs at it now ...
12.04 aint supported anymore thats the main diffrence
of course
try that in firefox
firefox has its own addon manager

good evening
just patch it ?
read the answer and links provided in the answer in full

if laney does n't review it i can try to have a look this week
correct : )
zgrep -i ntfs /proc/config.gz
not yet , although it it on every corner ; - )
which issue ?
as i see most strings are changed in august with this language , and it is okay with ota-7 ,
that shows 2.2 is out ?
and if it 's trying to change any old config files on upgrade , that would be massively wrong .
yes i mean entire system .
it 's basically a case of `` oh , the scope went away , let 's drop it from favourites

perhaps not
it 's just that there 's no fade- { out , in } of the two quicklists

yes , that would work
its a vm so i cant use gui
can you join # ubuntu-discuss ?
i 'm going to try and recruit you again , so i would n't say that : )
welcome , what can we do for you ?
yeah
gsc will be the software centre
'sudo ufw status ' and check
and unless you specifically need 14.10 for something , i 'd recommend sticking with 14.04
is there anything that can be done to include ubuntu mate in beta2 ?
you can not edit an executable

cleaning the connector pins with a pencil eraser before reinsertion is always good , as is taking a toothbrush to
i 'm havin some weird quirks too , that i did n't have in arch ... no idea .
do you have a bug for it ? ( i guess would be nice to scrubscribe )
maybe . but i already searched . no .
oh , actually ... on more recent versions , set it to 2 instead of 1
have you changed anything or it is me ?
htop in terminal
am i supposed to search for that on pastebin ?

does this happen at random ? can you control+alt+f1 to get to a tty when it freezes ?
i 've tried many kernels though
right , but it just stops there ...
these are destructors , the go and come , depending on compiler version and optimization level
if you have a live usb or cd , you could just use it to chroot and modify /etc/default/grub and
it 's not my home ... it 's a private rented room ... i can not put an antenna on
there is no uninstall package , just the installer
it might be as simple as supportedorientations : root.usenativeorientation
which gets it 's settings from xsettings plugin
so i just set 27 to tested , if you are happy with it , we can immediately land 27
82158
what if you have onwidthchanged : { if ( width === 0 ) return ; reflow ( ) }
got a link to what changed ? i never know how to find that lol
long time no see
it 's also very specialized - rotation does n't work in this way
yes
what 's your theory ?
so is this flyer good ? should i pay a few bucks to get a pile printed up or do
but nothing in that repo which conflicts or replaces with what you already have .
looking for the easiest and best way that would support timewarner cable . network architecture is very simple . i
considering you have a full backup , it will probably go faster just to do a full re-install
good , was gon na asxk
it *could* , but that 'll mean adding some ec2 creds somewhere
ok , cool !
ah : /
well the system monitor showed 100 %
yeah
kubuntu 's default password is blank , iirc .
that 's basically how i feel . about both . : )
oh it is usb ?
do n't forget to test it on a disposable system : )
to restore , you just `` adb push phone-backup.tar.bz2 /tmp/ '' then phablet-shell and `` tar -jxvf /tmp/phone-backup.tar.bz2 '' and
you can `` attack '' this a few different ways.. one easy thing is , share what terminal you want
will says yes , we can do it in the sprint room and anyone who can answer can step in
yep^^
yes
but in 14.10 can not install it !
crickey ; i 'd love to know what you did to that system !
i 'd probably search the machine model to see if there were other people with issues or a walk through
oh : /
it 's not that , probably just the color scheme not agreeing with me : )
i used screen for many years , i now like tmux a lot more ... but again ymmv
as long as it 's ubuntu support related . otherwise general chat in # ubuntu-offtopic : )
i usually adb shell , or phablet-shell into it
you use activities in vivid , right ?
hell , it 's probably some script kiddy thinking he 's being awesome
ok well mystery solved
check this :
ci would know , i never worked on boottest
then you have access to root .
lets double check . yeah
but in this case , perhaps it should
and omg that 's your problem right there . you 're on a congested vps .
just checking : (
or something in between : ) but right now they 're broken
oh . i was n't sure .
what kind of boottesting ?
i bet you wish you knew about that workaround before ; - )
contact the developer for support
i 've had it on my radar to `` null '' the package
no need . better use your win7 and ubuntu dvd 's for proper flogging
excuses : p
at the moment it just picks a random number between 0 and queue size ... so you can get duplicates
because the gcc compiler is too old in 14.04 , and the ppa doesnt work properly
np ... i 'll keep digging
and that 's an excellent point , i do n't deny it
and there are ms office unity webapps too
no , both are card 1 .
can i pm you ?
some apps in the store do , like bigmovingtext . that should start working when the branch and the apparmor
right ; there 's lots for me to do to get x86 running , i 'd like to start with
is there a way to list all packages using apt-get ?
no actually , wait a sec
feel free to run your intender on all the sources maybe while you are at it
what files did not get created ?
i have not understand
sudo apt-get remove vagrant
try clearing .cache/session
the gates are closed for new things , but not all silos prepared before the deadline will make it as
no one is dictating anything .
awesome
but i recommend the ubuntu mate distro since it 's what i 'm using
nope , it was directed at the person . are you partitions a proper filesystem like ext4 for example ?
given that it dies in three weeks , quite possibly .
a new login is needed
no , make a new changelog entry above the debian one
turned off
that will only work for the existing files , right ? what will happen if user2 creates a new file
i have no idea about your `` windows platform binary table '' question . what does that have to do
ok , so /dev/sdc is the boot device you want ?
check wiki install from wiki
( mostly ) kidding .
please give more details : what ubuntu exactly ? what vlc version do you need ( want )
okay , going to read a book ... ..
yes
if you were only targetting snappy , that would make some sense ? but it seems like if you wanted
is there any wrong with compiling ?
now everything you said makes sense : )
yeah but i need some knowledge
difficult to promote an sdk component which does n't exist : )
yeah , think of it like a transformer
ah , great !
no , i 'm still not entirely sure about windows . there 's no hurry , i need the corresponding
it 's hexadecimal
but having done deploy-series , fixing those rough edges surely comes before making a massive and unconsidered change to the

that 's desktop amd64 or i386 ?
i see gcc-defaults arriving in proposed . will it be copied to release soon ? i thought proposed required a
how can i do that ?
i want a newer driver than that , though
yeah
^^
no , qtubuntu is a qt mir module that is now actually upstreamed for qt 5.6 / 5.7
the *_logged_in context managers temporarily switch out the interaction , but they restore the old one afterwards .
you 're in luck then ; )
arbitrary being linux .
it seems they changed some jenkins urls for custom tarballs for a few channels - or gave us wrong ones
open install gparted and give sdb1 the boot flag , than run the grub update again
you said you 'd remove some code , i 'm waiting for you to remove it : )
ah , do you hear audio when you run 'aplay /usr/share/alsa/front_center.wav ' ?
what exactly did you compile ?
under linos . so for example my ubuntu dir is home/linos/foo/bin/debug
do you know the required package ?
anyway - well done for getting done what you have in the last few days : )
perhaps something turned around and tried to adjust the timestamps ?
but since it was mentioned that some cloud providers have `` special '' images built from them , i guess
i 'm in the mini iso
i was thinking that too : - ( and would be an easy fix with normal repos
ty
i 'd really like to get that landed
and when i do that it it says 'e : unable to locate package python3-ubuntu-ota-tests '
ok. tell me when it completes . i am going for dinner . will be back in 15 min
also iirc at some point somebody audited the app store for any apps using this and notified them that it
do you have make/model information for that adapter ?
yes , local tar is what i had suggested in the past
brendan tested and rejected it this am , it does not fix the issue it seems
it 's pretty much only kernel updates
at a push , i can hack on this for a few days if i dig out my old android
vegemite is like marmite evil twin
my router , yes
that mail made very little sense
they are called `` pains au chocolat ''
i ca n't make the meeting today : ( sent you an email with the updates
dunno
ah , cool
i didnt see my name . that is why i asked
i have some spare cycles to do it now , seems quite a nice one with instantiated services . just
show the backtrace , that one is very disctintive
the number is ?
but i 've idled with linux for now , but it exists on the launchpad page
awesome , can see them again : - )
apw i 'd be happy to know how to do it
well i stated how *i* would do it , not the official ubuntu method .
you can accomplish that with a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
i got converted because the languages i wanted to write in all were best supported in emacs modes
haha , ok , your call then . i 'm not really here ; - )
no
^ do you know ?
oh , actually . it might be that it works for new files , but not changed files or something
yes , that 's the same thing . inside the init script , check $ ! , something like echo
you did it .
fancy fixing this in the archive/
ha ha ha
we have lts versions which get 5 years support ( 12.04 , 14.04 ) . if you ware on 14.10
if you ping me in here to say go - i 'll get the release announcement posted
you having a meeting with yourself ?
latest qtbase changes are just test and s390x fixes
: d yes
both , see the commit i linked to
so pinning the versions fixes that ?
not much when it comes to app development : p
maybe for vivid . it might be racing in trusty too which has no systemd by default .
just read through maarten 's email ; reading the fwded one now
so ? how does that effect the test plan ?
ive never used cryptkeeper no
o/
baloo-kf5 itself did n't change , so i suppose it 's due to a dependency change
try the reboot : )
use ppa-purge to get rid of ppas you dont want anymore
keep me updated
maybe we need that static somewhere , topic is a good idea like padroni suggested
well you should be able to just recreate the partition table on it . assuming you did n't get into
yeah probably then , but ppas are unsupported so do so at your own risk
search.apps.ubuntu.com/api/v1/package/webdm
well systemd mounts / ms_shared . but yes it also had this problem
hehe yeah .
yes .
ridiculous
it 's actually quite nice : unpack armhf .deb , copy library over , be done : )
like i 'd said before - i 'm tired . sry for misstyping your nick .
sent a cal appointment with a hangout , please feel free to move it around as you see fit
yeah , we need it in overlay
ok i 'll keep that in mind
hi
it 's just that the personal folk are dealing with the same one level deeper
i had a look at your mirsurface rework , one idea i have is to move any pure c++ classes
next try on the general cas : `` sudo apt-get -- reinstall ca-certificates '' then '' sudo update-ca-certificates ''
quite possibly
so youtube lied to me xd
does this means i have to have the kernel source on that system also ?
i also got this error : invalid system disk replace disk and then press any key
if i reboot it , then the network comes up fine though
did n't it say before it could n't find the license ? seems like now it says the license is
where ?
but you can still request them ?
thats xwindows without a windows manager
you can check out , xev , and xbindkeys , might do the trick
ok
and having the cru fix in 1.21 will make the issue a minor annoyance rather than a blocker
'mostly they are the same ' is not the same . it 's debian . it 's possibly the sysadmin
the main objective right now is to get your original system booting
yes . which will potentially was a lot of time trying to debug . for the same reason context menu
i have n't used it , but you might be right . i 've only used bind
awesome . maybe we can get it in for w : )
right but most people have many devices , so i could n't assume that .
look'n
i have n't had this problem before , and would n't it show an error saying incorrect password ? also
if you do an actual fork ( ) , the parent_pid is that of the calling process , the child_pid
i 'll take care of that now .
`` sudo fdisk -l '' and all should make sense .
i 'll try caressing that url if it does n't work later
one needs fixing on that one
a markdown linter ? a thing that told us when we were n't following some kind of 'markdown best practices
your fsckd patches are n't in v219-stable
raiding swap is usually a good idea . prevents inconsistent swap when a disk fails .
try the deep search
ah : )
you need a 80gig bluray bdwmv : p
? ? ? how does any change in vivid impact this ? i 'm very curious
look at your .changes file , it lists the packages it would upload
like what ?
right , done - no further comments
using what bluez ?
it might help if i set up ssh lil
owa , urrgh
see the link klopsi-u3 gabe you earlier .
yeah , quick nick change
i 'll log in out again , maybe something took time
man , this ish is so tight .
what exactly would the format of packageid be ?
what is slightly misleading is that the dialogue window saying `` record your encryption passphrase '' , which to me
yeah ... for e.g . one of thre greeter-tests it spits out a very long option-list from process_helpers.py which has
those never worked on trusty
no it does n't afaik
i 've looked there , but i do n't see any more info than `` channel with a developer-oriented custom
but you 're adding to a set rather than adding a new field
/join # freenode for network support questions
nope due to differing versions causing issue .
but really - if you have a couple of old drives , use them as a mirror for the root
well yeah , the initial one in proposed had those issues and was replaced later ( again same abi number
are you looking at func ( environ *maasenviron ) networkinterfaces ( instid instance.id ) ( [ ] network.interfaceinfo , error
yeah , so the cool kids can show off with it now : )
no , without nomodeset , it loads the intel driver
yeah , that is outside media-hub it seems
oh , efi and legacy bios boot options would be implicit according to my discussions last week with slangasek
yes
ubuntu is a complete linux-based operating system , freely available with both community and professional support . it is developed
if you can bear to hit both of them i would be most grateful : )
building c++ scopes is n't even doable on 14.04 directly
ping
1.3 is not yet released , so you will get them only with dev-proposed images
i 'd suggest `` sudo rm /var/crash/* ''
? ?
what does `` service libvirt-bin stop '' do ? is that going to kill everyone 's vms during the upgrade
cool.. could take a bit for all the changes in that *very* latest to come to the ppa you are

if you do n't know why you are doing something , even if you think it 's `` keeping your
i do that often , but i do n't understand the underlying logic of where the apps are distributed and
you one of them ?
do n't forget a full context , hardly understandable as of now .
yeah , thats it .
while when using a not corrupted node it works
oh , you mean `` efibootmgr '' ?
heh
do you have a build log ?
needs to be vfat formatted
i 'm on willy
too late now ! why did you have to tell me that ? : (

ok , but that leaves me with some horrible code converting that to bytes .
there are 312 entries starting with the word `` # ubuntu '' . : p
bq are selling the device , they determine what goes on it
sounds good , i 'd try the install now then
soo ... shipit ?
hi
from the about page , or where ?
yep
no that 's not the problem : /
it 's a chroot because they 're building a new root filesystem .
this also happens when i install vim
^
you 've removed the partition
output will be written to ~/.cache/upstart/application-click- < appid > .log
`` cat /etc/apt/sources.list ''
can you pastebin the output of `` ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/ ''
yeah , that may take a while before that happens : - )
yes please .
im going to guess 512mb ram opengl 2 support
why are you copying these elsewhere /
halb-zwei ? hat augsburg noch gespielt letzte nacht : ) ?
well , it is only day 2 for me : )
ok. then i 'd recommend to follow all the steps from that wiki page . that will get your project
for smoke runs , we do things over adb . i have problems with ssh a lot to phones here
installing 50 mb of dependencies just for that seems excessive ; dpkg -l might be a lot ligher ?

any idea when python-networking-odl will be in the cloud archive for kilo and liberty ?
that was because of tightened validation logic . since the upgrade steps actually did n't work it was reverted to
just use a cli desktop if you want this , would be my answer .
bodie_ worked on that part so he may remember more accurately
aight , that would be no problem : )
fsvo `` manually '' that involves a scripted loop and some api calls , i hope ?
i 'll get my branhc review 'd and land
really it is per removal , some apps are cleaned with a purge some are not completely , there are
any thoughts ?
but yeah , i 've been pondering that

probably better if he 's using linux on the workstation ; )
no clue i 'm afraid

ok , that 's what it looks like . the code for this is in qtmir , correct ?
yes , via overwrite
nice !
please to review
actually hold on
you there ?
ok , great
here 's another one
just as long as you do n't use a modern browser
i ... i ... i have never gotten it to work ...
grrr , i 'm tired . the crc32 is at 0x58 ( 0x258 in the image ) and its there
wich ubuntu version ?
when using the xubuntu live you may press any key before entering the screen with the language selector
as , that its included ?
is there a way to change to a differnt version ... like i can downgrade back to 14.10 then try
asterisk guy ?
no , just remove those
what about a 2 pronged thing - do an install , then try and confirm some bugs in an app
will there be a session about that in the charmers summit ?
the title you mean the `` bbc '' ?
hopefully that 'll do it . good luck .
yeah , agreed
there is no new build for krillin either
which command are you running ? whats the full output of that command ?
dimiter and i went through that on friday and corrected the dates
just wondering - it could potentially be awkward i guess , if someone uses an incompatible agent version
i do n't use default.pa , i just know it works in alsa
working ?
sorry , no . i have not had that experience .
is there a list of supported audio filetypes ?
apt-get install gccgo
my big concern is that no one saw this in vivid for two months . so it makes me a
personally , i replace broadcom chips when they are problematic , but , it wont hurt to try the available
you might actually be right , who would have thought ...
ok , this one is breaking the devhelp files
ok
i thought you were talking about that ...
it probably should never have been closed there
good night ; )
the locate returned about 50+ things
did that perhaps start when you did a kernel upgrade ?
the difference being the `` func ( `` is n't on it 's own line
yea readed that article of linus
i 'm not your best source in this area for exact answer is all , others here can quite well
but , like i said , there will be more flexibility for non-framework people when 'sockets ' is implemented in
perhaps purge the new one first ..
and even plan to make it really easy to share them via some repository , so that other people benefit
so surely a state based solution is nice , but not needed ?
better to have something to do than nothing and just focussing on the fact you feel unwell , right ?
hmm well it sounds reasonable..
something funny with me having a xeon as a daily driver ? : (
because i 'm in peru !
lazypower : also how do you guys evaluate a charm `` following the spirit of ubuntu ? ''
just means i need that one copied by someone else
who knows - i do n't think people are not seeing issues
but i can get it as a sub dependency ... e.g . if libevdev-dev pulls it in , i could
failed to get d-bus connection : operation not permitted
the main ubuntu channels require that you speak in calm , polite english . for other languages , please visit
you need ~ci-train-ppa-service membership to upload sources to silos .
did you ever have an issue and came here before ?
if it 's intel you do n't need pulseaudio , phonon can work directly with al ; sa instead
yep
and if it is 'manual ' then have no bridge for 'eth1 ' , but we would have a bridge
you found it , you fix it . i advise removing the mention of a specific version at all .
dont say you are dumb as an excuse to not think about what you are doing . that is not
maybe some banks support that for businesses , certainly not for regular people ...
paste the link it gives you here
although notice if you now purge devscripts , snapcraft will prompt you to install it
well , then you can update your control hackery to make it say > = 1.1 in vivid and >
you reboot and hit whatever key to get into bios , then look at the boot sequence
yes i installed some python packages for installing whatsapp from terminal : /
anyhow , i get the idea that the upstart script is broken .
wallyworld caming today ( still on holidays ) - back tomorrow
sounds like you 're overthinking it , plus swap is fine on ssd
re-commit the 1.3 bit
do you see the section but no data ? and if so can you refresh the scope ?
i 'll file a datetime ticket for letting the client app specify an icon in qorganizer
that was tongue-in-cheek , mind you . in the non-ppa archive model , foo-security is correct , since foo is
no need , what i said would work fine .
did you talk to dholbach about it ?
feelings ? haha
if you remove that beginning dot , they 'll show up again
yes .
yes , i tried it many times . if i turn off the wifi , then turn on it does
try to open the dash , type software , click on software & updates , then try to select a

linky ?
also , stub has upgrade tests from r127 of the charm , any idea how we can work out what
i 'm sorry but i 'm not quite so free for a handholding right now , though it 's beginning
basically , one the message is in the queue , it 's up the the process on the other end
at some stage you removed the trans statements from the template
when we push to one of the branches mentioned above it also updates the other branch . so i 'm
how did you install it ?
assigning !
yeah , to no avail
trying to think of where to put the +new-snap view . it could go on /+snaps/+new-snap , but then i
what happens when you try `` apt-get install libconnectivity-qt1-dev : armhf '' ?
apologies , how can i be sure my schroot is indeed running -proposed ? it does show in apt sources.list
has riddell moved the next stage 2 repo into the main archive ?
set network manger to not manage that interface .
maybe is something you can fix later..
.deb 's are the native package format on ubuntu . use 'dpkg ' to manipulate them directly
how do i figure out the number after ~ ? that stuff confuses the hell out of me
good idea definitely
ahah , on reading , i prefer that tbh : p
if you can start the app , yeah : p
there is no `` ubuntu 14 ''
looks like spanish or maybe portugese
i guess the 'add a new address ' is why we need new authentication for +editemails ?
whoa , you mean reboot the live usb ?
i created an iso today using u-d-f 0.20snappy7-0ubuntu1.2 calling udf core rolling -- channel edge -o img and dd-ed that
currently , we are doing the html stuff first
do you use ubuntu ?
if you 're serious ... well , there are lots of pages about that
will do
does n't explain rtm though , ( or it never worked )
it 's not /necessarily/ messed up .
1244 mib
oh yeah , crud . it appears to belong to brainman , the guy who did most of the windows
the unit=debug is added unless you explicitly turn it down
i 've started reading it , so i might just finish for my own benefit if no one elses
we had defered the resizing stuff
ok
no : )
good ; ) you still have time !
i do n't think so . i always run gomaxprocs=8
there is something funny going on with the software though ... or else it should stay constistent , i would
doing alright !
you would register music-app as a `` destination '' for music
login box appear on both monitors
happy2help !
it would probably easier to keep it separate from what you say you need
it might be worth getting alexis to talk to steve l about dates , yeah
ohai
so , how do i do that ? let 's say i have a team already
hexter and hdspmixer too .
you 're just wasting everyones time with your nonsense questions
will try . did a clean install again , so i 'll try that after updates if it acts up
sure its pretty nice , new libreoffice also
in general
dito
im new to syncing sources for android and stuff
so the thing is that once you have selected the armhf kit as target you should be able to run
as i understand it , this is all still very much a work-in-progress
ok ... hold the mayo , lem me upload it somewhere
virtualbox thing ?
it is there .
do you have a feel for how often it happens ? i occasionally see webbrowser-app crash and was curious
aquarius : although , app devs could do this import ubuntu.components 1.1 as ut ... and then use ut.mainview {
.
you will not be using the proprietary driver unless you have specifically requested to do so
furthermore , systemctl start [ tab ] [ tab ] for auto complete does not list it either
alsa-utils
are you using a desktop or laptop ?
it 's working now !
alas ! needs fixing . inline .
but not forcible termination of host
i 'm developing tox if you know it
any idea how is the package that contains the atheros firmware names ?
geforce 9300m gs
ah yeah , i used the proper recovery image for it
does this message appear red to you ?
afraid i know nothing about gnome or unity , so i can not answer that .
thx
as per the description in the mp/bug , if you install something from the store , then the department appears
yes . because those are two different history files .
uploaded
i will not ask a 6th time now : /
yeah , that 's expected , because the vivid package is n't built from mps , it 's built by
ok : ) then i 'll just free up the silo and find later on if that should have happened
tell magespawn that he is up too late
nothing
however before i start , i wanted to inform you that the city list will be defined in a .cpp
linux-headers and linux-image ? do i need anything else ?
you get no response to the search right ?
totally agree ; perhaps i 'm assuming too much to think there was a rationale for opt-out originally
i run computer with it plugged .
took me about 6 months with ubuntu to figure out what not to do , started on it though so
cold as it is today i 'm worried about being mugged for my coat or gloves
but i do n't think it 's the root
do you know if your ethernet card is old or new ?
good !
do you know if the wireless interface would be initialized enough ? or does it need the android container to
but this shows some things you should read up on and practice to become an elite linux developer
no , but you can dial in and look at the presentation . slides are in the meeting invite
start editing /etc/crypttab again
does what ?
should i delete the xenial build from the ppa ?
should i go ahead and get that reported for kal ? i doubt he can get to a terminal that
nicely done
you can see the entries that will be in the final sources.list near the top of the build log .
to be correct , `` you can not flash ubuntu touch '' , someone already flashed ubuntu desktop to surface
yep
anyway , that is the rule i deploy on pxe .
oops - bug # 1475662
on a different note ..i 've recently stopped using vnc ... and i 've installed nomachine instead , for faster
best is what you make for your own . when you are comfortable then `` roll your own `` .
are you on ubuntu or some other variant ? nautilus is the default file manager
can you please paste the log from the first mir_demo_server ( the host )
yes
no problem
ok . i can take that on .
then i guess we need a specific instruction to disable that archive for now
your name seems to be associated with some of this code , so perhaps you can tell me ...
errr .. ok
that 's a weird setup then ... 29 has indicator-sound in it , 55 has media-hub , qtubuntu-media and qtmultimedia
if that 's in /etc/environment on the phone today , yeah , that should probably be elsewhere too . :
if i start it with x , then i get this screen that lets me specify the environment ( kde
try changing to 346 first
we can start a junk project
if i can reproduce it with your .crash file , then you are entirely off the hook : )
?
ok , so no property changed notification and zlso wrong values for cangonext and cangoprevious
although it 's sorta tricky because it 's still going to have a bunch of consistency concerns that are hard
the `` tools '' ppa
`` currently '' no , but if you follow bq on twitter , you 'll see them announce the next
i agree , i get similer signs .
sure , if you edit the kernel parameters in grub , they will only take effect after a reboot .
but we 're really really low on time
np
no , it wo n't make a difference in which default line
weird.. that opens the url just fine in chromium forme
might be interactive though
sorry , i meant untar .
no worries : - )
just got to that place with my thinking .
if i remove update-grub from snappy update 's code path there is no work in handleassets ( immediate at least
it has booted ubuntu before.. i unplugged the dirve ubuntu was on when i installed windows , and then when
alexisb mgz : robie had a brilliant idea to solve the deoloyer/quicikstart/pyjujuclient problem . maybe we can include those plugins
they are not , but the charm-helpers implementation of status-set is backwards compat
well , ntfs does not support permissions ...
we know
ram ?
natefinch so the next release will have full multi-release browsing support which would allow us to get to that page
i 'm running arch in a vm now , just under 2gb storage space used
do i remove that line too ?
of course we are
again i ask , does it go away
sure , did n't argue about that . my hair just stands up if i read uploads with patchery so
perhaps we should just be following trunk
snappy shell and try it maybe
and i wonder where i should put the docs
we already provide a ppa , but it would really be easier for users when it is directly available in
prima , danke !
see +1
no worries : )
try adding `` gfxpayload=text nomodeset '' to the boot options
ok , then i 'll revert the style changes
needs to be listed twice , once with x86-64 and once with i386
if you have n't added your public key , you wo n't be able to ssh in
: )
was just wondering whether you wan na work on some stuff together
also ... fwiw ... i have silo 22 with your call forwarding branch installed
the `` timezones '' are just some libraries that convert those seconds to friendly human display
ubuntu server edition is a release of ubuntu designed especially for server environments , including a server specific ! kernel
sorry 'bout that
surely _id would jsut stay at the top level with the others
oh really ? that 's a shame ... i held high hopes ; )
deterministic , yours or the apps . ; )
so only tvoss can currently approve that
what is the output of : cat /etc/issue
thats ok.. at least i have updates which include hotspot support : )
leaving instances around , that cost money , would be much worse and we should really avoid it
please do n't be writing any code , this is a learning experience for me : p
holy shit ! that worked ! : )
in the logs you mean ?
the intention here is to block script kiddies sniffing the internet ports from doing mischievous activities .
i believe my computer gon na crash soon ... i used -- purge a moment ago
wb : )
not showing
try sudo apt-get -f install
there was no point preparing that partition beforehand really
you could try holding shift while the pc boots to get the live usb 's grub , then press c
i would love to help , but i have no idea what that means .
depends on the program used .
what 's the command ?
yea just let me get off
new installer ! \o/
i 'm sorry ... ... i really thought this would get us somewhere : - ( ( ( ( (
you can set proxy from browser as well , so yes .
it 's sending unicode . see alberto 's latest message
look , we talked about all this inn the spec
to be precise : anybody with the time and with nothing better to invest the time in can do it
do you make the directory ?
hm wait , for autoresize i already need something installed alongside , right ?
but this particular syntax is used for arch restrictions already
sorry ; do we have to do this manually every time ?
do /join or /j
occassionally i 've done kdesudo to launch dolphin for example so i could access these drives .
not the boot order , there 's a boot manager
no problem
you just came in and saw 3+ people talking , of course there is .
thx
no , currently on shutdown it sits there
just having data , even 2g is enough to make sure the fix did not break data connectivity
yeah . you could go all out and delete all hidden .folders and .files
what does `` stacked on '' mean for bzr then ? the trusty-proposed branch lists stacked on utopic
and since i set col l , it should publish properly right ?
neat possibility , no idea if there will be time to do that soon..
i 'd have to install lm-sensors as well , no binary here . that could take a while again
ok. so now boot up the live-usb with ubuntu . then you can point the installer to install into that
no it starts an empty one - but there are some apps that loading before desktop
umm , maybe ? let me try to find it .
topic closing
we are working with the kc on resolving this
give me a sec to get a new image
it needs to be set to 2.0
for example , if it 's just a label , you might consider being able to change it
yeah , i doubt there is huge diff on that though
oh , the `` missing fi '' ?
studio_ said something 9 hours ago , i 'm hoping s/he has a highlight log
let me write it in go for you , gim me a bit
i 'll dig into where it comes from
k , peeking around the code
i would like to file the suggestion from above : `` ask for pin code after x hours ''
not just juju-core
this is what 's on my system search.fs_uuid c65ac418-c145-4a7c-b965-1308aa595d24 root hd0 , gpt5
and we should have detailed documentation about it : )
where ? i updated that
this 0.1.2.9 seems not to be released
you 're more than welcome : _ )
doko : if so , would be helpful to rebuild all kubuntu 's package with gcc/g++ 5 and see if
never used tmux , i 'm all ears
awesome
seince its not directly in /etc isnt it ok as it is in the paths file ?
yes sure , many services require / can use a stun/turn service
okteta is ok to push ?
i 'll look into what 's run after installation , my guess is yes , we can get past it
cool , good luck man
`` this location could not be displayed '' is the title of the window , what i posted above is
oh ... i understand those type of actions exist , bu how do they relate to the juju-client config on
so how does switch tell the difference ?
not gon na happen off windows .
some log where i can dig ... ?
it seems my local build is pass the build phase , in unit tests , so i 'll push a
just curious
you can give it a vanity name while you 're at it , if you want
dude just saying it
how long does the backup take btw , across all the nodes
logout/login ? seriously ?
sgtm , looking at those now
no , i 'm asking where to file it : - )
thats unclear , to me , as well
harder when you got lots of stuff going on and if they are asking here mostly that is the most
of the helpers style , yes . but boiko needs to restart unity with testability if his tests are running
ah , right ! sorry . ok , plan b . do you have your ubuntu installation usb/cd ?
ok i come to that later ... i see is just paranoia ... for developer mode you need a keycode
ah , my bad , make that trusty
otherwise i 'll just dig through my giant pile of mails and bugs : )
bug 1489591
sure
im managed just fine to bootstrap manually on mac
try typing . /etc/bash_completion
i am designing sth to replace the `` tab '' selector , that will be a big `` rectangle ''
oh there should be some there .
was one of those updates the kernel ?
why are properties nested under params.. everything else next to properties is effectively api garbage .
try logging in as guest
no what is the media you 're booting ? : )
yesterday i fixed all
ssh + cp
same ...
that 's the dep wait
ah , so it 's not even clear that we 'll have it in that week in the first place
not missing anything yet : )
okay i see , well there 's a cd which should have the same drivers i guess
just green smoothies
as i posted the generated makefile have the proper strings
did it ?
just look at the diff , it was there : )
gzip : stdout : no space left on device
write an email to the raspy2/broadcom people
so i 'd suggest about 8gb of ram maybe intel i5 cpu , and 128gb ssd disk from a good
mainline would be better than compiling your own , but waiting for wily 's kernel to pop up in trusty
according to apt it is
ctrl + | ?
memtotal : 24841608 kb which is correct
you have to put in the right uuid . worrying that the other tools do n't find it .
okay great .
)
had it charging over night , woke up and the screen was unresponsive so held down power and volume up
but when i try to update it no new version is available
also your usb should appear under /media/
select * from `` usermetricsservice : : datasource '' ;
fwiw , i 'm trying to factor some stuff into one place for state , and i 've ended up
and other address types later , mac addresses , addresses for bills , whatever , can use their type as
you also might have to adjust the volume of the source port
yes it seems your branch is missing things from mirv 's . i 'm off for lunch but should be
regardless , that 's not really relevant . df is pretty clearly showing me that there 's free space on
guess you can easily test that logic locally first
yeah
the provisioner has the env right there
and does it do `` exec= '' as specified in them ?
on looking through it unfortunately i could n't make head or tail of it which leads me back to square
box of cds or something
/boot/cmdline.txt ?
i 've been getting it a lot , but i 've just attributed it to `` no upgrades available ''
basically just need qtcreator , which 'll work wherever .
so you 'd say we should fix nautilus or ... .. just use a workaround in unity side ?
all i would say more at this point is that the decision to use them and then the bulk of
the previous one was a dual landing and only released to vivid ( probably manually , i see errors in
no
give us a vivid upload to match ( or backport the vivid one instead , if the wily one is
to try to put a windows iso on it to try to install something from taht
yeah , i ca n't exactly just flip a switch and turn a certain part of my brain off either
err ... should n't recoonfigure ask me questions or something ?
it uses icmp packets
i 've never used it , but what is your qustion about ?
i 'm being lazy relying on you to test stuff , hope you do n't mind too much
i feel better now than earlier this week hehe .
if i remember i tried to set the offline mode this morning , maybe it did n't set off correctly
it certianly wo n't be perfect by then , but willcooke has a list of target apps to have packaged
woot : )
you want me to paste inodes output ?
so chromium ?
i use a few tools to backup to various places , but usually just my /home and dont worry about
no . and the weird thing is that the whole unity suite succeeds .
not clearly , i 'm an scientific inquiry user , i want the facts . ; )
`` you guys '' might.. i am just a volunteer
hi ! when you have some time , can you help me understand if bug 1393697 is still valid or
ack ; i guess i 'll give them an initial spin tonight then , and do the finer-grained install cases
that 's needed for ?
however , your ask ubuntu discovery is very interesting there
i 'll send the mp tonight when i 'm on my main machine
well you are exiting : )
so we are n't hiding a soname change without package rename with this , but we fix it ?
otherwise i can try to hack the fs mounting code tomorrow
i dont know if this the grub2 splash screen
well if ya got a monitor hooked up we can safely assume there is some type of graphics set .
( i 'm sorry i 'm really really ... a noob lol )
but for people like me and spencity , we can do more than basic math and we are responsible students
already installed
yes
so how do i resolve this ?
if the dkms packaging comes from them , by all means , tell them they 're wrong , but do
maybe the use of bus-name needs to trigger a check on what bus name you actually choose
i would say that , yes . i have the affected hardware , tested 0.11.0 that was uploaded today/yesterday ,
system settings - > display and monitor - > compositor
ok
also , could you please run the unity8 strip-tags on your qtmir branches , it 's got infected somehow
did you pm me
lgtm
flash is still supported as a pepper plugin , but i have n't gotten that to work with firefox yet
so if you have n't received that message in say a year , you can remove that client
display hardware ? you mean a nvidia gpu ? >
laptops , desktops , tablets and phones all with ubuntu + ssd
hm , all hunky-dory here , same boring `` never breaks '' as always..
i hate the number 5 .
for custom ? not that i 'm aware of
the api does not restrict the count , design recomments 1 in leading and max 3 in trailing
wow , weird message than .
the spyder 2 needs the windows install disk so you can extract the firmware , but that process is simple
i get that you 're angry , but that language is not allowed here
upstream 314
and the master has n't been packaged yet ?
i try and prioritise stuff for other people , but the top five items on my todo are all for
i did n't recognize your nic
that 's a xen guest ?
ok , tell us more
unfortunately there 's no easy transition
spec files
well , is it ? are you digging in teh orientationhjelper ?
ah ok..will modify the desktop file and try now
you wound me , sir .
what about them ? they 're handled manually so as long as you prepare the sources by hand then you
from the user 's xorg log you mean ?
'should n't '
ideally you should n't be using any swap .
i 'm on ubuntu-touch/rc-proposed/bq-aquaris.en r149
the store marks anything it does n't know as application
that expanded the partition , not the filesystem .
it doesnt matter what model
and support for expired edition is gone too ?
georgous !
pastebin the output of `` lsusb ''
my guess is that the code that adds cpu-power is coming later in the call stack and appending it ,
shit , right
updated and published : )
or for global /etc/profile
maybe i can see if i can get the bot to post notifications in reddit and irc chat when its
i had to fix them each overlay-scrollbar and/or gtk update = (
great , so i ran the command and got the following
one fix would be to open /etc/apt/sources.list and to replace the version name from 10.04 with the one from 14.04
do they have the complete version match including the xubuntuy extension to the version ?
which i have n't backported yet
and we ca n't build a new rootfs without releasing it , which will mean people have issues with boot
actually in that instance , you have to tick the box
me too , only can not close chat *lol*
... is it an eq .. or convergence ?
mir looks like its doing it right hmm
iirc it 's just a matter of making an ubuntu usb stick and booting with it in
yes that repos is n't working for 15.04 , just comment the line or remove it from our sources.list
the dashboard is running the wrong tests ? or jenkins too ?
haha yeah : )
did a bunch of test writings for ubuntu make ( and brought arduino support )
no prob , hope you get it worked out .
the blog might not say that , but major version bumping means that the 2.0 plugin will not bring anything
well , usually ; )
we 're talking about the provisioner on the machine , which does n't have access to the complete environ
just get your file permissions right instead of making a huge security issue out of it
if you think there 's something to fix ping tony , but the general idea is to have that as
is n't that what i also said ? : p
my problem is having my android phone being detected on ubntun crouton
you link the iso and the usb in the app and hit enter and like magic you have a bootable
i may be referring to something different . the right-alt key is often used to trigger multi-key characters
do n't worry aobout it yet , i 'll bug you about it again later : )
same for pulseaudio , libtrust-store-dev is available as well , so a rebuild should go fine
porting ? the nexus 7 ( 2013 ) is a supported device , you just install ubuntu on it
i did to , however not everyone has the skills to deal with issue , common one no sound is
it 's actually not too surprising that a server process is not running by default on a desktop distribution ,
an override for the 8 apps instead of 6 was written there ... but it seems the dconf database was
if you 're really lucky you 'll get a nice backtrace visible , because a backtrace can give a hint
hmm , /assets in a device package is long gone
yeah , and to make life easier add helpers inc and dec ops and assert unchanged ops
alright . rejected . and now off to vote before the polls close .
it 's our new ota-4 candidate , it basically only needs checking if mms group chat is disabled by default
that code yeah
no it 's not the same

sorry , i would have no idea .
you pretty good with mysql and apache2 tweaking on the memory footprint front ?
i never installed xubuntu . i have both ubuntu and ubuntu studio on different partitions of the same computer
it would be immediately below the bottom of that image .
it complains about not finding juju-log.exe at some point
it is
sometimes i 'm too busy to help , but it 's so frustrating to try and have to dance around
'dpkg -- get-selections '
something like that , yeah , round about the atlanta sprint
right now im making the mint stick to resize the / partition of my ubuntu laptop .
no , we do n't ask for a coredump if there is no sas and its not on armhf
and yet he 's still committed to supporting those flavors , even bringing in new ones
what have i done ? i have used the plop live iso , in a dying drive , to boot
does other users or guest account work ?
i 'm just wondering what our future plans are . is the plan to do away with .jenv files entirely
risk spending a lot of time .
can you explain the thought process behind snappy_global_root ? i was hoping i could just change the location where things

no - was n't aware of that

really ?
aww , that 's nice

oh another shared issue we had , right
check the ubuntu-studio channel , they have expertise about audio software
sure . i 'm just curious as with the stuff i 've been working on , trusted sessions behavior has
sorry , you tyring the branches i mentioned ?
no
lol @ joe smoe
it 's on my list , have n't gotten to it yet
well , but the symptons are nearly the same
i do but i always prefer ppa before i do all that hassle myself : d
just hold left shift at startup to boot it once manually from the menu , if it does n't help
checking
this is ubuntu support . ask your ubuntu questions .
right
if that gives you a working terminal , you can start to work on the issues
there are no beginners or expert . just people who has knowledge about different things .
did you build your system , or plugin a new ssd ?
i 'm actually on kxstudio , a slightly mofidied ubuntu , it normally uses kdm

so they did n't say how it 's better

maybe because of a incomplete upgrade ? should i go ahead with trusty upgrade ?

ok so you do n't have it installed
i will paste a link
i 'll run this by jjohansen and tyhicks as well

or edit the start script similarly : )
the given approach gives bad values on a wide range of not-very-unhappy paths
it 's not a problem , i just do n't agree with the approach . let 's fix the actual

yes go for it . i consider what 's there a rough cut . i tried to cut out the

i do still consider that pretty serious breakage
the string assignment is n't atomic . if you call login from one goroutine , which modifies the tag ,
we should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it - and stop
hm , it 's actually taking 20 already , and still not done
ok , thnx . will discus this internally . if necessary i will check on the ceph-channel as well .
though i thought that wl blacklisted b43 when it was installed , so would n't that happen when jockey wacks
yes , you should be able to do that just fine
did it change recently then ?
i would also need a live cd , and as mean as it is , i only have one usb
yes
or source code ? or what ?
i know that now , i package some things where upstream does n't realease tests in the tarball because it
good ! : )
but ci being broken atm makes it a bit hard to tell ( there 's ongoing efforts to fix ci

sure do
ah , how about qemu ?
did you receive my message ?
yep . try it again and let 's see if it gets further this time .
was that a public ml , or internal one ? i. e. anything to refer to on the tb list

that is upstart

pardon ?
no , the name it gives in the connection call
that is , change to a vtty , log in , move the contents of ~/config/kde to somewhere
you are using an eol release , an unsupported version of ubuntu . that explains why you are not able
i am doing well . and you ?
even now ?
ok
what was the ppa i needed for that ?
what if i am , i still dont get where my files are going
that will work . i do not see that `` ant '' is available in 15.04 however . i would
read up on nice , it is probably what you really want
just name it so when users add it it 's easy to remember , etc .
anyway , i thought we were calling it supportedseries
oh , i guess i 'm confused about the difference between bug 1442308 and 1441319
you could use a generator for that
what about the dash ?
can adb recognise you device ?
walked into that one : - ) sorry i meant more `` how do i locate the files needed ''
for the gnome ones , its probably easier to tangle them up together , maybe ...
yep , that worked
but i doubt that is the cause of your issue ; more likely the # 1 end and # 2
conflicts/replaces : the logical union of the two , ie : overwrite the whole package , prefer me , i
yeah ... actually i 'm assuming mdeslaur wanted to push patches for those , which is why i wnated to
i have n't done it in like a year , but iirc , the directions were terrible
awesome
yes it is .
so , qemu : -serial stdio -vga vmware , and boot with console=ttys0 , then you get some crazy text
sorry , how new is what ?
i installed the plasma-framework from the proposed . is it safe to upgrade the rest of the packagesin that repos
then i 'll fakesync -6 for you . : p
get the environconfig and use config.new
but i approved it as it 's working as expected
define `` device types '' ? any i386/amd64/armhf config we can boot on ?
sounds like you have seen the broadcom wiki , not an area i really know anything beyond the wiki .
ok i understand . i 'm looking for the settings that relate to the trash bin but i ca n't
one thing the u-d-f client side is useful for is that it let you tweaks bits of the image
hmmm ... all i did was apt-get update & & apt-get upgrade
maybe thats why it gets faulty < ?
try the oss driver and reboot , test if things go better
i 'm getting that feeling too
looking to upgrade the video card
yeah , but just to re-assure : )
i 'm in my last hour of the day , but if you wo n't run out ...
yes , the box is handling it
i guess it needs a proposal in order to go in your silo ?
if you could enable the cronjob that would be sweet
of course , there are plenty of nice packages also to make your life easier
i can prolly reroll that without an abi bump .
ubuntu 14.04 has an nvidia driver that is too old to work with such a new nvidia card
if that was the topic for osomon , you could do a session to cover all the apps inc browser
srry not used with those terms dunno what means
permissions do n't matter ,
yes .
i 'm going to be here for the rest of the day pretty much , so you can bounce some
oh ok
so for small envs it 'll probably never happen
i 've no idea what happened , i had them installed and then they woosh disappeared somehow .
ok , it 's easy enough to add the required method ( s )
the duplicates should have more information
util_test.go:1406 :
ok , looks good ! : )
have you tried the boot option : noapic
when doing `` ./runtests.sh ''
i suppose you could argue if 99 % of the existing tests pass , it 's a bad thing and
yes ; is there anything else ? : - )
me too ...
deal
no
^
but that does n't install the missing language packages for libreoffice , for example
i 've not seen any unstable behaviour in kubuntu 14.04 ; what specifically have you experienced ?
our land registry does n't have `` branches '' though , just a mainline
`` ubuntu-drivers devices '' would give you a similarly empty list , i 'm guessing .
that -is- odd : ) that 's a good one , hehe ; can you plop a 'strace ' in
for the moment
or teamviewer ?
its already no enabled
also i accidently downloaded ubuntu xenial : )

while you indeed can make the system rw and use apt on the rootfs , you will get into trouble
wait , why two more ? not just armhf ?
it is indeed what you said , however as indicated by a question , i 'm asking what you mean
put it in scripts ?
i see a title that does n't make much sense to me just below the landscape ss
this whole thing stemmed from an indicator-network bug
sadly , i 've tried . they do not offer support except in online forums .
yeah ; ) when the trains says that there 's a build failed , i usually check the logs then
keep an eye on the kernels installed . the /boot/ partition is too small really , a known fault with
as far as i understand the problem , yes , eg . if you upgrade 12 lts to 14 lts
you should try ninja
how can i check that ?
my bad
i do n't think setting displaycommand in xsetup will do anything , it gets set in sddm.conf
ok , set it to 8300
part of the problem is not everyone 's like me and you . they do n't necessarily see that they
as for the new app icons , they will all be changed in one go..which should happen *after* ota-4
correct , and using the same one between webdm and the scope makes sense
how about trying to get to the public ip when i 'm on a local network ?
oh , that explains why my facebook page shows no cat pictures today ... humans must have evolved !
not a clue , sorry
linux wont make any magical setup automatically make your machine `` better ''
?
yes
i moved over to claws mail because thunderbird kept breaking on gpg signing and evolution kept doing that there is
my suggestion - > use vivid already : )
i 'm out for the rest of the day . public holiday today : )
you 're probably in another screen session or something
oh , i see now , i was indeed a bit confusing , sorry . fixed !
both built and published . synced the packaging changes too .
s/faster/easier/
yes
precisely
good question
also , what makes this an ubuntu support question ? : )
no idea . only have ubuntu on it .
the installer wo n't erase anything unless you told it to ( such as selecting a partition to be formatted
definitely wrong on that one
not many options either
will do
hey , you have the livecaption branches based on top of mousecursor
garheade does like that i was using the mini size
failed : -/
if that didnt work try reinstalling the libgtk-3-common package
nope
aah , so nothing in the ui was expected ? hmm .
coffee please
well what you had in last feb was proposal + demo ... now its working prototype work in the past
so we 're saying let 's just land the script , it will get some exposure and we can move
then there 's a space after it
you can , but ppa : s are currently broken
not all the examples are building , but that 's expected , right ? }
? ? ? ? ?
ack , i 'll have to poke at it more , but i *do* know that items detailed in point
it affects at least webbrowser-app and ubuntu-system-settings
ah , that way around ; yes
openssh spawns ssh clients
i 've been to scotland twice , my fav country ( glasgow , edinburgh , around )
it 's not a necessary change , and does n't work like i thought it would . it 's been
ext4 then , better for linux
yeah you have n't actually detailed the problem yet
mirv ignore the opengl error , looks like my nvidia driver broke : (
but keeping a driver with known bugs in and that lacks support of new cards in the name of stability
gues so . dont knwo how to confirm
the only think i can think of is passing down the parentmargins in a var and using those in the
excellent . let the infrastructure melt a bit
does n't look good
at startup
how ?
ok , sounds good
is this a new feature ?
i 'll test the silo in this case
i. e. nm thinking activated - > unmanaged ( reason 'sleeping ' ) after waking up
ok , i 'll get it this weekend then
could you recomend one ?
here 's how i 'd do it
more to do with window managers ..
so it wo n't get testing deps of deps that are n't in the original package list
no idea sorry
you can always log in as the user and run : sudo -l
will do . please hold
so i remember to watch them
your data would add to that
there is not this line in my /etc/apt/sources.list : s
you can lower the res system settings | display
so , you have xp working from a single partition ( sda1 , 16gb ) , is that correct ?
i 'm pretty pleased . aside from the touchpad being a little sensitive on 14.04 i do n't have any
you rock
the run config does that
cool . we have a private bitcucket repo
ebb and flow . there probably was once .
but bascially we can just do a dist-upgrade and see the same thing right
ah , the side i found is having me do something with bzr etc
activate developer mode on the device , connect it via usb , run `` phablet-config writable-image '' on the host
i will use that as a fallback , but i really wanted lubuntu to be very gui-based like mandriva
where do i put that option ?
you 'd think people familiar with the old and new data models could migrate from a to b for the
we did it that way expressly for the furture work on the launch command : )
can you normally select text in a standard tmux session ?
left hand side is the instructed state , so what the user intends - then the right hand side is

do you see it in the scrollback or shall i paste ?
has your issue been resolved ?
awesome.. looks like the app works just fine
ah , just noticed one more thing - the fclose ( ) ret val needs to be checked in write_string_to_file
there is a python module called glob .
and ?
should be good , tryed other usb ports ?
so we need one white coin , one black coin , one white m sign right ?
it did n't start installing any packages . it was just downloading it .
i was talking about g-c-c btw
how ... odd .
what ?
is there a way to do that in grub ?
sorry i missed the mr 's , can you re-link >
great , just let me know when you rebuild your packages again ( removing the ~test )
this feels like homework ...
try it yourself , deploy 1.22 then try -- upload-tools with only the new jujud in the path
seems like the close calls are async
why are you using it ?
i have *not* tested yet , am ref-lashing
dkessel , my guess is that mir just does n't support optimus atm
seems so
it does finish next time .
yep
what are you talking about ?
i did n't look through it with a fine comb again , but this looks very similar to the changes
there are windows machines that currently use samba to do business with the server yes
mister mail scheduler , will you tell me when it 's ok to send mail to the list then :
huh . does n't usually run as a daemon .
haha !
maybe we can suggest another alternative for you ?
and you should stop ending every sentence with `` ! '' . just use `` . ''
probably with a ppa is the easiest . apt-get source , edit debian/rules ( not cmakelists ) , run dch

the only file in your the pages folder is index.rst

what driver ?
have you ever made an `` real '' backup from your flash ?
trust me , we have plenty of experience with 3.13 being less stable than 3.19 on the buildds . ;

i used the previous kernel
it all just depends , ppas are `` personal package archives '' , so anything can be put in them
is there an entry in /etc/fstab for it ?
i am a bit confused .. as that command should have returned partition info .. not directories . how about
men/whomen from china : ) ) )
sure , doing in a few minutes then !
did you disable fastboot and secureboot ?
you mean install ?
so last question ... is there a better or recommended method for replacing os drives ?
yeah . we are currently at 25c here in north germany . bavaria has it hotter already .
will it work under my normal user ? i just had n't setup root account yet .
hmm could be bad media , dvd or usb flash drive ?
the 0.15 pi2 sanp is in the store though , `` -- oem pi2 '' should work as well
useradd/adduser , then passwd username to change password
so i 'll just report to mousepad for the moment then - we can sort the where out post-wily ?
cool
and history . ? .log.gz
i just set it down to -20 and there 's no change .
move , not erase . should be the same process as shown in the wikie
only for things like software compilation
dont get any coding done this week which is slightly annoying , but otherwise im good . ; )
also , wondering why most of the numbers in gtkscrolledwindow are hardcoded ( such as the proximity ) ... and
uninstalling and reinstalling the same version ?
just use debian . it 's not ubuntu .
typically find those users using the weixin/wechat channel
unfortuntely he became afflicted with a muscle/nerve disease where the muscles lose all strength which eventually leads to heart failure
that 's qtmir-gles
alternate suggestion . do n't dual .
available in vivid overlay , for example
sure , no problem . should i use pastebin or just paste it directly ?
so , i 've just checked using a daily in a new vm . i have multiverse enabled too .
would be fine for me
also , i did mean update , not upgrade
doing it now
^
actually , it 's much easier :
but i 'll write out the email in the morning
perfect , just approved
i must not understand what you 're after . i thought you wanted your very own customized ubuntu ? ?
because why not ?
but got several apport runs for ofono , urfkill and nfs-common , most of them already known bugs
you should be looking at upgrading to 12.04 sooner rather than later
what i always do is shrink down the windows partition and then adding a shared partition for both oss
heh ^_^ , mines in a stand with an external keyboard so i have n't noticed that , yet
ah
no , the feature is there , but it 's broken .
i can try calling delete or removing the scope from the temp scopes list , or allscope too
if i can - link it
hmmm you know what ? looking at your last pr gave me an idea
i am discussing it with kaleo , it might even be i am testing something that i really should n't
the failed tests have nothing to do with qapt

risk of nerve damage
why do you think so ? we could still be quite precise with timely delivering updates

still digging through the logs to figure out which workers are not stopping

a bit of a rubbish christams really , how 's yours ?
in all seriousness , i seem to recall that was a result of miscommunication and *everybody* was happy when it

see arch wiki
sorry , just plain old stupidity on my side .
redmine from ubuntu 14.04 packages is old , version 2.5.x , ubuntu 15 has the latest redmine package 3.x

no problem : )

sure , if infinity has more of a clue as to what 's happening or should happen with dpdk then
click-review would 've told you about # # # vars # # # and # # # profileattach # #
i see
it does n't like the -f in the command you gave me .
maybe check the bios/uefi settings for everything drive-related ?
could you ping me when you get a few minutes ? i need some help with a bug
same package
should n't matter what port you 're forwarding from . that 's handled in the router .
of course , it happen often .
how frozen is it , does num lock still work or is it completely dead
can you please do a `` ls -l ~/.local/share/online-accounts-hooks/ '' ?
yeah : /
i 'm getting the sense english is n't your native tongue , would you mind asking in your primary language
should do : )
one for /home/app and other for /home/user ?
unity8-dash.log > dash.qml:265 refference error : scopestyle is not defined
did you check the md5sum ?
standard ubuntu with unity ?
i was just kidding ..i tried kde on windows and it 's pretty clunky
or , give me $ 15 for coffee : )
ls /boot , confirm you still have 3.2 kernels , then just purge the 3.8 ones
tempoarily or permanently ?
well there are no reads when using strace , since it 's mmap-ing , so that would allow me to
it is n't built atm ...
telemate 's built-in editor was all the editor i ever needed on dos .
u r not travelling very far in april ; (
i guess so , i ca n't send to the channel currently ( and nobody else is either )
ubuntu 's unity uses 3d acceleration though ; )
yes the code is on silo 34
never encountered it : ) it worked for me whenever i tried to resize , even if there was defragmentation
never mind : )
nope , i 'll leave for university in like 25 mins : (
sorry , no idea . that 's why i stayed silent . : )
bah
i half expected that to be a ghost buster image
can you close ?
what are you trying to do ?
and another question , why not just do pip install from the build stage ?
yes i did that
now this is a mystery
that 's the proscribed 'best method ' ?
those both clearly already work , so nope .
hmm : /
seems true for search , but does n't seem true for installing a package
normally not , qtc should notify you when there are updates for the chroot though
yeah . you should look at the terminal app ; )
what is sudo and for what serves ?
best one is still th topic in dri-devel ...
as monkeydust suggested , backbox isnt supported here
a little bit of background about the acpi dsdt table . it is actually a form of executable code the
and they 've managed to make it worse instead of better : p
dist-upgrade to get new kernels , methinks .
yeah , we could do that plus a capitalization of the first letter
so it should match the machine id of the api server
windows 7 does not appear .
lets hope best : )
from the desktop file for the application . which would be $ ( appid ) .desktop
how did we get the parseupdates wrong ? ..
correct , ubuntu servers will take control . say and prove the opposite
doublecheck also dmesg and syslog logs , for bluetooth usefull errors
and probably a few floppy images embedded in the iso as well to make them boot
so you 're saying the ubuntu team does n't really care ?
probably not for now
i hear ur pain \o/
what are you *really* trying to do ?
a sure
the one command if you want grub still is my point , you want it on the ubuntu hd ,
i 'll try
just to rule that out you could try and boot with upstart ; a better bet is probably to grab
failure here
location of the real directory followed by where you want the new link .
i could do most of the stuff with stdout with openssl and have the calling environment pipe it to a
'does n't work ' meaning no update dialog or no effect after restarting desktop ?
same result
i missed the param conversion from the apiserver - > state struct
eh ?
pushed
just one .
maybe try the no acpi boot option ?
scp , possibly using rsync
run it manually and see what it reports : `` sudo os-prober ''
uploading to lp and such
let 's try to land as much as possible today !
as before when i had *:631 i was getting the process already running thing , so change it back to
i see but the client does n't notify me
set the background color to dark , and colors for text
... scratch that , it looks fine : )
i fixed pyflakes and pep8 on yesterdays mp
i got my backups but ended up just blowing windows out all together
it 'd look to me that at least the mp linked to from qtbug is only found in qt 5.5
well , presumably that would happen on reboot .
ok , i am checking it out right now
are you using a laptop ?
type lspci -k | grep -a2 vga
right . push is me , and i 'm going to make the appid optional one way or another .
hop on your bicycle , and grab a 64 mobo here
yep , known problem
-- -
no problem , as long as i get one : )
no
retried boottest
see `` man parted '' and the description for `` unit ''
ok , the task i 'm doing for gci is for the amd64 , so it 'll be about 30
bump to new version numbers ?
heh
of course , packages being installed on a system with bad ram can copy corrupted and so be permanently bad
start doing some work for a change man : - )
where can i find it ?
it usually comes up in developer mode once you unlock the screen
let me try with disabling acng completely
yeha vps
wait ...
smooth
will do
there also tend to be 2 or 3 versions of the nvidia closed drivers available ; try the other versions
does lspci list your bt device ?
could be broken
on those , finished a meeting
all 4.1 work is happening here until 4.2 is released : git : //git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/wily master-next
we did go to the kc as soon as we reached that decision

aha ! i remembered it from somewhere and was wondering where i had heard it . fun !
it is possible
yeah , and one of those weeks is just compensation for overtime ... they are basically forcing me to not
any thing that i can install exe apps on : )
right ; but i still fail to see how you can have /var/lib/apparmor on nfs under upstart
maybe , though the section is n't really talking much about the structure
or more like the connection freezez . the browser can stay on loading for ~30 min . this stint it
it 's meant to be a convenience so you do n't have to import runtime for what should be the

i 've seen it ... 8.1 is sleek , is flat and transparent as well , and intuitive i 'd
well , the security stuff does n't depend on the team
how can we change the interface so that we are less likely to break them upon future redesigns ?
still running
thats what i thought so i guess i could manually remove the links from /init.d/
you can do what you want just be aware of support is all .
i. e. if i see them in `` sudo upstart-monitor '' , but not in `` upstart-monitor '' or ``
right . egress rules and all that .
why not just use sudo like the os is intended to be used and you 'll be fine
i have a theory that the presence pinger is still active when state is shut down

again sudo mkfs.ntfs -q /dev/mmcblk0p1

are you using dual monitor display ?
which is ironic , because ubuntu one used to work well on android : )

no
or just stick with 4.9.1 : )

yep . i 'll implement pagination soon so the list does n't just grow to infinity . in staging i
depending directly on apparmor only makes sense if you *require* apparmor to function . the nice thing about the i-s-h
i was asking whether or not there was an updates ppa for 15.04
that kinda flakyness smells like dbus
yes , so that we could enable it at some point
when i press ctrl alt del it takes me to the login screen . but i want it to start
yes , i tried that stuff . that works . but installing the guest additions is the problem
well i did merges and the like ... and it did n't fail me .

i was just wondering how to get xmir into it
how does it feel now ?
anything past 12.04 that is not eol really . the main reason i 'm upgrading is because the wireless rt3090
do you cook your breakfast on it ?
but , none of the alarms ring anymore ! ! ! !
so it 's not a one-shot type thing .
his website is only updated daily
yes ( as i was using before , in 14.04/14.10 )
because it must have a 10.50.0.0 network connection
get it working ?
that seems like a question someone who cared at all might be able to answer = )
find anything enlightening in the log ?

it tweaks the unity desktop
did you do anything special to get it that way ?
bzr revno definitely says `` 2 '' ?
how good is your hardware ? low spec install lubuntu .
it 's nice not to have to scan all subnets to find the ones associated with a space

in theory the service could have been destroyed , or yeah , bad placement
yes rings a bell
mentions in reviews : - )
if it has a usb keyboard which also is n't working , that suggests a chipset driver is required too
ok , cool

it will be basically that easy . there 's some dependency work to be done though .

or expand the extended partition first , then the partion inside that

oh neat
and i remove the comments
sounds good
i can create one with both snappy-system.txt and uenv.txt too , or you can do it yourself via `` mkenvimage

that should suffice to secure ssh .
i pushed 3 almost 30 minutes ago , but i do/did not see the kubernetes-master-2 in jujucharms.com
yes
yes , custom backend is probably the answer

you need a sudo user or root

ahah , with my amazing-to-come bonus , i 'm sure i 'll afford one : p
that sucks
yeah , delay is the only thing i 've in mind

yeah the bridge one

methods that dont need a receiver are called functions : p
what about an __init__.py ?
i know that is an realtek
you 're ok ?
testing out the fix for that today

no clue . i did n't add that ...

can you look at that ?
great , it 's good to just understand what happened : ) seems all clear now and correct , we

yes
i dont see any streams activity , like it is n't trying at all

so sftp comes with openssh install , right ?
that 's a crap reason to do anything : p
it would n't be accurate to set a depwait on libjs-jquery ( > = 1.8 ) , because libjs-jquery-scrollto might

well , your question is fully answered there .
best practice is `` use a bug with several components '' when those components are involved in the same issue
i made them ossnap , appsnap , kernelsnap now
oh , right so why the ppa : s allow building such things ?
that did the trick . it also rm 'd upstart . systemctl no longer reports the error . thx !
so we 've come full circle/ no idea what the command does in windows so ca n't advise you in

like : sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=1 ..and yes , unmounting is recommended
so i 'll go to bed instead . : p
k .. be nice to know the release that you are using . in later releases the tools to install
lol i got only for 100 bucks from a friend last year
well i just told you : )
follow the guide for usb persistence instead
and sorry , i was more thinking there of how i 'm mentioning the ' -- fixes ' option in
i 'm looking at 14.04 and 15.10
funnily enough , this related to a review comment you made : )
in that case dont use it
how so ?
because it 's an experimental system , so exploring it is different than production deployment
not bad idea
one of my machines would complain that there is an issue and would fix it by removing grub . this
the auth channel between gdm and gnome-shell is quite fragile
tq
if i wherent that lazy i would have written a working line , but that one is not that far
its actually elementary os 3 .
ok . so all three , unversioned ?
you 're running in virtualbox ?
yeah that 's expected behavior
i 've ended up deciding that the urge to patch is basically always wrong -- it 's just working around
if it is obviously broken ...
sorry i did n't catch it in the initial review : )
give me a link to your version
oh sure . i assumed kenvandine would do it , but i 'm here
done , and spammed around developers to get them to `` me too '' it ; )
you should read your messages , oerheks told you about ppa-purge
good for me , blueskaj just said same issues but reported no problems , clivejo had an issue in kdepim
afaik okular saves some annotations and such in an extra file ... used it long time ago
and i see that there are no settle_after/ settle_before logs for those failures , which would make investigating those failures
sym links are alot more common than hard links
initrd.img is the kernel 's bootstrap into the real root file-system . usually required for all by the simplest configs
the meeting schedule is monthly , which is why it 's taking a while to get something sorted i guess
yep known bug : )
good news is , grub2 is back in business and my ubuntu installation booted fine
i would concentrate on your logs , and see if anything usefull shows there
which is why i 'm running it in a lxd container
yeah i agree with oerheks , check the final log it made
yeah that was the one . i have been able to consistently repro that one on my box since august
or sorry , 10:00 am my mistake in co
( or even to its blahblah.maas hostname if you 're in the maas node itself )
the test ? did you mean text
i 'm quite sure it does n't as my kernels are not removed after an upgrade
to the new ubuntushape , for example ?
ok. right after the orange juice
yup
...
so i was wondering about this a little earlier . the expectation is that eth0.100 becomes juju-br-eth0.100
that monitor issue , do you get that with 346.59 ? do you have a 900 series card ?
oerheks , using `` sudo apt-get install ant=1.9.3-2build '' i get `` e : version '1.9.3-2build ' for 'ant '
ca n't physically do it.. so i 'll do it remote
the bit that changes the behaviour incompatibly . : p
/var/log
since , google-api-go-client is the gceapi
i am able to write to ftp folder withot any error ; its music folder specific error
just looking at the commands the guy did from within his ubuntu vm .
i know the broadcom adapter in my dells is finicky at times . wake from suspend , it wo n't
you can join the # ubuntu-mate channel
hi , i am glad it helped : )
already did that
why are you running startx ?
split it up - you 'll got to keep all pieces though
it 's not urgent though
yes
we all get tunnel vision at some point : )
on the server ?
what is the output of apt-cache policy xboxdrv ( in a pastebin , please )
first i still do n't know how to `` paste '' a result obtained in the command line into here
621 ? 00:00:00 rsyslogd
as i ca n't specifically see an option for that
i would highly encourage you to either watch the livestream when it is happening , or watch over it afterwards
yup , that would work
i 'm doing bug 1474606 this afternoon
i was n't sure if that was the limitation or not
but it is there for some reason to restrict read operations for group @ administration
let me think..
yea because it 's not checking that ppa anymore . but that ppa is an important one .
kk
want a couple ?
it happened yesterday . syslog just stops after the moment that it happened ( read-only mean no writing , not
i 'd make sure you have a backup before you start any of this .
got any tags for wishlist features ?
no hard coded `` session-0 ''
i 'll build it from scratch then
in addition to checking ignore twins
line 136 . try env [ 'ldflags ' ] = [ '-lpthread ' ]
i stumbled across the missing libasound2-dev just now , maybe i find more while working on the libsdl stuff .
anyways have to go for now . good luck : - )
i unset it , and running that command shows squid running
will there be one ?
you 've done no research into the problem just fired a random parameter
but b always fails because 'no other entity produces said requirements ' .
need a silo for line 107 as well
out of curiosity , what laptop ?
well , depends on your vm
do i have to configure the env s 2 times or is there a chance to have that shared ?
( well , we can use lava lmp )
on create first then on main
go figure , i have no idea wtf is happening with my stupid network
that can still be done if you need it , but it 's a bit more complicated to set up
gvfs > yes , the gphoto test uses umockdev too
no , they 're linked for information but that does n't imply particular workflows such as closing bugs
the hightlight _is_ the copy , now just paste .
it says unity8 would downgrade
yes you should file a bug indeed if pstate_idle is breaking you on 4.1 , it should be `` purfect
is the system a dell , or an acer or an asus ?
did you get a time for kubuntu at akademy ?
is n't the picker ui shown by the exporter app ?
also , we 're moving away from traditional menus and unity7
bot is still broken
you 're missing the location option in the policy groups so it wont find location
yes , there 's jobs that run tests on mps
this is the packaging take a look in each file and ask me what you do n't understand
yeah , stumbled on it when trying to add video support to podbird : )
i 'm not , that 's all i can say
only if there are no huge maple syrup heists again .
before . what happens with a ppa proprietary driver , is with a new kernel the old build driver is
experimental support is in oxide already ... there is a flag that you can turn on to utilize it for
i know : )
so bad ... btw , if we do n't have your operator in the apn database , please open a
ubuntu server edition is a release of ubuntu designed especially for server environments , including a server specific ! kernel
it is
try another driver from additional drivers list
eh , you may need someone else to help you . i 've only troubleshooted single bootloader setups : (
no disagreement . i believe in fixing bugs , not reducing ticket count . the latter comes from the former
it would be best to use the system config file for a change to the iso .
so for a -- no-restore-state i 'd have to have the `` domain-suffix '' : `` -- no-restore-state '' ,
so erasing that lock isnt the way to go
that qtmir code will go away
what are you trying to do exactly ?
trust me . you dont know the facts .
yes it did . but now with the hard drive install it does n't work
i understand that it 's a basic webkit-based browser
yeah , and i do n't collect i386 + amd64 , i should do that , because some of them
yeah mysql
might be because you left too early : )
-extra should probably depend on -base ( not recommend )
i have n't used azure .
well , it looks better with it : - )
same as any ubuntu , install apache mysql and php
open messages , tap camera , import from gallery
so it seems like there is a problem with the disks utility or my external hard drive already comes with
its allways about this active . it is nice and quiet , everything works ; )
yeah , so do that . : )
oh , yes : ) ( there are lots of ways indeed.. )
hm , ok , let 's mark it landed then - i 'll double check and clear it out
i have everything on vms on 1 server for familiary with openstack.. with maas-eth0 things can get to the local
i was refered from # networking to # ubuntu : d
unless you 're just no-change syncing from vivid , then that 's something else
it does n't look like the fix will work with that chipset , i 'm sorry .
does the presence of that dir mean it 's actually in use ?
agreed
now it 's searching for a tarball with `` 15.10 '' in it , while the one in overlay has
all of them still seem to be in the `` building for over a day '' state , i 'd
i know but i have ubuntu-desktop and gnome it takes space and i want more space on my computer
well , this is for a `` setup-classic '' script i 'm supposed to write
pdf is on the mobo manufactures site
if you are just getting started use a gui
yes under vista before 5-7 years . i had ubuntu 12.04 till now and the switch was working .
or better yet , where is the iso stored right now ? windows ?
ping me when yours are approved
just with the changes , it looks like all we 're testing is that the upgrade step has the right
: p
awesome
going to try something now , reset /etc/default/locale to , well , default
cool about the tests . you can look at autopilot for ideas too .
were you here for how we got booted into the ubuntu liveusb from the grub shell ?
on top of stable-phone-overlay
if there cyanogenmod for your phone
hmm
all this for 31.5mb ? does it really matter ?
channel is for english language please .
what is your aversion for ra ?
ok , we have today to land stuff
the issue is on my 3 screens , i have one vertical gnome panel on each , but , no
i 'm just interested in running the selftests on a device that has already been provisioned
did you login ?
multisystem
another little issue : i can see the icon of my charm in the canvas , but on the left
as our ! guidelines say , `` when helping , be helpful '' . if you 're not familiar with
maybe wait an hour and see if he comes to standup ?
i know it 's distinctive .. i hate when people misprounce it annoyingly as `` nation '' , which is
uh , missing translations in rtm ?
remove any disks lately ?
no
i do n't mind using lp , but it would be a pain to track in two locations
^
that says you only have the 1 kernel installed , should not have a space constraint issue in /boot (
without the create table command i get an error saying that the table does n't exist , both with and
which kubuntu ? and are you using ppas in your sources.list ?
read the wiki , you should of found first .
i 'm using ac with mine , and it 's never had a hiccup , but not all networks are
yup
i dual boot , maybe thats why ?
i am also annoyed
okay , my target file has csrf terminators .
no
i thought boot tests are triggered by packages which are installed on touch ; is it ?
the initrd /init script passes that parameter in its final switch_root
i heard that too , but when i show the right from left swipe , everybody says : `` how
no
right , if it runs fine in ubuntu classic and you do n't forget to push the debs to tools-proposed
ok let me look at the code
and then it remains as intel 08b1
i suspect i 'll be 85 and start giggling to myself and be unable to convey to anyone else why
also , details on `` cracked my website '' would help
`` pastebinit < ( ls -latr /target/etc/apt/ ) ''
a fix is about to land
does apt-get error when you install fglrx ?
type ls ( hd0 , gpt3 ) /boot/grub/x86_64-efi/
i have no permission to do that : p
it 's possible that i just do n't have *all* the output . getting output from the script this way
yep : )
the psk is not listed , although it has key-mgmt=wpa-psk and psk-flags=1
seveas right , auto is definitely misleading as its in fact incorrect
ookla is a speed test site , i get 10 ms there , but in dota 2 i get over
what makes you say that ?
why ?
sure
make it a `` support '' button on the main page , but it opens the page with the store
exactly my issue with xorg-edgers
/var/log/syslog says the following ( but it says this even when the trackpad is malfunctioning ) mar 31 22:20:24 linuxlaptop
from my glance over the spec i did n't see anything other than status , message and update time in
when you put the iso on the usb , yes
is all right ?
care to take a look at that tomorrow ?
( or is that a bug/misfeature in the py3 md parser ? )
frameworks are for mediating access to hardware
whoopsie ie evil
if its not a `` known good '' device , then i suggest not assuming the issue is with the
well.. do n't run it as sudo ... it wont work
sudo cp /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu/shimx64.efi /boot/efi/efi/boot/bootx64.efi
start off with `` nvidia-settings -- help '' and read
grep can not handle gz-files , use zgrep for those
clearly ...
20gb would likely be a good absolute minimum , single partition boot , root , home then .
different time zone for me ; all i know is 14.04.2 is now officially available . i 'm torrenting now
it 's just a matter of configuration
anyway add backports ppa : sudo apt-add-repository ppa : kubuntu-ppa/backports
actually just opening up the page itself i was right the first time , it 's actually closer to 80,000
oh ... does it replace mainview ? i will have a re-read of the docs on it tomorrow anyway and
you could do an apt-get clean first : sudo apt-get clean
just for the moment - so flexiondotorg has more who can help him - would him adding me to the
your first user is added to sudo by default .
had that thought , too . i guess it comes down to installing trustworthy ppas , then ?
no idea . sounds like a bug in unity8 perhaps . you should report it
i expect bugs , this first release is merely to get the code landed making sure that it does n't
where does the tarball sit currently ? i 'll compare it with what 's in the config
sure
i 'm an autotools boy . i 'm using that for my builds . it is the wrong tool for
whoever gets to it first can fix it : p
did they say the results could be easily done in 3 ? : )
i ca n't comment to that , unfortunately .
yup , try to learn something new everyday , not always successful tho ; - )
*groan*
other than it not building ? or running uss ?
stop doing bad stuff !
yes please
if this is fixable in just libreoffice that reduces the potential . but if it ends up needing sru 'd
if i had that power i would : p
i 'm just not that geeky . lol
thats a first step -- you check whats around and how much it will consume your cpu-power
endeavouring to get that juno update out as well
so what you 're saying is that up to a point i 'm quite useful , then i become annoying
can you also retry the build ?
no way ? how my user @ host : changed 3 times in 2 days without usermod or some another
try nomodeset
buy one then : )
yup , same here .
is it up to date ? ; )
as i said , i believe it 's doing it already ... but just to make sure .
that sounds like you have no route
do you use ansible in a big way ?
md5 is not broken . it 's not good to use for safe hashing , like passwords . is that
hm , was looking for a free `` as in freedom '' solution . also i said one at a
mouse works now
grub ca n't adopt any mode vbeinfo can not 'see '
oh , no , i did n't , nice ! did you see that behdad had some work started around
can you hit webpages ?
dialer-app is not on store , it is part of the images
if all is well , and the performance is acceptable , then , i would just use the machine as
all os 's are buggy and `` people '' frequently have no more clue than you do .
that would be `` apt-get install -- reinstall tex ''
not much
i had actucally considered blaming systemd , but then i checked , and i am still using init . also
and i 've been able to get onto my desktop . however , i did get like 4 different program
everyone else seems to use these packages/repos just fine
and if owner is root change it to your user
yes they are
its for my kids devices lol
elaborate `` still doesnt take '' .
this change helps catch things like new commits on mps or new uploads in the archive , etc . so
because when i first packaged these i put an epoch on everything but then other convinced me to remove it
how did you prepare the usb ?
the hdd *should* equate to a regular usb mass storage device . fdd is a floppy disk emulation mode
i only have 1 question : is it possible to install / and /home on different partitions ? or they
as yes - ta
your bundle is missing a machines section ( all machines mentioned in the placement must be declared )
np ; - )
he is trying to set a computer name to something interesting . last thing he tried was `` pc ''
also , change the logger to be 'juju.cmd.sos '
yo could undefine just one , then redefine it , and restart it with maas , just to ensure it
some special reason you did n't use gparted ?
yes a bad in the up of the screen
but its not specific to this file
that is his nickname on irc
it might be ubuntu-touch/rc-proposed/bq-aquaris.en
yeah , i do n't have it
allright pastebin the output of 'cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubuntu-ppa-ubuntu-next-utopic.list '
right , then constraints like spaces=foo.bar are passed literally to maas
do n't think that 'd be related to the sort of failure you had in system settings though
and it is not booting ?
i 'll push changes shortly to allow adding more than one test file , all of them are now in
configuration : driver=nvidia latency=0
i just pulled it up here in chrome
know the settings and put them into a text file
so grub itself sets snappy_trial_boot=1 i in its environment on boot and then the boot-script clears that value
yes
no they 're used as parameter to the kexec call that boots the kernel
mostly lack of proprietary software support like adobe creative suite , games but steam on linux has started to quickly
okay lem me try that
przeczytaj join
give me a second , i 'm going to reread and make sure i have the whole thing correct
tried that as well =/
if you have n't rebooted after dist-upgrade you should reboot to use the new kernel
correct
ah ok..put out a call when you want some testing done for it .
gdisk
not today .
i 'd file bugs for the bq device specifically where anything that their docs claim to support for media but
your talk 's in
know what ? let me ask to my best friend
ah , ok then : )
guess you can forget about that coke .
fixes the firefox issue we were talking before
it is not a `` manipulation tool '' it made a backup or copy a new image direct to the
so you do n't have an ubuntu bootable live usb right now , correct ?
yes , but the `` design study '' came into real with kodi , and there was no more development
so i will just flag those if they are specified at all . when we support uid and gid per-snap
does it work if you use this plugin to install plainbox ?
it exists
line 26 suggests directs you to the game website for supoort ...
mhall119 : what is mentioned as development , it si actually released for long time , and 1.2 is gon
i do for what i need , but that 's not how i backup
that is what i am telling you : p you can do it remotely
will not affect what kernels are installed however .
i do n't see it listed in the environments.yaml file for image-metadata-url
show us one of your problem jobs
we have the watcher , worker , apiserver releasecontaineraddresses method , api client method
should n't it work though ?
ah , well i saw you list a link yesterday that was for really old releases , however had it
ok : )
we 're running out of time ... anything in particular you want raised ?
can you run apt-get update on the system ?
nothing about linux/ubuntu/lubuntu will prevent you from installing in on that hardware , thats for sure . but , if
how can i make the image anchor as big as the image ?
but only for this one version ?
make sure the process is not running with : ps -ef | grep -i spot | grep -v grep
ah , yeah - it was n't calling supportsaddressallocation
i was on a fog during the middle of it
yes , i know . but i ca n't see why the mint experience should be better than ubuntu here
it 's just a name for at & t service
ya , i know . i worded that a bit strong
or at least i imagine
the apache-plugin charm would be a good start ; )
no problem
not that ! : p
sudo apt-get -o apt : : autoremove : : suggestsimportant=false autoremove
how does that make env-construction in the machine agent any less evil ?
try a simple python `` hello world '' first and build from there . so many things could be causing
oh that 's true , i needed gpm as well
is is fixable ?
so 32bit binary . does that match with the output of : uname -m ?
i am not saying that you do n't know whaty you 're saying i 'm just saying the git learning
the boot should n't matter if it boots
yes , i see the console for half a second and then it goes blank again
so in particular for doing a multi-config put ,
which entry should i edit ?
oh , wait , during *package build*
it 's in ~ubuntu-desktop
done
i want a linux desktop computer for work but i 'm not entirely sure that it wo n't cause problems
done
boot that live ubuntu . put that usb.hdd into it ( after booting ) . open gparted . format that
that 's what i 'm saying , it should n't
how is mako reporting gles ?
this time it 's actually happening : )
does that mean that 's the `` right '' way ?
sorry i dont understand
cheers
apparmor and selinux are two things to get started on
do you have any more logs , i 'm no expert but i ca n't see anything that helps from
have not used it for awhile so not really .
still fails . i 'll try adding -v flag in the utility script : /
i 'm merging it into a branch off of 1.23 upstream
vmstat 1
it easy
from what i gathered it is the file system that breaks , not the actual hardware . if it is
it 's possible that uefi might work , but it will probably depend on the firmware ...
i agree , but note , ironically , you got it wrong again ! : p
do translations from within the qml work ?
k. usually when compiling from source on debian , you often are missing `` -dev '' packages , which contain

thats not an error , but a warning only .

well , beginning of the week i broke the lighthouse , boom box and hammersmith towers
yes you are missing some hooks it seems
i tried to see if there was something logged somewhere , but i did n't ssee anything in system-settings log
it is hard to realise just how hackable an ubuntu phone can be until you get one in your hands
take it apart and re-do the thermal paste .
i 'm saying you are incorrectly inferring something from apt-cache which is n't the case
i 've not modified the bios
ok looks like there is no step 2. just reboot and check
well everything runs on top of unity so it has to be right , i mean below that it 's

of course .

no you did not , i asked and you never referred to it once .

no , just bash .

yes but my emails are cutted by hotmail they dont go in spam folder either , they are completly vanished
done
before you mixup sources , maybe search alternative ubuntu packages

if you use their hardware , though , keyloggers can be a thing . aside from that : yes ,

of course , i thought of that already . but it 's hideous .
and that works on the phone ?
it 's not harder , but doing a string lookup ( with context , as there are different cities with
is something like that even possible ?
wich wifi chipset do you have mate ?
then ?
ok , good
that other change.. could it be because mir itself changed ? doko filed a bug about it
debian ?
how can i check ?
you can use a special charm to config up your boxes first - i 've seen people use the 'ubuntu

you do n't have the attention of a 2 year old
sorry i had dinner ( 22:00 ) : )
lsusb will only list items connected via usb , not system hardware
graphics card + driver ?
that 's the sense i 've got , yes
if you do `` vagrant ssh '' then it 'll ssh into the virtual box instance that 's running (
alright , your driver installation failed , so `` sudo apt-get install build-essential dkms '' then try reinstalling from the

alright
no , there 's no ppa integration with autopkgtest right now
i 'm waiting for the spreadsheet replacement to go live , my commitlog generation scripts are made so that it
any best practice suggestions ? ?
no do n't push the version i have wait for v2
i thought you had left already , i 'm back to my room
i get scr*wed so others dont : p
beats me , i just google it : p
but you can add a css rule only for menus
to be fair , we have n't exactly expose hotspot anywhere .
oh okay then .
the version
cool
no problem : )
include the /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf in a pastebin
ok im going to try uninstalling jack and whatever goes with it via synaptic - i can always reinstall later
any experience with using juju on debian ?
we could simply do the same for uboot now , right ? my branch for snappy implements this cleaning in
that also did n't help
then you can either create 3 partitions 1 : bios_grub ( 1 mib ) 2 : ext4 ( everything left
nothing eth0
i came online a bit earlier than usual , before flex started to get frantic : p
the lollipop tree will not cleanly merge with the ubuntu kitkat tree
then it will be lost when you disconnect . ifconfig is a one-time command
yes
cool , good work !

you have reason xd
you can fix them and re-release the same silo
that was when i booted the livecd using eufi , and sata mode on ahci
i get worker/uniter/relation tests failing every time too
oops , ok , well then i am chrooted , i believe .
we do n't test code that rhymes
it is conceivable that a hostile mitm could be spoofing one key , but not another .
r u able to compile an ubuntu touch system ?
but there is a similar function .
you no good

how did grub4 get deleted anyways ?
ow : (
^^^ that 's all of them .
yeah
obviously , since the bios code is executed by the cpu !
whta version to what
still here ? forgot to add your name in my reply
huh well that 's strange , i just retried it with debug logging on and it looks like it 's
on everything , i was offline i guess
would reinstalling the iptables be fine
fix broken packages can revert stuff
hi
we 've now got a pointer .
dpkg -l | grep gjs ?
i will try and reproduce in a vm tomorrow
and you 've remove network manager is this right ?
specifically its using the lxc ubuntu-cloud template

not as yet ; there 's a lot of legacy stuff to deal with and inertia , but its possible
yeah , i 'm not seeing it on latest rc-proposed on krillin
however , if you do want it , there 's no reason not to install the files manually by extracting
the same as i posted above
oh , sorry : -p i just saw the 'unapproved ' on both those lines . i did n't take
will puuting the panel on top solve the issue ?
because you do n't have that environment variable . so make one !
i see - well , multicore cpus where not that common at the time i guess
if you manage to get autopilot-qt5 installed with a libautopilot-qt < 1.4 , and without qttestability-autopilot installed , then the

yeah , i know . i ran the test locally .
purge resolvconf , reboot , enter a nameserver into /etc/resolv.conf - be happy and enjoy : )
whoaaaaah ! ! ! ! awesome ! ! ! so , ping me whenever i have the dbus api in

try ./install.sh from the directory the script is in

yep
until we get proper wily image builds ( cloud images in particular )
ok , moved the first two paragraphs around a bit , from my pov it 's a go
indeed it seems we should stop that
yep
but that is the only suggested solution on the wiki
ok try `` su username ''
code not merged upstream yet , is that because we have not migrated yet ?
so i still have the linux-lts-vivid-cloud-tools-common package
10:12 < rvr > pmcgowan : jdstrand : right , sorry , i forgot to mark it
excellent . glad to hear you got it working !
yeeees
better grep that lsmod somehow
i have just a terminal with a `` grub > '' cursor ...
i forget : |
i use vbox5 from their apt sources , so to get a decent match it is recommended
everything else is merged and uploaded for sru team review

change to what ? and why ?
do you think encrypting the whole fs is a viable option ?
awesome . the good thing about our current model is that we could run it on your bbb and elopio
really and it is ?
you 'll find in tech , a lot of people have strong opinions and like to tell others what they
ok that sounds promising then
i know nothing about the origins of the hack
okey doke : )
hm , at least there is n't one in the store . is the api free to use ?
pura vida . the context is whatever conversation is happening in my brain . that can make for some weird
silo 10 depended on 006 and 001 and then there is any that have passed today
hmm , try a 15.04 iso - it 's not out yet of course but it 'll have a newer

in fact , try a usb regardless , optical media is dead
and what is that clamav program called in the repos ?
1.25 is blocked though , right ?
hello
lscpi | grep network what does that show as the card model ?
it seems to be working correctly here

: yes ... at the shell command-line you can then do `` lsblk -f ''
the .juju directory is portable , so you should be able to just drop that in on any system ,
are you on rtm or vivid ?
noted
yes , i understand that it is a virtual machine . but do not understand why it is very slow
yes
if not ambiguous - `` release '' means different things project to project
yeah , i agree the best thing is to add a job
no , it 'll be `` eh , does n't work , i 'll use docker '' ; - )
does this mean your irc client does n't hide join hides ? : p
i beleive you were told to use the something else option and use the partitions built , and were given
that does n't reset the firmware though
how ?
i 'll make a note of it on the bug
must 've installed mini.iso or server
ok ... now i have to think carefully : )
you mean in testworkerremovesdeadaddress ? that 's what i found in the existing tests
1. you guys removed usedeprecatedtoolbar in mainview in 1.2 for example , that 's an api break
also i sometimes hunt down gilir through facebook messenger xd
maybe you have to cd first
yeah , i get your point , i 'll think about it
ok
it was a vmware network config file iirc
salem_ : if you guys ever do a 6.0.1 or a 6.1 it 'd be nice to switch to the
yep no prob
at the bootloader , press `` e '' to edit the boot commands and add it between `` quiet ''
each kernel comes with an initrd file as well that assists in the boot process . fixing it is as

plasma-workspace , frameworkintegration and kdelibs4support recompiles are in archives
anyway , that bugreport you linked to might well be related
what runs without errors ?
let 's hope it 's a good incentive for ppl to contribute to docs translations
have you tried reinstalling the grub packages
also a copy of your config files will help in troubleshooting
lol
tell me where you are reading from at some point here so i can see what is going on ,
unless is due to the verticalscaling boolean
what is the output of echo $ dconfdir
mind if i go make coffee quickly ?
the kernel in lubuntu , im assuming you are using 14.04 ?
no i man empty where it should mention emtec..
go sleep . i start work at 0100 utc , ping me : )
ok , let me free it up then
uh no : p
wow thats good news i just hope it doesnt go too high on price
yeah , was on win7 before .
dont just say it here
+1
err , but the bug is that it fails *on boot* .
thats no surprise tbh , our chroots are not at all qt friendly
ohhh
also , when i merge latest overlay , i am now seeing the conflict : -p
looking at the packages , gnome-shell depends on gnome-session , which installs that file , which i *think* is what
^
it 's fun , right ? : )
it may be unfair to get a ticket on a highway for going at high speed , when usually no
i though bug triagers were able to propose nominations , just not to accept those
it 's hard enough without saboters ; -d
right , but if the image is a day behind and the silo got built against the overlay ppa your
our transaction simulation does n't actually work across collections
hah : d
that info is correct , lots of it is there but is hidden behind feature flags and/or not exposed to

well it should be fine
yeah
trusty
cool . i 'll do that next .
here , check this out ...
ack
one category == not expandable ; == expanded
seems its actually a post with that code : d
it is cool .
requested access
okay but i have the `` curl '' packag installed in latest version ( 7.35.1 ) i am using trusty
ok which gpu/driver ?
nothing in the log for the application on the guest ?
there were issues with the windows boot too , but with the live boot its only using ram not disk
ah , i wondered , cool thanx .
while initctl start nginx works ? ( both require sudo , mind )
bug # 1434991
i tried software settings but they are all for asus laptops . matching soundcard no idea , on windows it
depends on whether the data is cached
actually i can select the diffs , easier to review : )
it you follow the upgrade process properly the risk of a problem should be very low ,
perhaps
so you are trolling saying linux it 's crap ?
yeah , i suspect so
yes , i 've read those pages . i 'm quite happy for apps to be confined to certain directories
also , sdc uses an mbr partition table , not gpt
yep .
i am using a old version
now what was it you wanted me to do from here ?
there is a xorg for 15.04 ? that is a ppa and not supported is all .
that is not my proposal , actually
not until you lose data : )
is that sixteen `` blades '' with two storage boxes ?
mini.iso ? nothing wrong with them .
yap true
fails when trying to manually boot into it ... although thus far i 've only run it under kvm ,
that does n't change anything
run rsync verbosely to see what it 's doing .
looking at the log it fails with createplatformopenglcontext ... some issue with ubuntu-l.ttf ... ?
of course if yes
what 's the goal ?
which one is that exactly ? lem me run it here
which ubuntu are you on ?
hmm , that 's a really good point
but will ide mode perform good read/write speeds ?
maybe my tests broke in the past and i did n't notice because ci is broken for my branches (
what brand is this mate ?
what is the name of the package you are downloading
yeah .
do i get meetup.com support ootb there ?
so i 'm pulling this manually from the ec instance , and it 's doing `` stuff '' , but
and the updates worked
first i 've to get the ap-test written ... the nice to have 's is for people who actually know
searched the play store , there is an app called gtasks
well , i used my generator ; )
yeah ?
cool , glad to help , have a great day . ; )
welcome : )

do n't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly ; if nobody knows your answer , nobody will answer you
boo : )
and then you seek , truncate and write
that 's why we 're here !
did you make the phone read/write ?
np
well it 's the only maas we haver access to
if a system is intel+nvidia , and you disable nvidia , you still have to make sure that nvidia is
so to make it clear a last time now : the desktop-next iso is the one with the prototype of

i just saw your fix for mongo cert issue
yeah i know but all three browsers are buggy on 12.04
ptpp is defined in rfc 2637 from 1999 , written by microsoft , and has status as `` informational ''
subtle though .
did you write the channel command , to see all available channels for your device ?
just delete a couple of them so you have enough space to run apt-get
i 'd be interested in doing the general one afterwards
yep , kiosk mode
nope . feel free to read the man pages for both : )
i now but linux is linux
i am now on manjaro gnome , and i had some issues with some games in steam regarding pulseaudio ,
i found a command that supposedly determines whether the os is booted from efi or bios
you mean turn put into a toggle ?
lots do support dhcp+tftp ( as opposed to the bios `` pxe '' api ) , but yeah .
mount the partition under /mnt
if they *ship* the interpreter in the snap , is n't it ok to assume that they would also modify

long lines i am more comfortable defending
k
i do n't think so . removals are processed from debian , and from lp bugs ... it should be
ack . after i finish documenting the latest input bug i 've found .
any hints on how i can get to a bash session ?
and how do i turn on extents ?
i do miss you , but i 'm glad we were n't in the same room for the batting collapse
to chat from ubuntu to your wife on smartphone example
right mode ?
lol
what kind of problems are you having ?
4.4.4 ?
also with driver= show ?
maybe it 's the wrong iso ? ubuntustudio-14.04.1-dvd-amd64.iso
why did you add the build-dep on libjson-glib-dev ?
can you press both mouse buttons ?
ok , last time ( fingers crossed )
i dont have that .
that sounds as if some of the files/directories have characters in their names that are illegal on ntfs according to
maybe not modified , but self compiled for sure
so ... run-checks , tell me about this
ask someone who reads danish ? ?
yes i did that was the result
i have 400 installed , its just the store says i 380

so , just using it to proxy ?
what desktop environment , unity ?
yes yes yes
last thing , i swear : could you please tell me where i may get the place where you want
try sudo apt-get install -- reinstall compiz ubuntu-desktop
this package function is system configuration .
so what all things you do in h.w
if wines asks to remove it , it will probable be safe
akonadi is missing ppa tag
oh , ca n't use the rasppi drivers ? i thought they were accelerated ?
oh ?
any of the electrolytic can capacitors got obviously bulging tops , or signs of leakage around their base ?
oh great ! then please know that i felt really bad for losing your email .
although strangely when i reopened the clock app , the alarm that i tried to reenable is now activated..so it

the soundcloud scope uses three attributes on each card , for each one it only sets a `` value ''
i got a dedicated pc for it the testing of studio , just no way of actually accessing it
that 's fine . can i stick something in the calendar in jaunary ? when would be good for you
ah . k
perhaps a hangout with screenshare would be quicker here : )
nautilus can handle samba shares . just browse the network
right , but i meant on ubuntu ? i do n't expect problems , but i 'd like to get

nice , r=me .
i changed `` dns=dnsmasq '' to `` dns=none '' , but this just makes dns stop working completely
and you ca n't login . you 're on guest now ?
riddell next paycheck
nope , it 's missing qtquick2videosink
even if there are going to be some very common cases ...
scp , or network share
right . i 'm saying , remove the non-zero exit status bit ( it detected the loop i mentioned before
yup , okay good , moving on
sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/eggbot
/etc/issue and lsb_release reflect the new version .
glad to be of inspiration . : -p
well , it 's mostly new code
it is for linux
so if you want it to work , the patch would also be required in datetime-indicator
i 've commented on it , but imho it still does n't look trust worthy that juju has systemd support
not for me ...
so you 've got some kind of frankenputer stuck between versions ?
there 's no need for the chroot and for i.. that was for reinstalling grub or something
ok
from the boot.ini on sda1 , it looks like booting sda1 will lead you to windows 2003 server .
yeah
the .sh file will be run as superuser
i love it when a plan comes together .
a couple of tests remaining , one of which is windows specific and `` native '' to net-cli - bug
yes , it is
cool ! i read your email with the proposal and it 's awesome .
does it happen every time ?
it 's no big deal .
this your raid mess again ?
ack
done
why ?
and i used phone for find a fucking command for fix my laptop

yes , he is good at finding critical issues ...
hmm i thought i rejected the other upload .
oh , i assumed juju-core handled it .
bzr merge lp : ubuntu-calculator-app/reboot
i thought i remembered it being there , but i was n't sure
sent
yeah they lag youtube player ( html5 ) and both browser chrome and ff . chrome even flickers . but
can you port-mirror istack1 lan port on the switch to another system and check if istack1 is sending anything ?
si
yup
you need an lp person to look at that , maybe cjwatson ^
you install the package 'flashplugin-installer '

one of the weird situations when using git . sometimes i do n't really understand it
i am using 14.04 lts and waiting for 16.04 lts .
i 've just scrapped an old i7 920 , so do n't have anything intel to test/confirm your bug ,
any progress ?
laney , old one works fine for me
yeah , i figure that 's the issue that elopio brought up on the ml
right , thx
did you reboot the phone after insert the sim ?
15.10
: )
... either `` sh '' or `` terminal '' , depending on what you mean . ctrl-alt-f1 may work also
3.19.0-28-generic
yeah right , you can look up ok . the problem is with your router .
nevermind , i mis-looked

i 'd best get cracking on it then , there 's some embarrassing bugs
that automatically installs all packages needed for lamp . there are several of them and you can see them listed
you can run something against a remote branch by just specifying it . bzr tags lp : unity

any chance to hold that silo3 for a sec ?
the website
so finally ask your ubuntu related support question please .
in the menu , in the network manager . the gui . thats where i first address it
well , i know where it was , so really worthed a check : p
actually to be honest i havent been an admin since long before they started populating /proc with pids - since
i would expect mathematica to handle multiple cores well
no idea about that

you are not responding to help , what do we do now ?
how do you know ? i 'm curious so i 'm also able to see these things .
nope . i do know that it has to be blessed by ci first

afaik the only change was updating to the latest vivid yesterday
all using the open source driver ?
i 'm not a king !
`` stuff missing from the spreadsheet '' is not a scenario capable of surprising me .
and your servers talk to the mirrors using not an isp , but ... magic ?
landscape
but not all apps on android are supported on ubuntu touch , so its your decision
maybe try reloading your terminal after making that change
and gcc is the bad example as some packages are widely different
does that not work for you today ?
that is not sufficient detail
first try logging in using the guest account , if that works then it 's not a user issue
we do have an `` indicator team '' meeting in 30 minutes : - )
the `` top menu '' loads and i ca n't click on `` play movie ''

' xinput list ' does it come back with `` adb mouse '' , then your touchpad is old .
i assume the people suggesting that i reinstall it thought it would fix whatever script that is broken .
ah okay
maybe # codeblocks is a better channel to ask ?
if you use the width/height , you lose the dynamic resizing capabilities of the layout

primary and alternate is great .
what 's your launchpad id ?
yes they are on proposed

i have another physical router that i just plug and unplug from power
anything in the logs ?
no worry , i prefer that that me being totally out of any rationale understanding on why that was different
right ... that makes sense - that 's something i 'd need help with
any other time that would work for you ?

hey !
happy2help !
just mean using a boot cd ( install cd ) going into the `` try out linux '' mode then
if so , do n't .
huh ! ? ! ? ! ... that system is majorly messed up ! !
soon .
well , non-native could have been full source including debian/ dir in the vcs
booting doesnt tell anything about the state of the package system .
i have some abi-xxx files , some vmlinuz-xxx files too
derp . that was a thinko
or maybe the package names are not a hint at all ( gcc is a symlink or something like alternative
for events like you mentioned , it is teh app developer to do the proper serialization , i can not
we 're still waiting for that location-service silo that product team enforced
there are worse places
yeah that did the trick
me neither
i 'm not real sure yet . gon na ask in the dev chat
ok , so long as you land first thing tomorrow before we branch 1.23 : - )
runlevel 6 is reboot
this is n't live session
i have n't yet entered the world of scopes development ( yet )
you own two buildings ?
that and i used to program for the web

your first user can use sudo to get admin access when needed
it 's the first think i did but it 's not work
worth making sure getbalance is available to roo 's environment too
i had to trim them right back - they where racey as heck and some of them needed out of
this is very awkward , because dooferlad was reverting to unblock . so we can not revert his change .
have you thought about how private branches/repos and snaps might work ?
seems the bot is broke
but mark did announce that the first commercial device with some level of desktop convergence is likely to launch sometime
back in the dapper drake days when i started iso testing ... ... ... .
what 's the difference between xterm and terminal other than font ?
there was no bug . the bug was elfy being tired .
yeah..between admin and standard users
good . nice to see someone that has done the groundwork : )
its normal when we open up the blueman , a box with a message saying bluetooth switched off ! the
after we have this i guess i 'll start using your stuff to create a proper plugin that wraps all
do you think the diff is right ?
well , the biggest differences are of the `` overlayfs needs to pull some tricks to make overlay look like
that 's not possible . what are you trying to do ?
yep
that looks better : )
unlucky then
sort of to avoid random non signed pkgs distributed
just ask the channel
yep , i already have a fix for that - although `` correct device index '' is a bit arbitrary
your advice would be great , i have my pi2 snap but it seems like there is something wrong with

could it be because of live usb ?
if it 's important data , you can likelly recover .
does 1.2 work ?
and it starts fine if i start it manually .
well , `` newbie '' questions do n't necessarily come from new users/developers . but if the question could be
no , google defines the startup environment for android . they could 've just specified uefi and acpi back then
probably
i gots to try that cleaning thing if the bottom comes off nicely
thats my thinking as well , : )
let me just confirm this is what 's happening
sure rhythbox works fine : )
it might also be in the custom shortcuts
until recently , the head of charm.v5 had other issues that made it impossible to merge
i believe you were using wubi . xubuntu does n't support wubi .
help me help you..
and i said already : with not much ram , see if running lubuntu is better
anyway i 'm afk now
alright
but had some codec dependency issue

`` dev '' ?
yesterday i 've spent about 4 hour on one level : d
i believe everyone tried to help , and asked it not be addressed again , is this correct ?
np
however ...
do you know more ? ^ can we land account-polld via the citrain ?
for the usbstick of for the filesystem on the hdd ?
no i do n't have it on ubuntu 15.04
no , must be the new uefi thing or secure boot on windows , my bios does not have those
bzr : error : no workingtree exists for `` file : ///home/aaron/documents/kubuntu/ubiquity-mine/.bzr/checkout/ '' .
the entire build only took 1.5 minutes , so the timeout ca n't be that long

open system settings > search > file search , uncheck `` enable file search ''
let 's just agree that % # v is the correct fix : )
how to do that ?
what about if you login to guest mode ?
are you trying to get information that your bind9 server is authoritative for and that also another domain is authoritative
there are really an infinity of things that can go wrong
maybe the # ubuntu-devel guys are more expert in this ?
solution : mini-iso , that requires an internet connection , to install the desktop
you have it tomorrow morning then
i doubt it . better to get the facts whats going wrong and solve that . no need for reinstalls
subsequent requests , check if the stored default is an exact match - if it is *always* use it
try clicking that .
also : after moving .kde and .config , still only some of the settings are backk
and even with the english category , the post is not listed
^
i thought i had checked the 'nova list ' after the 'destroy-environment ' and saw only the 2 sandbox ones
so after talking to bfiller we agreed that it was better not to get both fixes on the same silo
it switches me to a lock screen on vt8
do you have the restricted repo enabled/
yup , and it 's runnable in theory in kubuntu 15.10 too , i just do n't believe it 's
but wrt where to file , it 's indicator-sound
maybe we can recycle this bug report for this ? i 'm happy to update the description
not really
do you have a /swap ?
good luck with it , i know how infuriating and time consuming it can be
keep it simple , stay static with just the bare minimum
oh its as simple as that ... do i then just run my normal apt-get commands to reinstall the things
how do i launch synaptic from the terminal > ?
all is ok ?
no you can not . that simple and practical feature was not built first : (
how long it should take ?
looking in the snapcraft.yaml file , all of the sources pointing to the github . they are not local..
one thing i 've learned for years now ! ! ! never put your life into work stuffs ( laptops

the problem is at a lower lever than you think .
you do n't need winetricks on pol
if youre viewing 720 or 1080 clips on youtube then that system might struggle
what 's the command again ?
oh sorry , i mis-read the name . i thought it was the qtmir branch you were mentioning
ahh , that should explain that problem .
does that make it fast enough for simply looping to be feasable ?
and additional drivers ?
ack
so what did you change , exactly ?
good idea
and was this something you 'd formatted in windows ?
\o/ happy to help
excellent description . in this case waiting then
ok , that 's ok : )
so all this time i did n't have my home encrypted ?
intel
well we do n't really discuss or congregate around distros but yes there should be ,
why not just use curl ?
oh , chipaca has an mp
hmmm ; was n't aware they had luks format capabilities
yes , pastebin it please and give us the url to your paste .
i 've never been involved with operating system dev . what would be some initial opportunities ?
clean means it 's good
i write to console what u say and i get this and clear etc/shadow file
yes
the builders it 's failed on today are vms : - )
but he wants to test it on utopic , you are scaed it might break your 14.10 ? : )
so what should i do step by step to get my desktop back ?
for ubuntu gnome , gdm is default .
i removed the previous partitions . but when i tryed to create a 1 mb partition it says it 's
this is the community ubuntu support . yes
yes , the problem is that with r/o the fakeroot is not properly installed .
yeah
sure , np
sure thing , are you interested in pointing out the supported hardware video codecs ?
hey
thx .
if all 3 drivers arent performing , i would try lts or file a bug against your ubuntu version
wadda trussin issue ? 8 { }
fun fun fun fun
what ?
or consider upgrading to 14.04
there 's a fix in vivid-proposed
what do you think would be the best approach ? disconnect hd1 , fix problem and then once all good
if things go wrong you can try install lubuntu-desktop from recoverymode terminal
with my limted knowledge about human anatomy ... no , i doubt : )
hehe
saw the theme change ochosi suggested ?
and because i was n't thinking , if you just skip the -d , it 'll give you files too
guess i 'll file a bug against dput-ng
also the freezes seems to occur with chromium .
i 'm not familiar with that , but newer kernels are more relevant for up to date bleeding edge desktop
because the dt does n't export the hw
sound good : )
the root user has no password by default , so you would n't be able to login if you had
there were a couple i linked , the parole bug that was an ubuntu only issue that would n't allow
what did you find ?
yeah always got ta ride like your not seen i agree .
no but he was arround earlier
that 's worrying
i can probably just fix that directly
i bet there 's a small slot for the bt module but it is n't fitted . you could open
`` there is currently no kit defined for your device ''
and that should be fine -- install-data rule installs *.gmo as *.mo
ah , ok ; as it would never actually start under upstart on a desktop ( start on started dbus
for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /run /sys ; do sudo mount -b $ i /mnt $ i ; done
did you use add-apt-repository to add the ppa ?
with 4 gb you can not sleep/hybernate .
it broke a few things , but a yum install ifconfig worked well
well , look into application manager code and how it queries things from upstart or what not . and/or why
i 'm not even trying to boot . i just tried to check if the .iso file was good by
which channel exactly rc-proposed/ubuntu ?
i can give you a shell script that will trigger the formerly-leaking code
i c. that 's what my question was .
i meant the meeting : )
run the terminal app
i do n't have an opinion on that , seems a bit complex for the meeting , maybe you can
startup - shutdown > sddm
i already have other things for nm in to-do for tomorrow , so i will debug this too
ok. so what happens when you run autoremove ?
odd
note , there 's also these errors when i run journ . timed out waitinf for device , dependcy failed
i have tried that xd
yes , or run the smartd to check it for you .
rebooting ?
wth are you doing answering irc now anyway ?
pretty much
tbh reflashing seems to fix it
feel free to file a bug against account-polld about that
i ca n't recall if there 's a handy switch for the resolver interface to ignore aaaa responses.. i could
i mean the scopes are c++ iirc ? ... i just wonder if it would be useful even just have

oh weird , when i was looking at that it did n't show the full log , it looked like
also
notwithstanding any rebuilds - there 's been one already and i 'm expecting another
yes
it 's awesome already
i know i 'd love to just stay on devel , but i thought i 'd try the lxc route
well , the problem is that grep gives like a gazillion results ... hence i asked in what file that

well being a webdev then you know that looks are a matter of taste first of all
ah ... verification-failed on that one..

i 'm using nvidia-340.76 to drive 3 gpus on a laptop ( one internal mobile , one external dual-gpu nvs-420
oops . i pasted the wrong link .
windows is a nightmare to fix , the updating system ( i.e whilst turning the machine on or off is
how long is the train ?
i would try flashing an amd64 image onto a nuc and see what happens
will test in a vm environment before trying on my production system
but you can already see that code completion works nicely
commented on it
ive tried 3 cables
*mix
i mean : sure , no problem
you 'll get there , eventually
`` sudo '' makes you the boss of it .. preceed your copy commands with the term `` sudo ''
units are on machines , machines are on networks / have interfaces - and those networks / interfaces have subnets
wrt the other issue , what you call sub properties are members of variants and unfortunately totally do n't work
so anyway - balloons is a bit < balloons > hhmm . so you want more reporting
we 're still chatting about it
ahah , enjoy ! : )
i just made it public
do not copy & paste it into that file , but execute it in a terminal .
^
tell me when your 're there
because ? this is in maas-spaces . i was just doing some testing before submitting a pr for the script
ty !
go to the bios and select legacy , then boot the live usb , when it boots make sure ls
i know it 's at the top . chrome does n't show it on 14.04 like it did on 12.04
( translation : how can i make it so the build failure is the debian maintainer 's problem and not
i 'll mail them to you
no . it 's curious because it 's just some sites .
yep : )
which part are you referring to ?
no fresh install
do you want me to package up an artwork update soon ?
yes the whole caboodle
masaccio : well , portuguese , but yeah ...
yes , it 's in overlay ppa now . see also the patch description if it helps you understand what
words fine for me
so 'less my.cnf ' ?
so thats not going to work
yeah , that would be awesome : )
no one cares for openjdk in any case , only distros
you are missing the php module for apache .
ah yes you 've nailed it - it says bad listen address 192.168.0 . *:631 at line 16
in where ?
i hate those tests
hwe = hardware enablement stack of utopic most likely , so probably has the 3.16 kernel
i agree . at least it has given me the opportunity to learn about ssl certificates and got me thinking
for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run ; do sudo umount /mnt $ i ; done
any good ?
no
/var/lib/update-manager/
no
dunno , lots of things , i guess
often depends on the bs setting . paste the command
i got a mail about a possible s-c-p regression from some error report bot which you are running .
whole pointless os
and why is that ?
surely that would not work ... is n't that what kalikiana was saying ? they are floats ... and we
if you are on vivid do you use the ppa ?
yeah , i 'll try to remember what that was about ; p
to kmail
i guess i can fix the issue by replacing oncountchanged with onmodelchanged
i am adopting the kdeocrationv5 change from debian
it 's a cross-platform messaging app . android , ios , windows , mac , linux
nother plade to look for config files ' /etc/x11/xorg.conf.d ' .
yes
the /topic suggests updates are getting rolled out
k
makes sense to me . testing it now
the overlay has pin-priority of 1001 , and the silo has 1100
the standard way
certainly things like movies you want on the hdd
let me try
plug it in , wait 10 seconds , and then pastebin the output of `` dmesg ''
sorry , i misunderstood your question , yes , it works by default
popey himself will likely get to it before me : )
dual boot/
so what debian does should actually work fine ?
remove that and restart sddm ?
not the scope of this channel , and not cool
iirc applications seem to try to remove display on requests that they never issued.. and that caused usc to restart
any time estimate on when you 'll be branching ?
ahh , cool , i did n't think to look there ... assumed they were using launchpad . this is
yes
good : )
< 3 . on this topic , any new update from django upstream ?
do u know programming languages
you didnt specify the mount point . you would run : sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
hmm k : p
cool , ca n't help myself just trying to get the right info here for one that can .
but it does .
just disable the output
yes , install grub
also , if you 're using cifs/smb then samba/netbios/winbind could enter the mix
i mean that i.e . you have to copy-paste a text with hyperlinks in it . you want that these
you still could not log in ?
or are you still looking at the ubuntu mate seeds ?
i aspire to be that diligent , but i always get trapped in the `` gosh can this really be
master , headphon , speaker , pcm , mic , mic boos , s/pdif , beep , auto-mut , internal
: d
in the end everything has to run well enough
that 's ok , it is just that we can start testing it
yes i do have
what the hell ? how many networks are you running ?
yes . maybe , make an annotation on the moztrap doc saying that it is automated but the security still
it should you be swap . it seems that i ca n't unmount it .
yes - but we 're possibly going to see people using the lts
: -/
overall system speed lags or bottleneck ?
okay i 'll give that a shot
yup 32 bit
wow , option rom from isa 8088 days
type sudo apt-get install dh-modaliases execstack dpkg-dev debhelper
did upstream say anything on the issue/what should change ?
those are kernel updates mate
got it i will restart the system
humm , it should work fine , but since the shell is starting in full-greeter mode ( by default )
ok , cool . if you ca n't manage to get there , feel free to add the proposed solution
it certainly worked on sailfish with the original box2d version , so doubt there 'll be any problems for the
that 's not a problem with webmail
so is this openvpn or a cisco vpn ?
xinput float will disable the device , xinput reattach < id > < master > will enable it , <
apparently the car is modeled to ridiculous reality
will i have access to the filesystem ?
sounds like it 's not even configured to use a port , perhaps read up on what you installed and
aside from downloading hostapd , there has been no real advice
what about using 'unionfs ' or something similar instead of just unpacking a copy of the '/ ' ?
ghouls need bodies .
what output to do get from /etc/init.d/nginx status ; ?
however , as a incremental improvement , we can make our tests better around checking if the environment supports address
\o/ i 'll hold you on to this though : p
can you please try it now ?
i can confirm in a bit though
not the os
and am trying to see if i 'm alone or if there are workarounds or what
it is making me install pastebin yet again
which line ?
also if it helps , this laptop authenticated fine from windows when it was still installed that same day
try ctrl+c
oh wow , that worked . awesome
sorry : p
i 'd like to make all of it unnecessary , will propose debian to make console-setup-freebsd arch : kfreebsd-any .
at least it 's fixed on ppc . : p
i 've also tried with and without nomodeset .
starting your compiz with unity_log_severity= '' < root > error ; unity.key.gnome.grabber=debug '' should give you more infos
nice . i 'll have a look
again ; mille grazie
good point
you want it back to wrong ? : p
try the nomodeset f1 and choose livemode from there maybe
listmodel is a very dumb thing
i have . error code .
+1 to bashing-om 's suggestion , i 'd focus on making some live media if you can

that 's what 's needed ^
ta . releasing them all , then .
sbuild does it fine in wily too .
oh i know , but a guy can be hopeful right ?
the gps chipset driver requests a so-called xtra download from us
that sounds like an useful option to add to the snappy setup script anyway , so bug report appreciated

are there tweaks in the bios for that ?

ok silo 35
ah , your not a new user , you have to go one by up in upgrades , if not
i guess so , except when folks say jes in my head i always think - one or more server
oh ... hahahaha ... i am always that hyper if not more xd
same error . however , i have extra line in the kmsg wich tell me that the crash is mmc
seems suspicious
what will be the generated revert version ?
well clock app did not migrate to uc 1.2 yet and alarms still work on vivid for it .
cheers
can you execute the binary manually or does it give you the same error ?
well , i can approve for sure , and i 'm not in any of the 2 teams
meh , i have a few repros that are still labelled `` precise '' . not had any issues
ok sudo update-grub
i have before ... some bios can do it
use the installer , there 's an option to do a complete full install that replaces everything
do you have dconf-editor
done ! : )
just notice in that link you have to log out and log in to take effect : p
i can wait , i 'm just asking cause i 'm confused
oh ... perhaps
do you have some estimation for the bug fix ?
pardon ?
is it dimmed right now or you want it dimmed ?
great , ty
that is what my patch does ...
do you have the 340 also , ( not updates )
i tried to google if i could find an error like that relating to kwallet but there is very little
ubuntu 14.04 , this is the ubuntu chat right ? unity
iwconfig
instead , let 's route all criticals to apport
it has eog at least , what else was missing ?
oh , proxying
did you look into your home dir if e.g . you have the locale variables defined in .bashrc ?
i gotcha . i still just get a command line though .
haha , ok : )
yea -- i can probably probably hack together something using any number of languages.. any idea where those values are
okay , let me take a quick look at 1.24.5
from what i know the soonest qa can resume silo sign-off would be tomorrow
which version of maas is that ?
lets hop on a hangout and riff over your use cases
strange thing is , i have another box with an uptime of 267 days , with 90mb swap and 9gb
that is a consequence of the display manager stopping and then starting the x server
same reason most houses still have deadbolts ? or credit cards mostly use mag stripes
no , i missed that .
wich one ?
i see . that sounds bad , since the laptop is brand new and i prefer to run linux or
there is a difference in the env variables , of course .
great
ask your ubuntu question
im idling # gamingonlinux lately , alot of usefull linux grafix realtime discussions there
none of that is important
what 's the use case for this ?
think i 'll poke the sdk guys when their about
am i ?
( why would you cd to the dir to make the .pid ? )
so relation.peeker is an alternative to a hooksender for using a hooksource

did you check the output of the commands above ?
how so ? it is from the same developer
does the resolution that ubuntu chooses by default was not good for you ?

pushing to qas still works , and qas has the split ...
alright , if i installed radeondriver would it fallback to mesa ?
it even has helpful comments along the way : )
no
okay , well , in the forking world , easy enough , as above .
is it normal for -*dbgsym*.ddebs to be listed as new packages ? ( me has no idea , cause well
hmm ok so 346 , that 's fine as long as nvidia-settings says all is good .

how did it use both ?
well , i maintain that code so i would highly prefer to see it work ; - )

windows and usb etc
you do n't do much networking ? : )
there are examples , but i 'm trying to find a recent one given the syntax has changed a bit
that was weird

whats the default os on that hp ?
the update - > rollback - > update - > rollback ... went well for amd64 , from 16 to

i do n't care about 5.1/5.2
second , from the above i understand that you have been able to adb in to the phone
you could correct it if you know , you can include it in the description - if that 's what
well , yeah , that means you ca n't rely on the tool in general
tvoss is looking into it ... most likely a dbus-cpp issue
that 's expected if they work correctly . most linux tools only get verbal if something goes wrong
not much besides if i install unity it un installs gnome-monitor
so cabling isnt your issue .
they only put the major version ( 8 ) into the package name
what happens with usb boot , again ?
okay , all one partition , or did you make multiple ?
un is ok ... can you paste dpkg -l |grep ibgcrypt*
no , i do n't think so . i have already checked my java version , paths , told ubuntu
yes . so for casual users . non-lts releases are n't great
that test seems wrong
probably a sed command and | uniq will do it
is that because of my rebase ?
yes , it should skip updating from that repository on this occasion
i wonder about when can i get the certificate mail from canonical .
it could have been `` mount : mounting uuid=dee2-1cc0 on /boot/efi failed : no such file or directory ''
no in general
nah , it 's too late by then . proposed-migration should n't land any packages from a silo until all
ok i have some problems with opengl , drivers etc

you call stop ( )
ubuntu-drivers list gives me no answer
we have no idea what you did
wireshark is the new ethereal
in fact the only mention in the kernel of that manufacturer id ( acs 0x072f ) is for the pn533
you can drop the apparmor stuff if you convert it to a systemd unit
katco xwwt bug 1451674 is the last blocker . ci can not test it yet .
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
you could maybe make a kwin rule to work around it
no hurry , but would be nice to get that change applied in debian , could be done in may
i would say send it to the apparmor list for review
refresh your sheet : p
did you install it via repo ?
and in your tests you just type `` import source 1.0 ''
do you setup ntp or some sort of tool ?
they are just shortcuts to what we were used to

no , all went well
though it might . i completely forgot i had a firewall between me and my server . ; )
if you cick on the upgrade it clearly shows that 15,04 is not lts , i grant you the link
i 'd say the oinous is on the charm author
no the client would never be aware of it . it 's all shell handled
not yet deprecated , but qmlproject has no build config ... so it is a bit dumb
yes
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
when you check/uncheck , can you look if whoopsie-preferences is running ?
i use a different user account to remove my users config from the equation ... its literally quite trivial to

that is all i wanted to know .
the latest one i 've got installed is -62
enjoy your meal and do n't be distracted by us here
all using the same server and upgraded the same , say with a dist-upgrade ? two questions here
services like cron , acpi and all with description
why do n't you tell us the real problem ?
?
so i m getting problems in installing it from source code . i mean after proper installing json-c . can
ubuntu 14.10 , pepperflashplugin works without sudo update-pepperflashplugin-nonfree
as long as the job has the right definition '**/test*xml ' for example .
it only really matters if you open the chroot manually ( via schroot ) and muck around in there
you can just remove unity for xfce on your current installation
it doesnt happen all the time , just randomly
i ca n't see any non-doctests .
on the right side does it say xorg.0.log ?
o right
: ) by the way , is there a changelog for the `` core '' apps , i.e . ``
get the list , parse it , and xargs reinstall it
it does n't restart , it starts and stops
do we have any dist-upgrader hook to install systemd-sysv ?
ok
i mean ... my question is ... where does the delay come from ?
more more more !
i found the documentation less than helpful . i had to look through the whiskermenu source code for documentation .
it 's offering to get the propritary modules it needs
i have n't pinged people yet , but i could do that - and send a mail with links to
it says is up-to-date
yup , that should be entirely seperable .
you can build from source , then
what happens when you cold boot
k
never mind . what 's the full output of `` file -s /dev/sdd ''
ok that should work . let me check this under upstart as well and switch to service command then .
let me do it once after the meeting
qsg_renderer_debug=render gives shed loads . cant remember the simple one..
ok , so the quickest way :
also , to answer your question - i needed the path mostly to fit a thumbnailer call in an external
that may or may not still happen , but as it 's syncd into all of the other os-charms ,
or just plug in ethernet after 2 mins : - ) i 'm merely interested what 's ( not )
tey were fraught with problems but so is the current system . they sold it by putting a select few
because i have problem with the deploy of my bundle ,
i clicked the reconfigure link from the spreadsheet and it took me to a page that had 'build ' at
and if you have specific wishes/suggestions , at least i do n't care if you submit them as issues in
: (
yeah , you 're right
thats 32bit ?
and is it working with the newer one ?
that 's not quite clear to me
so i 'm wondering if adding displaycommand= '' path_to_my_script '' in the xsetup script would work
that sounds as though it cross-cuts mir , qtmir and unity8 . there 's some work in mir that will
it would help to determine what to call based on what you discover
i do n't think it likes seeing both cards .
i would recommend going to uappexplorer.com and sort apps there using the rating to find the one you like
oh , neat
but there must be a folder in home also , like in cache there is for cantata for the cache
you mean unpacking onto disk ?
np
what url are you on ?
yep , 06:30 train !
also , what 's this patch for ? rhythmbox itself ?
how do i delete all the directories within a directory ?
k , lem me take a look at the structure first .
it 's 19:00 utc in my calendar but i 'll ask on mail .
dependin on the metadata version on the md , either mdraid09.mod or mdraid1x.mod
if there is a launchpad team , i 'd like to join it .
ah okay .

and ubuntu is not a rolling release .
do you get any messages ?
you need more then the kernel , you need a complete android aosp tree
hello sgclark
so i *would* try -- debug if i could get it to stop
did it work before ?
ok. i was n't sure if it was using the one on the host or in the vm for that
maybe xenial will have nice plasma features ?
next ?
i have a couple of thruk charms to throw charmers way once i get tests added
i disabled all for

apt-get install freeglut3
ooh , new toys !
although - sysvinit-utils is not essential in ubuntu , so that 's a buggy lintian warning . but perl will

quick fix before you go crazy : sudo cp /usr/share/konsole/default.keytab /usr/share/kde4/apps/konsole/
if its a one off thing you can go into the grub menu and append `` systemd.log_level=debug '' ( or
can you adb shell into it ?
could you pastebin the output of 'sudo parted /dev/sdx print ' where x is the letter of the usb stick
cheers ! the important part is that now we can filter nics by `` attachment.instance-id ''
i figured it out ... stupid oversight on my part .
ok builds fine now
an official way ?
i 'm not seeing the kmail screenshot to which you refer ?
`` go build : -race is only supported on linux/amd64 , darwin/amd64 and windows/amd64 ''
should i try gnome 3 ?
are you using google or is google using you ? dundundu . ; o )
i tried it with mesa
that is the issue we needed your input on
i dont say it is fine to have bugs in wily ... i warn people that they are treated lower
dolphin4 was not installable because i screwed up the version in the breaks
8.1 was n't released at the time
well , true
much obliged !
when the train runs the clean target , your script will run that generates your control file .
thats a leftover from the oem team hackage in live-build/livecd-rootfs
the fix i used to correct the tearing in 14.04 completely breaks plasma
normally qtc should show the tab by default

basically it should just work , any config is only a risk that may make stuff break
i am running in pure text environment

i am at home , in front of my desktop its 1 am here at my place
there 's your problem
is that under updates - > pre-released updates ?
yes , cause they are not very tech savvy , would be very difficult to explain things to them

it 's insignificant unless you have kdbus-dkms , pretty much .
they can all be installed and given as options when you boot .
you did a great job : d
just edit the `` data : = ... '' line
i can deploy juju-gui to lxc , baremetal , or kvm , no mater what it wont display my environment
nah , not sleeping . should be . i 'm working on some xml crap with sed .
np
yes . i can reproduce it with a one-line main ( ) call to syslog
you can check their database online

i thought about it , but that has disadvantages too
i 'm pretty sure it will be , as -ckt11 should be released with the fix
i 've even tried reinstalling from the store

ok so you are not the only user with root access
do you see the device now ?
check the xda forums for more projects , the nexus devices are the most supported devices for the moment
could it be that the ubuntu kernel is a bit modified and i should try a `` clean '' kernel

the problem is that the oculus screen is basically unusable when there are not oculus application running on it so
makes sense to use appropriate technologies
package nvidia-173 is not available but is referred to by another package this may mean the package is missing ,
probably written before they settled on the other scheme . oh well . better to be consistent .

no worries
if the device runs ubuntu desktop , questions belong here
assuming it 's a system with systemd-sysv installed .
you could split it into two . do the first task ( that has a dependency on the rest )
help ! channel emergency ! ( only use this trigger in emergencies ) - pici , myrtti , jrib ,
no idea which one i need . bitcoin-qt installation only pointed out that libdb is needed .
and access.log is empty
the activities page will try to round that out a bit .
the only thing i see there that makes me wonder , is that you 're running the command from the
so i guess it depends if you would consider a patch using a different env variable conditionally - that would
like mir
yeah , i 'm working on the assumption that any breakage would be very obvious .
`` acpi pcc probe failed '' is expected and can me ignored ; it 's just an info message that

cyphermox is having a look - maybe hangfire on reporting bug till we know more about what to report against
we did find an error in pinning on trusty not that long ago which might account for these , so
yes just drop any flags that error
i also tried my old graphics card ( ati 5000 something ) which i purchased in 2011. would you expect

another solution mzanetti just proposed
hold shift when the pc boots and if you get a screen with a menu press f6 and choose nomodeset
yes.. you would reboot , and look in the bios settings *before* the operating system boots
fginther is looking into the wily part i believe
it works now on his fresh install , 340 + nvidia-prime

thats awesome.. thx bro
correct ; although the port 80 count is not increasing , and nor is my remote host count for 2a02:8011:2007
well you can hold all packages but the kernel . you could also just use the mainline kernel ppa to
where exactly ?
but dont act on the /dev/sd devices , that are your hard disc , so select the /dev/mmc stuff
if you can verify that i 've got the screenshots looking right , but also i have some questions on
this is not very helpful
just start fresh , make a backup of the old account and configure it manually
check the manual
oh , do we do per-library paths in apparmor ? /me checks
yeah i can do that
and that would be because tests themselves depend on upstart , not the packages ?
you 've said that

why not ? package not found ?

i might as well try
source ~/.bashrc
ah that sounds real : -/
talking about the checksum of the dvd you downloaded
i wonder if this machine has multipath or not ?
yeah like i say , things worked like a charm before on trusty
just my bit to try and help : ) .
i published it : p
the update happens before rebooting .
the only other 'hiding ' possibility is the posix namespace issue , on that page i linked you to it
because they dont have a mobile ui
type sudo apt-get install lvm2
ah , otherwise everything would have had to return int ?
is there another project which similar logic , which i might use as inspiration ?
i see that sometimes on our retracers ( invalid core dumps )

first i have to figure it out how to install ubuntu snappy on my router : d
the files grub will create in /boot/efi/efi/ ...
i also cleared /var/cache/lxc/cloud-precise
that bug is nothing to do with how the usb was made
use the current driver , you would have less 3d effects and such
it would have been a sync
i 'll leave it up to you to either update your trusty vm or just use 'wily ' as string
have n't had the default wallpaper yet , is that a problem for you ?
he used to work here a while ago , before i started
so in effect you can switch to whatever profile you want , or none at all
ah , nevermind ; looks like it just did n't identify the failing voting test at the top of the
maybe its a known issue on n4 ?
upstart is on its way out already
it 'll land upstream differently because they 're doing some other configure changes
lets start a hangout now
would you be able to test it , to see if it actually fixes the issue ?
ok ill try that , it sounds like the least hassle
`` find some time '' ... thats the problem here : )
record a call ?
security & privacy
yeah , that one was only updates for iwlwifi
are you ok with my doing the same in apparmor ? : )
if heat still builds up , you got hardware issue . else revert the changes ( back to ondemand )
can you tell silo-13 that landed on 18th march , what it fixed
never . windows and ubuntu only .
i arrived to the point when adding the module , the modal window opens and the list is empty .
but on the other hand , you should generally always file a new report and leave it to the develoeprs
you can do , sudo apt-get install steam -- reinstall
textfile busy should be sorted now that we stop things properly , mehtinks
are you needing support to intall ubuntu-server ?
i just typed the command . it just goes blank and returns to thsi guest session
so it 's just a matter of if it does what you want it to do : -b
wait for it to process , then go and edit ! ! ! bug 1488660
why not just run the live image as it comes ?
might be try with -- purge option
i guess i do n't really understand why they exist or are available then ?
cve-2014-2653 is what they listed
nothing bad happend . i have built new computer and placed the drives there . since i couldnt find the
sorry my bad , yes , i see what you mean now
look at /etc/issue
ah ok , so its just the repository key that has changed ?
if we want cgroup support for those sessions , yes .
never .
yeah , so maybe we want a helper that wraps tomb.kill in tomb.kill ( errors.cause ( err ) )
reason i updated was because i was following advice to update my kernel to resolve disappearing cursor issues in xubuntu
so , i need confirmation from bdmurray , but i 'm fairly sure with the `` hybrid '' signature we

hrm , that 's weird . maybe ubuntu is behind somewhere . : (
if the software you want the language changed for is something like firefox or another non-qt application , you still
yes , i 'll probably be head down in scopes tutorials until thursday , but that sounds like a plan
no , to deploy a charm
well , the box in that error message does say it all really
cool , will do . thought it might be x , clearly i was wrong
and mine includes all maas charms < 3 ; )
just working through the current set of proposed changes
good to know , and i do n't feel super strongly about it , just some git ocd you know
what are you actually trying to achieve ?
first world problems ...
^
are you using smb ?
just make sure your upstream remote for juju uses an anonymous checkout instead of a ssh one
well by now i 've learned to take shortcuts as early as possible ; )
i knew about that , but i do n't use it - i just prefix the command with a space
oups , what happened ?
sure , i 'll push the code
i pasted it the link above
tbh the only cli tool i used for partition is fdisk and mk*
good luck
so i am stuck with it
would like to point that person to the `` set runtime preferred orientation '' bug
yes , i have it since before the update
just ask away
`` apt-file list mtp-tools '' tells me there several command-line tools in there , and man-pages , for manually manipulating
in the pricerow
: )
well qt with kde libraries
you could try kvm , i can personally confirm that kvm works ; )
`` sudo parted -l '' hanging again ?
the first mvp will be able to take a url for an image , trigger test runs in jenkinses controlled
that 's correct
i do n't think so
if that is what your attempting to do.. i will load my test enviroment for vivid and simulate what your
is he on irc ?
right , and it 's there
yep
this would need a separate integration suite where we start the vm with a different oem .
when fullscreen , you can still go top-edge-swipe for the panel
install click-reviewers-tools , and then run click-review /path/to/file.snap
root root
it was a great thought , but unfortunately my findings contradict that . i changed it to wpa2 only ,
then why would it run fine on it 's own
that seems to work ( bashing-om : it did n't list that )
magnificu
to set the device class appropriately
3.16.0-31-generic < -- is that what you are asking for ? : )
: d
believe you 'd use bzr bisect move for that ( but a bit manual )
for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run ; do sudo mount -b $ i /mnt $ i ; done
sorry back
ok i 'll look in a minute
what to do next ?
it will depend , per application , what is here.. as in , there is no `` file '' menu
yeah , that too .
hm ?
how do you typically run tests on devices ? i presume you are ssh'ing into them or something ?
ah , right , with wait_select_single the timeout is not needed . well , there 's one but the default
i dont see any more errors
at least in phase one
basically the orange boxes lag behind stable a bit and they got bit by it it seems to me
sec ...
why are you manually trying to install packages which arent in the repo for your release ?
when i upload the package
generally , but this is a startup item , so it changes to `` only start in ''
ok , that makes sense , i thought your were trying to land a change to charm helpers
on aug 11 ?
it appears like you intend the type of factory.envparams.owner to change but i do n't see that
unusual things , kernel panic , firmware bugs , etc
lol
think launchpad
so other than the testcase not reading right to you - any other issues that you think are real ones
i installed it after then , so i do n't think so ... maybe we could install one ... or
could you please name the widget and if possible how to install it
yea , but not on her old phone
but if i must ...
the boot sequence does n't finish , so whatever systemd uses instead of inittab wo n't matter
so better do n't do it if i am not very sure what i am doing ?
patches welcome ! ; ) -
no .
they are very slow in response ... they took 3 , 4 days to reply
yessir !
3.13.11 is dead upstream , we 're the new maintainers , however for political reasons , we do n't maintain
hehe
hah , that should work : )
i did reboot . when i logged back in it was the different settings again .
it seems yes ... my mako is notrebooting ... what channel you use for mako ?
sounds reasonable , though
i just read somewhere that it needs to be enabled in windows first .
once i had a connection i installed the broadcom drivers from the additional drivers tab .
did you have a moment to comment ?
: p
you should address the whole cc with that question , please
( that handle vlans )
m smiling in disappointment
as you wish . i vote for the ban staying for a while .
i would think just preparing the fs outside , and then trying to mount it in the instance , bear
note i do n't actually know what the correct branch would be . if there is n't one , we
what are you trying to do ?
but manually checking i would expect to work
for tablet nexus7 works pretty nice
does it use /usr/share/upstart/sessions/unity8.conf like on the phone ? even though desktop is now systemd
why is it being called when the widget is n't rendered there ?
cking : in that case it would really be the gpu driver
do we want thunar .5 ?
in which one ? qtmir or unity8
hmm , ok , good idea - will ask them
poking fun ?
aka kevin brubeck , ?
yeah , your $ path was n't correct so you had to include the full path to the command to
the idea is that when you reboot , or run 'sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart ' , it will run the script
maybe worth reinstalling ca-certificates with a dry-run ?
i 'll also drop the rsyslog.dmesg.upstart job
have you seen the ubuntu terminal reboot ?
ho in 30 '
feel free to dupe it against something new
you did read the topic , the one about how this is a support channel for ubuntu
well , you can try contact the maintainer , i see that he have some recent update on his launchpad
might just move it to there though ...
i will make a -dev package too now
i am asking you questions to understand what has changed on your system - as it 's clear you 're
i 'll re-review in the queueue for sanity , but all looks good to me .
great . `` sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/ ''
done
is their a flight from amsterdam to nuremberg ? or heathrow ? then this may be better .
panic ye not : )
tyvm !
well if you 're booted into linux ... then you have to have a home folder `` in place ''
i have . i also tried switching to gdm
i already been there , but i 'll run that again just in case . brb
ok , type for i in /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/* ; do echo -e `` $ i\n '' ; cat /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d ; done
might be best to check paterux does have that setting already . i *think* the update-initramfs run on the chroot
is /proc/self/cgroup still showing / for most controllers ?
afaict the only difference is helpers.ensuredir does not fail with error if the path exists and is not a directory
^
did you try re-installing it
it does success though
yeah , if both are successful you 've a better chance of bootstrapping ok
was n't the best idea in hindsight : )
after reading 100+ forum threads about nvidia , optimus , bumblebee , nvidia prime , primus ... i have no
are you a parrot ?
sudo apt-get install pastebinit
make your life easy and loose win10 once and for good , single boot ubuntu
boot the live usb , let 's see the errors and maybe do a quick fsck
get a book , build some projects
because you need `` -b '' to force the step
unfortunately , some gifs have a variable frame rate , which is why i would like an average . however
is there anything in /etc/fstab ?
yeah , ota-7 will be the first stable image to ship with this framework
yes , and they work
well , it could still be that logind re-evaluates active at startup ( which would make sense )
it should charge from the wall socket , but might not from a pc , there is working going into
now removed
yes
ok , the error is quite selfexplaining . what about you run the windows and let it fsck the partition
no .
see if that works
pretty much , in my experience they 're close enough anyway . especially if you 're trying to go more
yes
ok , how the hell can i get rid of these 403 problems ? ? ?
how can i tell ? : )
no idea , do n't do much with php here ; )
i 'm not a penguin
can jhodapp 's silo 021 get qa priority when ready for qa testing ( should be soon ) ? we
then its up to openvpn to fork itself .
: )
i 'm adding it
if you want a steep learning curve , then try alpine linux : )
i see . i have several initrd images , one ending in .new which i assume is the one being
please watch your language .
yes , somewhere ( not in the db or theme branch ) those menu items are being defined , i
what kind of issues ?
?
what is the harm in having a defer close ?
maybe some settings in bios ... regarding security or antivirus ...
yeah , so have you added forcepae ?
maybe , what 's up ?
that drive is quite old.. nothing about lubuntu will be able to prevent it from opening . but , if
sure.. using a live iso will bypass your installed os and `` configuration '' ..
you 're just quackers
sounds like a release eol , what is your ?
how much of the content is code and how much cms ?
excellent ; congratulations
this will show you what partitions you have .
cool
: )
you need a release series for rtm
just drop him a memo ^^
i have the desktop one , but i 'm doing a little bit more in setup that just installing u-desktop
also you can install inxi and then run : inxi -a
i would assume not since the command works on it 's own
i did correctly actually , just did n't cross my mind at the moment
interesting . the local host now resolves using nslookup , but still unknown host when i try to ping it
how did your summer of code project go ?
but wrt to installation , errors only come from there . if snappy install gave fine grained errors for everything
sure you have nvidia-prime installed ?
i heve solved editing the nautilus shortcut and add on exec parameter = nautlinus smb : //homepc/documets
do you think i could losing perfomandce or something with this instalation ?
it 's already installed
there you go , pkill -9 apt , then apt update.. works like a charm
vivid is n't out yet , join # ubuntu+1
eg : item.name
no scotch for you . you get miller lite
the only way currently to see all package names in a given silo is clicking its details page , so
the whole world does business plans with office suites , the paloalto whatever you mentioned is utter crap imho .
thx
the drop back to the grub prompt is before the kernel , so the kernel update maybe more the cause
yes its ubuntu 15 but libreoffice 1:4.4.2
ppa 's are not supported here but when you use them they list what is there . you will probably
so if you agree that staging can be incremental ( part after part ) then i 'm in agreement and
oh , it 's maybe a pam issue or something
14.04 does n't use systemd .
i appreciate the feedback - please feel free to bring up anything else that looks inane : )
the point of server is to have less overhead so you can run it with less resource footprint and fewer
15.10 is development version so there might be problems with it , though i 'm using it on 2 machines
please wati
it might just about do ps1
yes
yeah , did n't sleep well last night either .
pastebin the output of the following commands ... . `` dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia '' ... . ``
in debian i use /etc/default/keyboard with ' xkboptions= '' caps : swapescape '' ' to swap it in both xorg
lol
sudo apt-add-repository ppa : relan/exfat
and make check test_case=create ?
but as usual must be supported by the operator too
and what version of ubuntu are you installing ?
okay i will try it
looks good
outside the chroot , please do `` pastebinit < ( mount ) '' so we can check that
i like that style of harley
depends on the use case .
you can not install what ?
the juju-gui bits are the same code ( roughly ) via a different jenkins
try the boot options first : nomodeset or no_acpi or forcepae to test if you can bypass your black screen
backdoor access ?
i 'd be curious if turning off qt 's input event resampling has any impact on that graph
ubuntu 15.04
though to be fair , you should n't have to care i suppose at first
info is the highest log level no ?
what version of ubuntu
ta
the memory consumption is pretty huge , 5.7gb after a reboot
however if i use aptitude , i can force these other packages which are also silently skipped to update .
the kernels have it built in
i loved bill murray in that movie ...
whatever it was , it corrected itself now
in reference to what ?
that should work , let me create a 14.04 real quick
if one fails due to another one not being present the ppa will retry it an hour or two later
christownsend : jibel : sil2100 : approving silo 9
ssh lenovo @ localhost
so i should only set ignore twins for this build , right ?
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2
what version are you attempting to install ?
seems to work right , 1 when on page and 0 otherwise
after you eat , please also take a look at the one with paul , so we agree on a
re list > ack , i 'll fix
hmmmmm
ehhh ... that will make it difficult
i could certainly look at it again
i 'm sorry , i did n't know someone threw it already
you could provide it from people.c.c as an interim solution
ok
glad you like it ! it 's only going to get better !
i can give it a look tomorrow if you want
elopio , please paste the bug url here
yup , i hear all your music discussions on -uk as well ; ) lol
occassionally migrations are added and then backed out
right , but i 've not yet seen a vanilla windows os system that suffers if it is kept with
sure : - )
nop i ve recently moved to dev channel and an on update 249
no , you can give fullpaths on linux . so it doesnt matter where the rar is
on it
is that an auto hide feature ? i just want it when it 's maximized
always issues with broadcom : p you can install lubuntu as an alternative desktop with `` sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop^
any errors on 'sudo mount -a ' ?
your fix is on qastaging now , btw . please check that it does what it says and does n't
no i want my system to be run non virtualized , i do not want any virtualization .
btw , would be great to have it available via a button in bileto , i needed it already a
ugh . that looks like an amazing mess .
openssh 's sshd
debian is *upstream*
how did you turn it on ?
for sure
but if an update got recent intel wifi driver , could also mes sup things perhaps
what happened to your friend 009 ?
why would it be different from any other linux distro ?
no
ok , you can hit a rebuild now
i used both ghhofstetter and grady hofstetter , both dont work
i had it ( since it was reported sooo long ago ) , but i ca n't find it -_-
ok , now give us the .dsc .debian.tar and .orig.tar
i did n't say it ca n't be done , but i just do n't see the appeal .
sure thing
moonstone
arch-linux
please consider updating gtk-doc and gobject-introspection as early as possible
ok , on it in a minute : )
i really wish that there was a good answer to it
so , when i say `` reacting '' , i 'm referring to how web admins are detecting tor traffic
i 'm in a meeting with jibel , in half an hour he should be free to discuss that
hmm okay fair , would it be a bad idea to add it manually ?
but for suspend issues see if the modules get loaded after resume
using gparted , right ?
i am having a look at the 5.5 multimedia thing so do n't have the silo installed
yes , it 's a bit early
yours obviously
sure
i tried using an nfs share first , but did n't find a way to authenticate sans kerberos.. so cifs
you should have a nvidia-xconfig file
this is a worker for machine agent for when we convert a normal server to a state server
if it 's just about a shellscript you might as well just do `` sh /media/foo/bar ''
what is ?
is it ubuntu on the mac , or os x you 're backing up ?
yes
that is weird . `` sudo service lightdm stop '' then `` pastebinit < ( ps -efly ) ''
ah damn , but the ubuntulistview etc right ?
sorry i 'm not helping you on this topic .
your list is outdated and needs to be updated first with the update command
how 's frameworks doing ?
: -p
sounds like fun , bit far from here
not hard to work around ( for now )
when we have to explain every single bit it all gets jumbled and lost .
your error is described in the first message
in theory - if the black screen was caused by the gpu issue - the screen should remain active during
grub-install ?
they are just different / legacy / new options
i did n't miss it - just ignored it : )
try `` sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sdg1 /mnt ''
that 's o.k . i was n't expecting you to be .
how about changing the window manager
i wait a minute , screeen switch off by it self , and music still playing
a bootload ? you eman grub stuff ? o :
ok - got it
architecture i386 is added already as otherwise it would not show you that it tires to install those i386 packages
of course we need new tests
that command mounts the important kernel file-systems into the target
okay great
generally support questions are better directed to the forums or ask ubuntu .
i 'm done editing
hold on , tj- has pointed out that you can disable os-prober another way
ppa builders are a shared resource , so the longer your build takes , the longer it takes to get
if you can , make sure you set the prefix for self-compiled libs to `` /usr/local '' . the package
indeed not , itunes 10 is programmed specifically only to help apple get paid
for starters the home dir itself , furthermore depends on the folder . you 'd want ~/.ssh to keep 700
right , and we ca n't do that for the archive
done .
so i proposed that the adapter code goes into a layer called openstack which places them in lib/openstack/adapters.py
and then chown www-data -r /var/www/html or ?
this is on a liveusb
wait you are talking about suspending the executable , not the system wakelock
i know , it has for a long time too , it 's frankly amazing that you guys still get
may be you must use apt-get -f install and autoremove
it begins to shutdown - > dark purplish splash screen with 14.04 - > shows the dots - > then
if it was a common issue , you 'd see people in here all time
then type sudo update-grub , see if it picks up windows this time
in `` xmodmap ''
paste an example ...
just now , i upgraded my system to 15.10 , in the last step , `` cleaning '' , it
otoh its understandable : nobody knows if berlin will even have an airport finished in only 10 more years ,
nothing , you 've unloaded them modules and moved them so they ca n't be loaded
it 's sorted by request number so if you 're looking for a silo number it 's easier to search
ok , what 's the problem
you listen to doom metal at any time ?
yeah , that 's what i did in the old-skool sbuild fork , since i did n't care about supporting
pull again
yeah i already brew installed charm-tools
'ning
you played the brat first : ) welcome to a retort .
what are the alternatives ?
so if you want me to do that , i can
i wouldnt expect it to work `` out of the box ''
yes , spur
but your mount says that sdb1 is mounted in /home
which ubuntu release is it , 15.10 ?
as long as it is somehow possible to get 3 stars , nothing is too hard
the software centre ...
yes , in firefox it works fine .
not that something else broke in odd ways and slipped through the ap/qmltest somehow
i have both os installed , but always use 14.04 , nothing all that different
when it goes missing , it does n't come back in any app until reboot
are you running that test individually ? if so , a print ( 'hello ! ' ) should write hello
how does one remove a component from the community store ?
what repo does the missing package come fro m ?
okay . the tests in my thumbnailer branch no longer crash with the silo applied .
and who should i approach for that ?
sorry ...
of course i have no idea because this test is sitting on a giant stack of layered testing framework
if you think it 's a bug , then please file it
yes , phone
i doubt they wo n't accept our contribution . since i signed in , they send me constant emails ,
about the libreoffice icons ...
ok
connection between card and speaker digital ?
this is not landing in trunk
i have my scale set to 3 : d
do you get a notification about removable device ? there should be a thing in your system tray
it is , on win32 ; )
because they 're in sync only because disruptive changes have n't landed yet
this is the issue , black screen after resume from suspend
nah it will switch to tty7
alright man
i 'm not surprised by it not traveling through the time to yesterday : )
i 'm pretty sure that 's just a hold-over from an earlier version of juju that ran more than one
yeah , 3.0 ( native )
lool
i broke the label in windows and now it thinks my c drive is an f drive
this is for pia . if you 're having issues , they 're the ones to talk to .
do you have more log ? ...
actually , we built more silos which resulted in more rails and more trains driving those.. !
i 'm going to land it , and update / file a bug for checking on the flavor support .
done
yeah , great
which netsat command are you using to see what 's sniffing your connection ?
that 's what you get !
sure . *thats* what i would expect , if , as i suggested , i have a broken config in
as opposed to ?
`` if line.startswith ( '=== ' ) or not line.strip ( ) : '' should do it ? ( or
i 'm not positive , but i would *think* so
agreed
have you had anything to do with the juju user support , by any chance ?
synaptic package manager > > > status > > > all > > > installed > > > bottom of
it is a micro sd card into a usb stick converter
! # $ % ^ is 99.93 % lame
but ubuntu provides only 2.0
i was just trying to get it all functional : )
stop that
yeah , quite possibly
do you have any other sources file maybe in /etc/sources.list.d/ ?
but as for what to review , i 'd say just that my code is n't crazy and that it
that 's actually a valid question
i 've been verifying it for more than one hour now , so nope
how do i find out ?
yes , but it 's a bit of a manual process
ok ...
sudo pvscan -- cache ?
yeah i increased the granularity of the status reporting ( now reporting per-arch statuses ) and the bot went crazy
can read that up in the cmake files i guess
well now at work we use centos and redhat instead of ubuntu , so if we were to manage it
i would think that unity holds it the whole time though , so g-s ca n't get involved
like you would on your installed system .
try screen -r alone without anything
yeah , unless you choose enable networking too , but that can hang sometimes
make sure you do n't leave ssh open
ok , so when a vulnerability is found apache , apache releases a new version of its product ?
ahh , so this acc autopkg test comes from debian
the log data from /var/log/juju/unit-keystone-1.log would also be useful
then please tell me where to ask ?
you can delete the windows partitions , and make them a separate /home partition , and a swap , and
ok give it a whirl
and nexus 7 is the device
oh hmm sorry i thought that it depends on autopilot-touch , but apparently not .
having issue with keybord
and the maas test server needs extending to support all this
is there any package for doing this ? ?
ok , great it 's empty
yes there is no driver in 14.04 or 14.10 for a 750 ti yet
oh i know . i 've had this conversation
it should be there , under the advanced sub-menu .
can you look whether the w system has the right link
well , cron logs every command to /var/log/syslog with a timestamp already .
or just because my commits are in there ?
read the docs and readme from that image .
it shows the device id under cat /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
windows telling you that means it ca n't read the card and thinks it is unformatted . do you have
well what does lightdm need ? the umm
speaking of which , do you need one of the old bt keyboards ?
! ubuntu-gnome , ! kubuntu , ! xubuntu and ! lubuntu are simply flavors of ubuntu that come with gnome
phone . be right back .
does it do that , display the real name instead of user name ?
you talk too much : - )
nee man , surely we have to talk about these things
i 'm afraid i have no idea
you flatter me
.cpanm , .pip , .r , r-dev , .rnd , .root_hist , .rootrc , .rpmdb , npwebpg-v0.6.1-linux_x86-gcc3.so , npwebpg-v0.6.1-linux_x86-gcc3.so.1 ,
so , that specific case is meant to be covered by some automated testing we 're going to be doing
its a pentium with intel hd graphics
i too am getting an occasional failure perhaps on test_edit_topic
there is only zuul .
right , okay . what is the output of 'xrandr ' ?
i 'm better than last week : ) - no blockers
not reinstall , you said you had ssh access ... so restart the x session from there then try again
otherwise { mysql } .available is always set
lsb_release -a
interesting
i wont accept that i was wrong , because the asnwer i gave would do exactly what i said it
ok , maybe remove with dpkg then
hm ... that does n't give me anything
thx
i would n't consider my inotify argument a blocker upstream at all , they seem pretty keen on positions like
well , dont you know what setup is installed ?
i got this when i have a a memory or a eds plugin installed but built with a different qt
oops mo
^
and that did produce a good tarball ?
have not got the pc with me , partions are sda2=efi sda3=winrecovery sda4=win8 sda5=boot sda6=ubuntuseverluks sda7=ubuntu14.04gui
a ) juju deploy returned a timeout , we retried it , it then said the service already exists
root will always have permission to do anything .
i 've found that using touch in /mnt and mounting a filesystem to the file you touched has been pretty
really and you just went ahead and installed other stuff anyway ?
hmm . running dconf-editor as root , removed the line . do n't see a way to save it .
if you use nat the virtual system will live on its own little network . if you use bridged ,
that is the exact message that appears on the screen ?
did . clicked on report . nothing happened .
^
no , not anymore ... : p
can you ping 10.14.100.1 ?
then try 14.04 if you have same issue there
what i was expecting was that i could set a state during -relation-departed and then follow-up on it in -relation-broken
no error but not listed in lsmod . since this is a new install , i do n't mind reinstalling
tested the silo . imo good . as soon as the last qtubuntu branch is approved i 'll submit to
or `` dig archive.ubuntu.com '' if you have that
let me propose an mp and see if i can write a small test
login screen
well , first up the simple stuff , make sure that kdepasswd is indeed installed .
heh : ) probably i will hate myself for not taking the easy option
nah , really ? please tell me you 're kidding , right ?
i 'm surprised it 's not working now even though you moved the xorg.conf file out of the way and
did you type install -f ?
you tell me why you have a .deb manually downloaded : ) i ca n't read your mind sadly
i applied for ubuntu membership board
your going to hate it ... : d
i meant that the bios/drive can read/boot optical discs still
that 's the third point : ) yeah - that was a backwards incompatible api change , but iirc frankban
i own a tp-link tl-ps310u

you used that before , after all

do you have a kind of bug page of this problem ?

pen & paper is actually not even a bad idea
me neither . and that might have something to do with not talking to canonical people very often . ;
yeah , i 've not used the v4 bundle format as much as i should
nope .
you ca n't have an efi system partition on top of mdraid anyway , as again it 's something that

that means the x server crashes , strange that it doesnt happen with the guest account
i 'm a noob . no idea .
/bin/sh is dash
strange , the logs are n't loading for me
but unless you use them they sit there doing nothing , so you can use the very things you want
we dropped the ubuntu patches there
there were systemd packages for 14.10 iirc , but i would not think of using that everyday stable wise
wait , have you tried using a different shell ? sh , zsh , ksh or something first ?
to verify the fix in [ 1 ] after editing the gprs file a reboot will do as well ?

i did , this is a new one i just made
you need the snmp daemon if you 're running a service that uses snmp to communicate with the server .

so this is n't a normall ubuntu install ? it is a live usb or persistant usb ?
how can i change the picture for splash ?
yep ... but now package does n't have etc/xdg/kdeglobals at all..
ahh ... of course . so we had a release to the archive what was not merged to the trunk
no my home is not on a separate partition , only /boot is in its separate ext2 partition
if yes , do you think you could upload it ? i have a bit of a bad connection here
if i can upgrade from 1.22 that will suffice for testing
please have a look for suspicious content inside the xorg server log .

maybe it is my local snappy that is out of date ...

i 'll play it safe 3.16 for now
that makes asking here not valid .
so i simply type in terminal ?
already chowned -r 1000 :
great , another thing , in case you did n't notice we have integration tests executions with each pr at
so we 'd need ci to run for both wily and vivid+o on their trunks
if you 'd like to test but have nothing to do , there 's a fair amount of sru 's
when did you try that ? those issues are resolved since friday
hopefully it is still installing the upgrades
read that bug report
right havent thought of that
no . just the first one named 'login ' needs your user pass
llucas__a prime example would be that features video for antergos
yes , because if i recall correctly this video card has the non intel gpu videocore
does it have an hdmi in ? or some video in ?

no idea , maybe ask in # # linux
you can look and try out unity 8 using one of the alpha builds somewhere on the ubuntu website..
want dualboot or single ubuntu ?
yes
depends what you mean by `` such stuff ''
np - i 'll have another look at it when i get back

older kernels like 3.13 buildt well
im pretty busy today on stuff , but ping me sometime this next week and we can figure out how
would apt-get remove < nameofthing > work ?
so it could still be logged .
right , so its probably fine as is , and can ignore all the list-missing output
then why did you install server , when you wanted a desktop os ?
you `` have '' it ? where 's the full key ?
would you rather remain vulnerable to a bunch of bugs ?

try installing the deps manually , then smplayer afterwards
quite reproducible
it 's something regarding the request

follow the prompts , eventually you will have the option of mounting your existing system and getting a shell in
we gernally have either that or bots - if the project has a good test suite we can make it
sorry about the timing . i 'll have look when i 'm back
package qt5-base does not exist in vivid
ok , try the dist-upgrade command
worth of reporting a bug , it is most probably linux bug in supporting hardware or something . what is
boiko : since this fix is important for ota-4 , maybe qa can help out with testing the fix ?
you could . that would be persistent , but you could also pass -i to ssh i believe .

ok , so let 's just restart in run.sh

alright . i 'm a bit confused by that though . this is a canonical project , for ubuntu personal
estimating the same release timeperiod ...
i only ran a .run file
i could do that , but that would just hide the bug and honestly it seems like it should be

it is already installed like i told you it generated the last xorg.conf on its own
if you use the support link at the bottom of the login page , u1 support can probably sort it
yes it does

dandrader can review i 'd say , i do n't think there 's a plan for a hotfix already ,
yeah i would advise 14.04 server for long time support
is it part of the clock ?
we could easily package the old version as gedit3.10 and have both in the archive
i would be happy to create a guide , but i never got it to work ( mostly because of
me neither , bfiller asked me to help with the landing , but it is my first click package landing

grafix card chipset and ubuntu version please ?
i 'm planning to be in touch with that guy using xubuntu on his classes on the local uni where
what i *want* is `` get me this subnet - adding it if it does n't exist ''
well , after restart my browser cant open any page at all anymore
i 've got an install cd
oh lol : p
can it be that in the meantime i had shut down my system ?
in this case upstart is being used to launch the app
same error after doing that .
? hummm , i 'd think fbset would work correctly with nouveau ...
yeah i can do it , no worries
got a url ?
often it creates new machines , often it causes the state server to chat to the provider about the plausibility
if that is possible then it might be just a respin
dpme
apt-cache policy < package >
the whole image will come from the store in the future
the first answer on that link has 353 upvotes . consensus is pretty much there . and no need for
sorry i 'm really new to this , i was trying to have my upstart script wait until a log
no , not actively/willingly
what are you typing from now ?
ok , so let 's see what jenkins says : )
i can notice a little jumping though that was n't there before
that is completely irrelevant for ubuntu gnome , and for ubuntu that is what is being logged/indexed locally that information
/me leaves
it is . along with moving data from one disk to another live .
the `` better '' channel , again , would be # # security
lockout ?
does midonetcontext get used elsewhere ? otherwise lets avoid a ch-sync task and just drop it into the contexts for
what 're you doing up ? ! ?
no , can you tell me chipset at top ill look it up for you
yeah , i know , i 've tried it though
properly land ?
not much difference
iow , boot into ubuntu , plug the usb stick , chroot in it , install the pkg , etc
the laptop stopped responding
ignore me ... i 'm still not awake
merge request on lp : tarmac
yeah , i have a couple of identical systems and the one i ran insserv on is now having booting/shutdown
perhaps running a development vm would be most convenient among those ; just install ubuntu 15.04 in virtualbox and do
that 's relying on the same undefined behaviour
the share is on linux
i could have them fairly easily
is a fool with it.. that 's awesome
is it really ? ; - ) i just do think that wasting a full pair of server for the
did you look at the improved filtering options yet ?
the line below swap right
nothing is making any sound lol youtube , vlc , system sounds ... nothing .
then try again that settings
i would definitely try the windows shutdown before continuing .
yes , and in fact i needed to ask you about that , what does sponsorship of flisol give us
get to recovery mode so i can reset the password on an old box : s
sure
sounds like the mini cd a netload .
well it 's not in the pastebin you posted
fair on requiring packages , forgot that detail
no matter , the bot should be informed of that and link to it
i was sincere..
and that worker would be dialing in from machine 0
using the package-manager , if you 're talking about the archive version
that 's not necessary
the version of lptools is `` 0.0.1~bzr34-1 ''
that is not true
install each of the depdencies manually - until you hit the core package causing the error
demo was the name of the charm i wrote to test it , so in your case it would be
the onelink pro one yeah
ok , i figured ( and that 's what i tried ) ; i 'd like to know if the
but show desktop is not the exact function i would like , as when i click any application from taskbar
vesa and fbdev
a windows driver .inf file tells windows how to install and configure drivers , all driver packages have one
i do n't see it . but the issue has fixed itself for now and that 'll do for the
by the way , the url you gave me earlier worked
yeah , makes it more clear .
14.10 is still the default but it is being fixed as we speak
your system was an upgrade ? from wich to wich ?
we need new seeds updated and uploaded
no
oh right your next run . i also started my next run already , the previous one on mako (
that makes sense
it is good because we can autocomplete and select tests specifically or with a filter
download winscp or bitvise ... you 'll like it
please pastebin the output of `` nm-tool '' .
have you tried the options to connect to the `` console '' ?
/var/crash
in a bit - i 'm being pinged by 15 people right now
you should only be putting something in *.install if the upstream build system installs it
from the design
feedback on the shaddow on the gwenview screenshot
mirv/robru
i am just a minion .
bah , i can get that stuff anywhere : )
whatever the screen res of those screenshots is : )
so in the browser urlbar , holding ctrl or alt gives you that same capslock ability as shift ?
testing unity8/mir on xenial right now : p

learn it , srsly
probably want /dev/urandom
heya .
there was a hilarious part that used to say `` ci airline will be ready ~july 2014 '' so that
would be cool to have that work and utilize one of btrfs 's strongpoints : )
ahhh , well that tells us something does n't it ? some unit ( service ) that is started by
mysql -u root -p
autosync is off .
can you pastebin your code where you listen for onexportrequested ?
mp3
10.04 is no longer supported . 12.04 is lts and still supported . 14.04 came out in 14.04 ( april
ubiquity-kde.png
so no more details on tasks vs metas ?
no , the imports are right
fiel a bug against 15.10 or try lts
ok
is this about that pop-that-wrap game bug ?
you can put them into a pastebin and then show the urls here . be sure to have the logs
which one ? blank areas ?
yay ! link ?
better install `` linux-generic '' too , to get the headers installed automatically
it 's likely because i had to reinstall because first time through i had enabled fde by accident and forgot
if all else fails , sudo pm-suspend , should put your laptop to sleep
show me an `` lspci ''
or you could upgrade to 15.10 to see if upgrading fix the problem , but in 15.10 you can not
i would n't go that far : p
your driver seems installed correctly , can you tell us whats going slow on your systeme xactly ?
to multiboot you have to chainload one os from the other .
my ? i report bugs on `` our '' software . not on `` my '' software . so i
let 's join # kubuntu-offtopic .
did you make out like a pro ? : p
it 's not entirely feature complete when it comes to touch interaction yet
how do i install that ?
sure , lem me know if you still have issues .
looking
security
yes no it 's clear . i was just trying to remember what i knew about those two and what
which release are you on ?
file extension for that ?
let me ask the question differently ...
i was here earlier today ... not in the past 2 weeks ... got this puppy on saturday
can you not just take like the time ( ) and compare ?
could be hardware . could be your network
do we know folks in debian who can help getting the patch in ?
that is highly likely . the 2 gpu 's went first , then the power supply , about a month
something like that iirc , yes
yup , planning to test it tomorrow
lp : mir , lp : mir/ubuntu ?
another being gnome-shell
but if it is a problem , it does n't have to be all or nothing . it might mean
either outside creation or when all that stuff is done relative to the boot sequence
ok , on it
given that you ca n't actually do that till you 're in a build and it 's repeated there
okay , definitely not what i want
you can put that in the oem snap in the config section as well
where are the contents of the current hook that is copying the coverage.xml file ?
so that url looks fine to me , what are you changing to make it work ?
i also recommend a book on os 's if the terms are confusing to you . silbershatz and tannenbaum are
and `dasd_mod.ko` ended up in both dasd-modules and the extra variant , that 's a conflict .
i do n't remember marking bugs as bitesize to point you to it , but that 's something we should
i 'll blog about how to build those
cheers
nb : using charmbox to review
thats why i asked you those questions .
but that 's not via url dispatcher , it 's just done via ual directly
which virt tech and what network setup ? bridging , host only or nat , etc ?
as described before , 15.10 . and lxde
any idea what sort of storage system they use ?
no
maybe check additional drivers section for other driver ?
all i follow : 1. dh_make 2. debian/rule clean 3. debian/rules build 4. debian/rules binary
ahh
+1
yes .
change mirrors
ati card , by chance ?
yeah , it 's from there that i 've run `` sudo service sddm restart '' , and just in
i placed a file called .seen-getting-started-guide in the home directory . i did n't think it made sense to put
english
so it crashes when it calls the get ( ) ?
let 's make things easier . `` udisksctl unmount -- block-device /dev/sda2 '' ... that should remove that user mount
i 've archived the new card about the services and added a comment with the check to the existing one
ughh guess it 's time to dust off my copy of parted magic
# ubuntu-offtopic is a party ; )
it is not really harmful , you can just ignore them
done ... but i 'd like to test it ... just to be sure
on the maas side or on the node side ?
the last game i played was populus 2
well ... have no other choice now ... i opened it a couple of times to find the uart ,
yes it does
right , we should work closely with them though , i do n't like the idea of throwing this stuff
its generated in the router and i have the router as an dns server
i have a large textarea . the last added text should be visible even when the osk hides bottom part
debootstrap
can i reboot now ?
we just assumed
edit the kernel configuration file or use `` make menuconfig ''
use a clean install on the same disk
i will do
if its video card why would it work on the standard ubuntu player and vlc and not mplayer ?
rebooting router , i 'll reconnect in 2 mins
its a bit fishy ha !
basically , attempt to promote source package , check if there are more or fewer uninstallable packages in testing as
one is to try to save your install , and this is by far the hardest option .
after a reboot , the two cpus always work flawlessly and show up and are usable so it 's weird
i 'm staying with lts for this cycle
going to 12.10 ? end of life .
see the second one : )
if you 're interested and able , there is a way to achieve this by terminal .
ok
will take some minutes to reboot , back soon
what sorts of blues do you prefer
slight typo in it , oops , the ending should be ... { , .d/* }
those are just two commands , no need for scripts/functions yet - just open a console - put the first
that 's definitely bad
i thought it was not needed anymore . nytimes should try it then .
i 'm desperate to not join more mailing lists ; )
ah , live it from a live usb
we should make a bug for that private session idea
yeah , so the fix is good , but we ca n't land it - but infinity already has it
well , rtm died and now everybody who would have wanted an rtm silo now wants an ubuntu silo .
you 're using the wrong user name
to be fair , nothing breaks until a snap is uploaded
given that it looks like a mistake to me , i was hoping to let somebody know
*click*
are you kidding me ?
yeah you 're right
have you used busybox ?
get ubuntu 15.04 ... it 's better .
yup , just now was able to reply .
yeah , i am just wondering if this happens to other people as well
but you want qml though , right ?
sure i will try to help , i had quite nice holidays slept a lot : -p
i see merge conflicts ?
heh , so i do n't mind this azure device as it will go away as soon as we solve
ah ... says published , so snappy search should say snap1.1
i 'm not , i 'm mounting the nfs export on a second machine
awesome
i ca n't find a brightness plugin as an option
yeah , same here . and i did n't bring my dslr , did n't expect that it would come
yes , and it indicates that `` systemd-cryptsetup-generator '' should be run to translate /etc/crypttab ... i bet that is
that is hard , language stuff like that is pretty new
i never have ; run means the host and chroot env services get mixed up
what 's the exact name for it ?
in an unconfined scenario , i also agree that the cache should be shared across apps .
once that lands i 'll update dependencies.tsv and propose the juju-core pr
oh hah the page must not have refreshed for me
i found a behaviour i dont know if its a bug , a packaging error or a feature , lol
i have /usr/share/icons/adwaita/cursor.theme
no worries
which packages did you install from that ppa ?
i 'll take some logs and file a bug this evening when at home
why resign ?
native ipv6 sounds nice . *sniff* enjoy the turtle !
it looks like i have nvidia-prime seems installed
did you have error after installing from terminal ?
you can either modify the log structure to make it possible to avoid that ( but not introduce a lumberjack
so i guess it remained in tablet mode ?
you can see now why i have to visit sf over fl
: ) i understand now
use unetbootin and make one for the desktop version
afaik it was built for , and only tested with , logitech cameras
did you update the link to the new click file in the document ?
we stopped using bzr a long time ago . our current repostories are on git.debian.org owned by the pkg-kde team
no problms do you know when the new features will be available
i am practically out of my league now since after reinstalling plex ahsnt made any changes , so let me
ack , ill work on getting a custom tar ready so we can test both together
hey
: ) look'n .
i have not been involved upstream , however judging from the traffic on the devel list and commits at the
explain how you need help to the channel
look at both what is configured and what is actually happening
yes , please delete them
i 'm trying to replicate error
pleast put the messages into a pastebin and show the url here . details matter a lot
i continue to investigate this ; the failed initctl is probably/hopefully just harmless noise
maybe as a option ? its a pretty cool feature
do n't use deb-testing repos on a prod box
paste the link here when you do
you been having funny conversations with yourself ?
will try again to confirm
what do i have to do ?
woow ! ! ! : )
inst there a gui tool or something idk how the icons look or where are they ?
so you have a desktop , you just dont have a monitor attached to it to use the monitor .
sorry , i mean corrupt cloned .
yea i 've usually modprobed manually
i wiped all the original partitions completely , guess i just have to live with the boot problem ... i
if nobody complains , we wo n't spend time to fix it .
yeah and afaik lsc is on its way out
any opinion if that good enough , or do you think a gsettings approach would be better ?
what teward says . the 1.9 to 1.10 bump is actually a no change branch aiui , much like moving
how can i know which driver corresponds to which/my card ?
can you by any chance give me a had with something
in theory launching `upstart -- user` from vt/ssh should do the right thing , in practice it tries & fails
and then we can use gmock inside this implementation
will do this evening
i can ask msm for one , who 's coordinating booth supplies with her ?
yeah , i need one of those too : )
try this
yes , it should fix the repos and set them to the right state
and i ca n't run pkg-config , cos of cmake
but no dns
yes again
but that is n't an option for spotify due to the way libspotify works
you could replace the file with another icon as it is just a picture but be careful editing system files
that is , what xupnpd made , a simple m3u
qemu
there are a couple arch : all only packages , so take them too .
european business hours ...
try a purge reinstall
fedora do n't link with -- as-needed
yeah , that 's what penny for nasa is all about : we should n't be spending whole dollars on
so is that bad ?
maybe you overlooked something in config ?
yeah so you still do n't have tj- 's recommended line on your bootup parameters
but pitti said itworked for him on xenial
it was a shame for me , specially that the target pc was for my company . if i become
ugh
+1
ok , i can do that
there is no grub menu . it immediately drops into shell mode .
o hey man
tonyyarusso banned me
i 'm sure you can figure out where to search even when it 's speaking to you in german
i created a vm with /home , /home/martin , and /srv on separate partitions , just like on the laptop
aha thx
good thought . : d
im suggesting recording it locally gets the *best* audio quality.. and it does . better than over the network
it does not have any theme
ok there 's actually multiple ways to confirm whether the install of 7 is legacy or efi , you could
does it work for you ?
but it should n't throw up a bazillion errors and not boot - like windows would if you tried something
did you check the germinate outputs ?
it is n't directly seeded , is it ?
the serial number is leaked by adb , as well . i ca n't actually _think_ of a non-dumb attack
k
\o/
i 've changed the spreadhseet to target vivid
windows 7
lol ... my dumb mistake , but that 's what i thought you said to do ... hot-pluggable , etc
this is a family friendly channel = zero profanity
and how long is it going to take you to learn and become proficient in go ?
in go i jst started writing them and all was fine , the world was happy ; in python there
and ?
well , i do n't have high hopes . i do n't need a sim toolkit app . : )
in other words you should use the windows drivers
mcphail : i 'll do that . just going to localize it .
any idea what i can do about it ? : )
i 'd create the trunk and next branches for all of them now under openstack-charmers
the same applies to networks and spaces ( i 'm now adding )
oh yeah , it was windows 95 . they had a reset button in front of the computer which rebooted
apt-fet autoremove will remove old kernels automatically
but cherylj was able to repro it
yes
still no idea why my checked branches have issues with tags , but running the command remotely works
hello
make it easier to grep/identify your urls
on it just now , but we seem to have a problem
i 'm tall but even i ca n't reach that far
which only the client/server platforms would know how to read
usc does clone mode right now
heh , this at least needs to be accompanied by proper documentation ; - )
the problem was that after a fresh install-upgrade of 14.04 to 14.10 and setting the static ip via /etc/network/interfaces ,
open your ubuntu software center and search for record desktop . those are your choices .
that 's what we 've been doing
do you know where the `` 229396 '' version number comes from and how it changes over time ?
darker color , fixed
i strongly oppose online searches as this basically turns cnf into a different product/service ( which is not bad ,
nope
nvidia , graphics-drivers ppa , default in repo
lol
you must have an older kubuntu then . they went away from ffmpeg to avconv for a short time ,
where is that ?
is there another way to check cpu usage that does n't skew the results so heavily , then ?
no , at the moment they are useless
yes
yeah , the person does n't seem to have the full set of logs
nice one
btw thats for dolphin-plugins
i also tried to enable password auth globally which didnt seem to affect the daemon
ah
who knows , at the moment it 's an idea , a useful one imo and i 'm happy to
i do n't typically run all the tests , just the ones around what i 'm working on
or the simples is to just add the objectname for the thumb ?
well , i keep it broken for now to get again the right logs ^ ( probably monday for logout/login
i guess it could ...
so you 're logged into the ubuntu box as `` developer '' ?
just fading
i 'd want some *other* gnu/linux os - but just not one with unity
yeah something like this : )
enjoy ! better to eat light , keep some space for the cheese tonight
what are your current specs ? that is almost impossible with modern specs
looking
true , again sorry for that
i mean , if you are dealing with some enormous # of entries ( millions of names ) , then
and with 'tee ' you can use its 'tee -a ... ' option to *append* the output to an existing

erm , you know debian is frozen right ?
ty ! wo n't work well on n4 , sadly , but ota7 will bring a fix .
i am good and u ?
but the app store is the only real way to install apps on an ubuntu phone , how did you
hold on
its actually motorola moto g
so to be sure , you 're ssh'ing as username @ host when you try after the pi boots up
cmp-test needing a commit message
do you mind if i make the project look like other plugins ?
anyway , we 'll do whatever you tell us to do , you 're the packaging master after all ,
of course
did you hear something on the ops yet ?
we ca n't know much now cause you used boot-repair , if i had to guess i would say windows
i am not able to copy back things from device to the desktop over bluetooth .
i have same usb bootable

any idea why the queuebot didnt pick up my watch-only rebuild of silo 19 ?
do you have the chance to get some more reliable wifi hardware ?
basicly

i have active login , if you mean staying logged in across sessions . but this is only in the

how old is your target audience ?
yes
were you talking to me ?
can you point me at some code in particular ?
you see there 's no excuse for `` too young '' , we do n't do that
no of course , i was just looking for the right steps to migrate . so it would be somethin
that would probably simplify it a bit
if you are not around , i 'll just get to you later on
i switched ports mouse moves still wont click

yep .
right , how
i 'm aiming to set up enviroments with each scenario and then test various changes , starting with swapping user
it could be the usb iso image is n't bootable ... i had that problem with startup disk and unetbootin
sure ... but running devel-proposed is a bit risky ... have you ever re-flashed it since then ?
yes that is the official master for xenial
ok , see where /dev/sr0 is mounted
was it hanging , basically doing nothing ?
on it : )
yes , right after subnets ( ) should be a good place for it - do n't you think ?
what does omfg means ?
also v1 api is run on only 2 servers compared to the 14 servers for v2 api . i really
no
alright , whatever is happening in the other terminal is holding this up ... go back to it and try
anything waiting to be merged in ubuntu-snappy or can we just release current trunk ?
i 'll mark it ready for qa
again : never done that but ... looks like the -- post-date=string or -- post-file=file options are what you 're
if you are not intentionally making use of ipv6 , `` sudo ip -6 route del default '' should clear
i assume you saw my last 'usability ' bug
have you tried the dependencies i told to install ?
what does it mean
`` fd = new_fd '' : i 'd seriously recommend using gz_fd and tar_fd to avoid confusion
did you run sudo apt-get update before it ?
still nothin ? syslog empty ?
7 is much better , and 10 is better still .
i 've qtbase5-dev installed on my xenial lxc without problems , let me try dist-upgrading it though
i am just curious - articles are saying that with access to the grs one can install `` malware ''
ok understood .
shall you link the bug to the mr ?
you can use console mode , ctrl-alt-f6
at that point you should have a configure menu
they did n't have latency before
no idea , who wrote it ?
but you tested them all you said right
yes
could u chat through jabber ?
if you wish to be completely sure , you can export all of your machines via file - > export
no there are not in recycle bin
so edit /etc/hosts to add an ip and a domain - but bear in mind if you use a *real*
sounds good
perfect
should i open a launchpad bug ?
i would use btrfs due to snapshots and incremental send/recieve etc , but that is probably just me
i 'd recommend using ufw until you get familiar with the iptables ( or next , nftables ) rules
ok
i bet it does have a unity-api requirement
ahhh .
this would just be a `` is this possible , how would this look '' once that 's figured out
how so ?

would be nice to have that written down somewhere
i appreciate your eyes : )
and what are all the mir packages in ppa 26 then ?
it 's the package being built , the only version dpkg really knows has the symbol . so , for
awesome
libmirclient-dev [ amd64 arm64 armhf i386 ] ,
ok - boot into it again - then we can have a look in the logs to see if there
we still have many folks out on swap days
have you tried lately ?
might be in japan
javascript kills them , especially over time : -/
we can force a package installation , but but no telling what else we will break . still pondering what
i would suggest , first do the runconfig and the output pane
how can i give you and what are the files you want ? some of the original and extracted ,
the script tries to rename only the packages with changed symbols
not the mounted folder
seems wrong to me . what do you think ?
either from a terminal writting `` marble '' or using the icon on the main menu/education
so in that can , quilt push < the patch that has fuzz >
and you want not to boot into ubuntu , get one file and then boot into windows again ?
hahah
yes
ls -al /home/boo/.config/pulse//daemon.conf
we will package it on the gnome3 ppa
england
you have too many problems . single one out and focus on solving it !
the difference being what i already told you .
anyway we can make that ucs.curated.emptystate 1.0 ?
or use the web interface . or install 64bit ubuntu like the majority of people do in 2015 .
im not entirely sure ... ..my screen is all black with white letters and no mouse curser ... ..sorry i
i love a man that knows what he wants ; )
juju version ?
i will do . i 've filed those notes and will do some research to better understand how this all
now running publish again , let 's see..
ok posted at the url you sent
its disabled
one sec
no need for pastebin : an error occurred while loading the archive .
lol
i wat to test silo 34. but it is building against some libraries from proposed universe ( libphonenumber ) and
apt-get -- no-install-recommends install gnome-system-tools
better use sftp - ftps is just ftp over ssl : p
the packages will be saved in apt 's archive directory , so they do n't need downloading again
alt_f2 doesnt show anything
can you `` pastebinit < ( sudo blkid ) '' -- typo !
every ota release
okay , if you have enough free partition space for ubuntu , then just install it to that space
how do you add my name to ur msg ?
have you looked at the access/error logs in the admin panel , under administration > server ?
what tz are you in ?
sounds like it 's spinning , waiting from a response that never arrives
i 'll adda todo in the relevant structs
whoops , sorry ... it seems like he is gone
usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java
this is just to test if your disc is good
defaults here
ok . please let me know if we can help with anything of this , from the indicator side .
yes the source packages should still exist .
it was late and i was n't sure what the previous behaviour was .
if the answer was no , fat32 would be the suggestion .
my problem is alignment in a struct
i 'm presuming that the trunk python-django charm passes tests
aha , yes
your branch is expecting 5.0.0~git20150828.4bbab865
yes , not exactly what i 'd expected .
i was playing with it friday and made a unit which rebooted the system if lightdm managed to come up
basically , you can declare the same method multiple times , marking them with a different revision
you can also check which mode you 're booted in by typing ls -ld /sys/firmware/efi , if it does n't
i have n't merged it to trunk yet , just waiting for superfly to approve as well
eihter you give exact and real informations or you join the chatter channel for your chitchat .
`` pastebinit ~/.xauthority '' as well please
do `` ls -l '' do you see a file `` /init '' of around 7-8000 bytes listed
we can help you convert your content into docbook
ok. do you , by any another chance , know why the bookmarks i add in dolphin disappear when i
if payui is treated as an ordinary app , it means that it will appear in the ubuntuone account under
ctrl-backspace deletes the entire word in front of the cursor , ctrl-delete would delete the entire word in front of
although actually hmmm . it might be working , that error might be a red herring
it doesnt reach desktop
do n't get me started on acer !
ok i 'll see which of the two approches gives the better result
no that 's fine
that 's right.. moving forward
no 4g yet ?
i did just that : )
you can click icons in the background
done : d but of course my shipit is not loaded with much power : d
then i 'm probably wrong about google . is it okay to remove or comment out the canonical part ?
i 'm sure spatry made a vid on that
i created the .bashrc
it 'll probably help prevent the computer from using swap for a little longer , but the p3 is just
i have no idea what that url is
stop giving bad advise !
looks a lot like 15.04 to me : )
right , given that , i 'm considering leaving vivid 's status alone
no , i dont think that.. but , im saying , *i* would know , by just simply testing .
is the i915 driver right at the gpu hardware level ?
the weird libmarblewidget soversion detection in rules
arch++
it might also prevent you from adding displays ( i.e . an external monitor )
i tried root user , again i get permisison denied error
oh , wich ubuntu version are you , ?
thats all what i hope . ( i saw so many stange troubles ) . it 's one of the
why would i need an upgrade ?
so send it to your chinese friends
and fix the silo so that the package builds on every archs
are you able to reproduce the failure locally , on desktop or the phone ?
if it exists in both suites and one of you is removing it , you have a bug .
yeah , popey actually has a copy of that nsa program , on his server
you .. what ?
correct
i am unsure of the exact card . how do i figure that out ?
do you know what britney does with the packages which are newer in wily than in your copied wily-proposed packages
i live in sweden so first i must buy a swedish one , then i need a new screen and
well , if you ask me , i believe behind the walls they develop ways to see our computers to
can you check that the other 'normal ' albums still work ? ... then if it all works comment here
seems to be matching multiple things
i want only 64mb more .
so you suggest compiling from source rather than use the repo version ?
no one makes you act passive agressive
which grub file ?
with start-stop-daemon ?
and we did want the percona answer for our uos session so it counts as uos work ; - )
can i do that on the phone ? just for the days i 'm not home at that time
the browser
dpkg -l mlocate | pastebinit
yeah maybe
the example you gave me , are you sure i am to use the qt stuff and not the qt
the live images are for installation , not release upgrade
in some areas , but not as a software developer
it would cause the foreground app to momentarily disappear
really might be better to ask in one of the chinese language ubuntu channels . while it 's true i
they can go now , it 's all in debian git
cut that out
np : - ) it was fun !
i have limited access to that ... .it 's a bastardized power user into vcenter . the hypervisor shows link
can you prepare the fix ?
it should all be *relatively* obvious when you open up system settings and start poking around .
so it should go out where gopath is defined , then ?
yes
ok did anything show up ?
cause in normal the initrd is the first to be adjusted
i do n't see why ; lxc is a great solution for containment
right , i saw pitti but did n't dig deeper yet
ah , okay /me is not familiar with that tool , but it really should n't be directly scanning the
yes
there 's plenty of commonality , you only need the if for the bit in the middle . good programming
it 's not part of the stubbed api implementation
^
right now a developer needs to include it by hand in the push qml thing , but it 's errorprone
i am only a bot , please do n't think i 'm intelligent : )
infer randomchoice [ { 'wwitzel ' , 'ericsnow ' , 'natefinch ' , 'cherylj ' } ]
besides that gnome-shell works flawlessly ! : - )
oh got my answer from df .
it 's a standalone exe
i 'm also running an i3 in a laptop and i just tried those 2 pages you mentioned . mine
i just doubt that the ones in the apt repos have that support yet .
scp -r /var/www/html ... ...
it just joined the network while i 've asked
i could try to work-around with get_parent ( ) and get_properties ( ) but that 's far from elegant
will show in cape town
i stopped using that software . it was not lubuntu .
ok. last time i was invited via irc >
what are you using to make the usb ?
...
it 'll stick them in ~/documents for you
i 've tried the qt config gui
alan_g : a single variable that valgrind thinks is uninitialized causing a cascade of memory errors ?
it looks under tests/autopilot which matches pay-ui . so maybe i 'm mis-interpretting the error . we 'll just need
ok..
right now we do n't even know which series they are installing
would you mind if we rename the `` storage '' api to `` storagemanager '' ? there will be a
ok , i 'd ask you to comment on it at least , before i close it then
if you set the settings in the /etc/network/interfaces the networkmanager will not make the networks
that last message had me confused . do i change it bact to lts once i 'm updated ?
heh .
just about have all these changes complete , but would like to merge the templates - can a tal :
then make
i can approve it but would like someone to also review
sudo apt-get purge packagenamehere
you have a snap that makes money what printer do i need ; )
so , now let 's find out what is on the system . do `` sudo apt-get install pastebinit ''
merci : )
the small horizontal and orange bar go from left to right ( and right to left ) during some seconds
apt-get install nvidia-340 for example should work , but the driver manager in system settings should find the recommended driver
what do you see ?
okay , no curing
i dunno how to copy : /
um
yeah , that 's true , but if you install in staging , then ... . but it has still
or does it come with ubunut preinstalled ?
it sounds like a better idea , at least i can do risky stuff on btrfs .
some people think it would be better if ubuntu touch had android compatibility apps , it would be easier to
we 're volunteers , we are not employees of canonical - so it is not 'we ' at all .
im uncomfortable sharing information from log files
hmm , the format of output looks similar .
you 're not being difficult . i 'm just having trouble following what 's going on .
what is the output of grep home /usr/share/apparmor/easyprof/templates/ubuntu-core/15.04/default ?
no , meteor ones for kate
so it does actually match up against mtab then , most odd
if possible , try to reduce the aggresiveness of the on start check for new episodes to only once per
sweet
what is the exact command you ran ?
do these 13000 terminals just need a browser to work ? you do n't need docker for them . you
what /var/lib/schroot/chroots ?
not /pts , /mnt/dev/pts
is that in /bin ?
it definitely `` make ya wonder ''
so why do n't you find out before deciding to upgrade
ok. monday i 'll be giving this my full attention
ok , maybe we can talk during this friday hangout : - )
so mainly you wiped the whole chromeos ? !
btw . i do have an es cpu . if that might explain the problem at all
go in src
have you ccycled the juju-db job as well ?
there are 2 ways for otp , hotp ( as sso.ubuntu.com ) or totp ( like github )
okay good do an apt-get update
known limitation for apps not using media-hub
i use -k all
never heard your arguments about filenames before
some where in the bios ?
there 's always a way to make the version numbering work for what we need it to do , without
which ppa ?
you tell me to read the man page when it 's not even in there . you 're spreading fud
have you ever used pppoeconf ?
libc6
weird ... the test assumes the text input is empty ... but the test shows it is not ...
mmm ok - done the code side , i do n't appear to be able to delete those 3 tests
ahh , sorry : )
i 've now at least got a normalish install if you want someone to test anything re this
?
i would think that would be the best bet . shall i grab an 15.04 iso and hack that directly
just so your user has correct perms >
have you tried to update flgrx drivers and using them ?
long-term that seems fine , though
where is this profile though ?
mmm ... it works a bit too well
you ca n't tell it to bootstrap if it already is
nope
does network manager show any networks ? is this a clean 14.04.3 install ?
have you tried a different version snappy system ? i have n't looked into this at all , but maybe
and looking into two different directories will show different results .
also , you did n't drop the freebsd udebs ...
it 's about 48 minutes on tube and walking from euston and 43 minutes-ish to walk depending on how energetic
changelog should say 15.04 if you 're targetting vivid
i probably have access to the canonical aws account , but i have to find where the info is and
i know i 've spent some time reading the manpages to figure out if there 's a way to specify
the prompter i have sais : ubuntu server login ... ... username ... ... ..than asks for password ... ...
l33t ubuntu skills : p
of course
cool : )
type nano ~/.profile
alot of acpi and memory issues in your logs aswell
please change the package name in the bug so that lp dtrt
can you paste /apps/lxd/current/meta/package.yaml ?
shortcut is the right term : )
it does n't have to do with the project , i tried on several ones , i guess something wrong
i just built it from trunk
ls -al /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-content/ | pastebinit
i was managing the team doing that
i do n't mean this merge here , but the overall idea behind the strings
good to see you 're well aware of just how ridiculously complicated this all is
do you have a usb stick attached to the computer ?
which checlist ?
speaking of compilers , have you managed to hunt down why arm64 suddenly hates the kernel source ?
exit the chroot , you should get ubuntu @ ubuntu
hmm the silo is not marked as dirty , are you sure ?
let me know if any debug info could be useful . that 's on my inspiron machine so quite slow
does it work with qml ?
i thought that 's what sparse did
ok , so please push it if you can : )
ah : d
it 's a build-dependency
he weights about 200kg ... all muscules indeed : )
so use 'dd '
you 're probably just trying to join the wrong channel , which is it ?
paste output to pastebin then
no , but it might give insight as to where the bug is ; )
yeah , a little annoying . oh well .
do you think i should wo n't fix the bugs created by trigger loops ?
pkcon install-local -- allow-unauthenticated com.ubuntu.terminal_0.7.49_armhf.click
good luck with it , i 'm off to bed : )
that 's my reading of it ; i see 21 uses of .envuuid in state , and most of them
ok , thx , you might get me on mail eventually , my day is pretty much done : (
it should not work fine , there 's new api in there
was just discovering that for myself : )
bullet points fixed
fine with me : )
what ?
for the record this conversation is going in circles . for security purposes you do not give www-data sudo access
excellent , that 's kind of what i expected from ubuntu touch : ) the scopes are nice but it
anyway could i troubleshoot that ?
fixed
yeah , but after the problems with the iso/update , i was wondering if anyone tested the < new >
yes , without restart .
and do the ones which do not fail also report those changed operating definition
should use /run , not /var/run
pastebin ur etc/net/intfces file
so you want it to appear with every login ?
if you like legacy boot , you can do that also in the settings
ls -l /usr/bin/updatedb
nvm found it
can you link to it
i 'm full of them ; )
does it have to be named 1.0.3.4a ? why not 1.0.3.5 ?
and sudo apt-get update in bewteen
sounds promising : )
randomly i just could n't connect to pages , it would just keep spinning , nothing would happen with a
still there ?
looking .
the method was sound , the post might 've been about a different issue but it did n't matter
then you might wan na consider reinstalling 14.04 or wait till next week to install 15.04
gilir has provided two choices for people to play with : an lxqt-metapackage in our daily ppas and a lubuntu-next
not store
: )
mousepad from my perspective is mostly enhanced menu options - obviously a text editor is a text editor
they 're probably also fine where they are ( in the uniter package )
no , but if you are it can be useful to integrate with lightning in thunderbird
yey \o/
yes , itz is
i want the live cd to autorun it when it is done
9999
maybe your 'older ' screen cant handle the monster card
it will be difficult to break something by mistyping an etherwake command , do n't worry about it
ok , it is working = )
next britney run will re-trigger them
to allow to theme the track independently from the slider when on-hover ...
then i click on 'i 'm a new user '
ah i see .
krb5-locales is by default ... -user , i do n't think so
what should i paste then
well , i guess i meant , is the text-based installer itself a package that i could install into the
elemental ?
a full export takes how long now ? some 6 hours ?
ok , ping me if you need any other `` help '' ; - )
just know that this is a support channel ; )
ty : )
no , but your alternatives ( plugina || pluginb ) can both do [ install ] wantedby=the-main-one
i mean , making the suggested change
it was me
no permissions to access phone this way
/var/log/syslog or the log viewer icon
noo , it 's just a place to point people to that information
totes just you bro
echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online to disable core 3
indeed .
would that actually be less code ?
oh , you seem like the sort of person who knows this arcana :
192.168.122.2 blog.redemptionsong
what driver are you using now ?
you have a png for every occasion ?
because i work since 14h and cant type anymore
looks like we just/recently introduced that breakage ; i 've asked smoser to take a look .
earlier , did you move the $ home/.config.old/ directory back to $ home/.config ?
yes
everything is installed under / but this system was installed on raid 0.. no encryption , no lvm
sorry , i know nothing of the mac hardware .
i love u. : d
click on `` disable '' or disable the wifi in the bios , or use the function keys to turn
it can only be src/platforms/android/ really
whats the module name ?
thx
what version of ubuntu is this
yeah there 's a buffer at 5 silos , if there 's only 5 free silos then you need a
ok
it 's very likely your package set is screwed , there 's something totally weird going on , i did
the best way is to do an empty merge
who is the mentor ?
no they do n't
ping
do you have a connection to the internet at those times ?
just copy sept 's ?
this server was working a few weeks without restart . in this time there were several kernel updates , but
what are the mount options ? noexec
i assumed because the phones are 15.04 it needed to be that .
i thought this is what we talked about in the meeting this morning ?
that is not what he said ... he said he got an e-mail that stated it was patched , he
can you add `` prey '' to things that need porting .
it wont be cause it will be a neoscoin
mistery
great , sure go ahead ! ; )
yes
if and i do say if this is an acer laptop with uefi firmware , there are issues with vendor
yes
'purple screen ' is usually the plymouth 'splash ' screen . ideally , pressing 'esc ' will dismiss it and
are you on 15.04 ?
why not install from the repositories ?
yes , theme ... do you still see them ?
14.10 docs are still there , just not aliased to `` current '' anymore
ok , type mkdir /boot/efi/efi
does it look like a reasonable thing to do in windows ?
it 's because of the location prompt
forget it , it was an expected error
just do it all yourself
you 'll be installing a work-in-progress development kernel , so you must expect issues . it 's release-candidate 4 and
ok so i got somthing like : vga compatible controller : nvidia corporation gm107 [ geforce gtx 750 ti ]
does it happen all the time or only if you have a lot of apps open ?
i can do it ... just saying it used to be easier is all .
probably . are you looking into the bug we were talking about the other day ?
yeah
when is the fix landing ? ; - )
unfortunately not : ( i got the desktop mode enabled on my nexus 4 with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse
from which scope to which ?
silo 57 contains ubuntu-touch-session
well , the problem is that maas now needs to behave differently based on the release it is installing
so if i change iso to an img , i can boot it that way ?
music , videos and documents that you put on the sd should just show up everywhere automatically , the system
you got a usb pendrive you can erase completly ?
+1
would be nice if you could find out what on your system claims to be a mouse
see dh_python3 ( 1 )
so another thing that may have come up but when you connect when roaming you see r
i guess you dont have that enabled in kerne then ...
it can be , it depends
ooooh ! i did n't know about that .
there is a trick you can play ; edit parts/ < part-name > /state to be 'pull ' iirc and
does it hurt to ask ?
exactly what i would have thought with grub.cfg , but c_minus tells us it did not work , so i
the indicator-messages testplan needs to be updated , should atleast contain a testcase for the fixed bug in silo 18
so you do n't want the ubuntu patches on top of the beagleboard kernel
oldskool boy : p
no idea what 's going on there .
i 'm noticing something in firefox ... the tearing in pages when scrolling seems to start after watching videos on
then what do i install it as ?
okay , but your output looks like /dev/sdb is what 's causing the issues .
i usually wget my key from launchpad ; )
yes the install appeared to be good .
: )
huh , it seems that it should be possible to do a sync from proposed
i can see how that might work , in that most commercial work is not allowed to be shared ,
yeah
which wget = > /usr/bin/wget
we can keep going around in circles but i already answered what you are now asking - ( 20:42:03 )
are you confusing yourself again ?
the live-usb/cd contains an installer ; )
well i 'll be damned , that worked .
then install ubuntu , and make it look like it
no
it 's my pc at home
replace the disk .
did i explain that clearly ?
check in `` man xrandr '' for the -- set option
agreed for order , but not arity
yeah - some php mods need it , others do n't
i did n't know that command - cheers for that : )
and will be tricky if it 's actually a bug in 1.20
~ is just a shortcut for /home/yourusername
however , either we add a separate app or put that into the settings app
im saying , we can try everything we can to make your system work
the driver manager in the system settings
ok
you are not supposed to run a desktop as root on ubuntu . so it doesnt matter if the screensaver
lau ?
just fyi , gon na dump josh 's screen shot fixes in there ( usc included )
yes , let me just rebuild the click from trunk now that it is landed and i will push
you can use 'do-release-upgrade ' on the command line
so that includes all your lamp stuff whatever
im starting an own store next years , thats why im interested
yes i forgot my teminology .
nope , does n't work for me
but we shoudl do sthing about that
just do n't scorch it
so just when wrapped in avchd ?
in *theory* , if the gpu is fully supported . however , sometimes 'nomodeset ' is used due to getting
that distinction seems subtle , so juju is not an orchestrator but a language runtime for orchestrator ?
really depends on what they are named and what you want them to be named , but easy to adapt
and mir just works ? i 'm getting connection issues
what do you need ?
anyhow , the updates lists are smallish , i 'm fine with just including them .
bear in mind i 'm probably 6-7 hours ahead of you ( in england ) and i 've been programming
fstab is indeed using device nodes and not uuids .
i can get in via our ssh bouncer
to fix it i did a watch only rebuild , sorted it all out ( for future reference )
did you check with is regarding the hosting on help.u.c ?
the launcher is a system profile , so its cache file is in /etc/apparmor.d/cache
can u hear us ?
$ ( end of line ) becomes - $ ret ( -lts-utopic )
right ; right now we do n't support network device paths
yep i do ( that 's how i 'm on irc now , via weechat-curses ! )
not a server here
^
yeah saw the smily , but words on teh screen alone are not enough to convey such things , so
the following packages will be removed : system-image-cli ubuntu-touch
rsync or clone ?
upping the scale factor in the unity-control-settings-panel make things look right
so , ill not make comments about the aestethic properties of that conflict display but omg , what a dumb
klibc being the candidate
well , midori is very light , indeed .
a word of warning if you have genuine windows 7 and are eligible for that free upgrade to windows 10
well , *if* the session is active , we have to satisfy the client requirement
think of them stapled now . the last one mounted is the one you see now .
k1l_ > in terminal : `` ls -al '' does everything there belong to user : user ?
just found it ^_^ yes , i switched it to 'legacy bars '
confirm systemd looks good on ubunut mate 15.04 currently : )
you said you hahd a purple screen a minute ago
good : )
that 's not official , mate .
the difference is that an inch of snow where you are vanishes the same or next day . in calgary
try either , up to you . do n't set the same settings as above on wired though
what is the current kernel u are working on ?
apps are n't allowed to touch anything that they do n't own
guess bluesabre would have to answer that ...
just give me a number when all is done .
so we run snappy build .
thats a install target
bah , we 've lost the slot . are you really concerned about showing it tuesday ?
but with java certificates depend on keystore configured
i added you to -dev , so yeah , update the ppa info
ok i 'll take that in too
there is a really fishy/broken thing in nm-wait-online.service , so i wanted to check first
how ?
first thing to do is consult the syslog to discover *why* dhcp client is n't obtaining a lease
figured you were .
in that case you can simply ignore this change ; )
agreed
ok. are they both laptops ?
good point
and pastebin of the above
yup ! just connected it to a screen and pressed enter . and now on the productionserver it upgraded perfectly
yes . bootmgfw.efi.backup
nope , i 've waited 2 minutes and nothing , also the ui is in a strange state , if
why dropping that from .chroot ?
unity swithcer/
woohoo uname reports 3.13.0-49-generic
mvo iirc
yes , in sdb4 there is a folder named casper , full path is /media/root/multibootusb/lxle-14.04.3-64bit/casper
because it 's nft - it 's being mounted as a userspace mount
ubucon was fantastic
right
unity-lens-applications

how much ram in in your system ?
you ever used a spider kvm ?
ah : - )
ok , now lets look at what kernel+initrd images are actually installed . please show us `` pastebinit < (
also is someone working on 14.4.5 ? i noticed the tarballs are up . after i finish my current list
right but what do you want , domain.com = wordpress , or domain.com/wordpress = wordpress ? : )
all sound , do you use ubuntu or windows ?
it just says fatal and something regarding /dev/sdb . i ca n't help with that .
cool you are under support . is wait you seeing in the update packaged held ?
but since i do n't hear the dvd spinning anymore ... i doubt it 'll go any further ...
ok in the terminal do : sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel
we can blame my internet then : )
that 's fine
`` cat /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades '' you 'll see `` prompt=lts ''
a wild guesstimated pessimistic average between a lot of packages just doing `` depends : @ '' and some needing
the ubuntu ops are more than reasonable , are you sure you did n't ?
are you testing on a composited wm ?
ah . see my link above .
w.r.t . this mp , any suggested next steps ?
a wife that heals you on arena duels xd
i meant the hw
check .
try `` sudo cp -r /media/numbus/lacie /home/nimbus/desktop ; chown -r nimbus : nimbus /home/nimbus/desktop ''
and it does work but the connection is just bad ?
it used to happen to me in older releases too .
or chmod +x path/to/foo.jar
it 's just not /guaranteed/ to be okay .
where can i do that ?
and if you try like 'ping 8.8.8.8 ' ?
but if your a dev , thats being like an inventor right ?
putra in sanskrit and putra/beta in hindi
yes , ondrej
when you learn for yourself do you actually follow guides and manuals or keep guessing ? ; )
i use ip cam as end users and i ca n't see them in the server neither outside : (
do we need this anyway ?
you have not installed what drivers ? the nvidia ones ?
we do have an initramfs zswap hook but , confusingly , we only use it in the installer . and
running out of space ? where ?
what should i do ?
it 's supposed to be run by the session launched from gdm ?
we 're not faces in general ; )
okay , so this will be a problem for me then ... for example , i need wi-fi ( wpa_supplicant
no idea you 'll have to wait and see : )
is there a way to remove an image from the channel easily ?
i meant `` wake up '' in a totally figurative way : )
any of the current xubuntu iso should work on both pre and post efi/uefi
correct
note : updated model to be released any day now
morning : )
yes
but why is it build on my system ?
just out of curiosity , at this point how many kernels do you have installed ?
i 'm using a mix of m300 and m400 ... but , i have n't even gotten to the point
well , i have the unfounded feeling that vfat causes many of our issues ...
what kind of card did you have ( sudo lshw -c video )
ok , i 'll follow up with is on that today then
good . just making sure it is n't sda . : )
because for live systems a different bootloader is used depending on if you 're booted via uefi or via bios
no idea : ) i would look that up , but since we can both google ... that one i
mirv we did n't have much to discuss anyway . verify that next krillin build is still good , nothing
that might be too much effort to save 8 characters .
private == personal
but that is not a beginners task
so i have to update the cache as well on each existing alarm update ...
well i can compile it from source gosh darnit
well i 'd only recommend it if your pc is locking up
[ root @ guest ~ ] # fstrim -v /
r250 from ~5min ago fixes it
yes
the directories , yes .
it does . it also does n't contain the eglimage compositing path to composite correctly with a qpa plugin that
whell , there are two options , one is to remove transmission , and qbittorent will be set default |
what client r u using .
and if the theme name is used to build up the path , then qfile : : encodename ( )
so , we have 4 setstatus methods in state
can you paste the app log
ok , i can do rebuilds
no worries , elfy already ( successfully ) tested , so i 'd say you can wait until there 's
so names.tag is an object that is generally used in clients , i believe
then also change listspacesresults ' results field to be of type listspacesresult ( or whatever ) , which has a
if you conclude too that it does n't look it 's reverting anything , we might just publish it and
do you type with ten fingers ?
your card is optimus ?
true , i guess wayland will not be a full xserver replacement for at least 3-5 years
krita_1 % 3a2.8.6-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb < -- this is after purge . so whats the point of purge then remove ?
ah , it this boottesting a new thing ?
ah , ok - let 's call them machinenetworkconfigresult etc . as the type names do n't matter
from the top of my head i can think of the checkout-lock-held semantics
why do n't you know what script you added @ boot ?
err , quite busy today . doing some server upgrades .
webdm sounds rather complext
what version of ubuntu ?
ideally you 'd put the drive into an external enclosure that is usb connected - that 'd get it recognized
i'mm reboot and do the intremap=no_x2apic_optout trick
not the general theme , the indicators theme
how would i make that work on boot ?
i would try the nomodeset or try a xubuntu/lubuntu , see if it makes any difference
that 's completely unrelated , it 's saying there 's an issue with bind9 - so if you use that
should be ok
can you get more verbose output please . the unity8 output
i dunno ... system configuration ?
that should be asked in # ubuntu+1 though i bet there 's answers on the net for it xd
im going to pretend i didnt heard that . ; ) haha
which version of ubuntu ?
ok , if it does n't work you can try to add the entry with the windows path
ah boo
your laptop needs a dhcp client , not a server .
yeah try that : d
how would you do what i did with standard regex ?
i apt-get upgrade ?
unfortunately the whole package is a bit nasty since the dkms build wgets some firmware on build time . but
do you know if this is reported by bq ?
: d
i would expect debian to have the same issue with fakechroot , so perhaps reproduce there , and maybe then
in the absence of a relative or absolute path , the current directory is used , and if the file
which might point to something racey going on .
so you 're down for it ? : d
it just restarts the scopes ui and should be enough to unlock you
yep , that one
sure you ran `` sudo apt-get update '' ?
huh . no idea what that error is as it 's from steam , not ubuntu . but sudo apt-get
while it 's burning a little question about booting through usb drive
np
or /etc/environment .
sounds real specific
not all lts are , but that 's your choice
you mean like netflix ?
is that ok with you ? i do n't think it should be that hard to write
qtmir has to know a bit about focus , to tell the client `` your window is focused ''
you could try reporting a bug and see if someone responds : p
i dont get it
to get rid of my 128bg ssd in my second machine running windows 7
you mean me ?
i would n't have added it if ubuntu had cinnamon in the repos : )
you can see the amazon search en on the left , not `` amazon is installed '' .
so now let 's alter it to *read* from the source pc 's disk : instead of `` if=/dev/zero ''
should be reconfigured and ready to build
alt+left arrow ?
is that a fix needed in later releases ?
graphing of gas pressure versus temperature
rich text editor
which file ? 90-cloudimg-ubuntu ?
nice
this is not the right place for this kind of opinions
you are marvelous !
meaning the fix i backed out ? or the fix to fix the fix ? : )
you are rude , care little for anyone else but yourself
yeah fn + f5 or some
oh ok
well , that and it does n't ( staging ) build ppc64el
ok let me rephrase - anything i can do to be useful that involves a script ?
so true
packaged and uploaded manually ? or just click on something that makes it available there ?
the same applies for other os .
pastebin it
yeah only i did n't know about it so install expecting 163 fortunately i notice the new icons and shell
may be try creating the emulator again ? `` ubuntu-emulator create testemulator ''
mirv : as i mentioned above , the page explains how this looks like in our case
would it have failed if there was another version of u-s-s still in wily-proposed ? ( which was the case
yes , but then you 'd have to do one of two things

i dont think so

lol
no , rf kill just turns the radios off , but the device is still there and seen by the

no i mean the choice when you pick new simple
ok
( still catching up after holidays )
for a better hello world example , download the ubuntu sdk
yeah yeah , i 'm just waiting for you ... ; )
sure i did set different ld_library_path by creating a wrapper script to set it , then launch my applciation .
not at root .
/usr/bin/python : no module named liblo ; 'oscar ' is a package and can not be directly executed
lol good night
also where do you see those folders
oh wait , i will join yours : )
you can re-ask once in a while here
the snappy team has that in their backlog
so where 's the problem ?
ah , ok , great tip , thanx !
you know what happened with that inquiry ? ( lack of a better word )
2 years to migrate always feels like a lot ... until it becomes 2 weeks
aha , forsooth !
yeah : -p
but to avoid future panic , i 'd like mdadm -- assemble -- scan to work ...
cool
i am unable to click on the `` visit homepage '' buttons
did you do some research for the package you are trying to install ?
does a guest login work ?
it 's a shame you may not be sure of how it was when it worked , as you could
not really , but better double-check the contents of those pinning files and see that the silo pin number is
i did configure syncevolution to have my owncloud synced

when you get a chance , could you email michael hall and me with the tv rental info ?
it 's the sound wave of the song , is n't it ?
it probably is a hd / memory issue
ok , that is good
i ca n't even find bugs by title sometimes
okay
so all is fine ?
salem_ is working on it , fixing a bug bfiller found
well not on unity , but you can install kde or kubuntu-desktop sure
no , i kept the ubuntu standard setup . but even without that , it should have worked on your
jibel : no bad feeling , but that is the dark side of the cherry picking what people consider as
first : then mkdir somewhere
i guess the dependencies branch also needs updating
could you also help to review other patches for trusty ?
i mean that if i activate bluetooth n-m and bluetoothd sigtrap/sigsegv
i ca n't see anything obviously wrong with the streams , did you pastebin a failing bootstrap with -- debug

what ubuntu is it exactly ?
where did you look ? both /var/spool/cron/crontabs/ and /etc/cron* ?
hmm , why would it say that
so , where are qml files stored ?
same thing just now it blinked some screen for a milisecond
did you install the propietary softward already ?
to mount ext4 formated sd-card in a running system is no problem .
in any case i 'm going to add something to your page ; - )
either your friend is wrong or he explained it poorly .
and this is all targeted for ota8 right ?
alright , i 'll give it a try . and would you happen to know how i can display the
but the snap stuff is interessting as well
hopefully that does it : )
i dont have a kb attached to the pc
i suggest you `` sudo apt-get install pastebinit '' if you have n't already : )
you have 13gb of disk space free ? ? what `` programming '' do you think will use up 14gb
writing some javascript stuff
yes , those should have been dependency waits but were bitten by a known launchpad-buildd bug . both retried .
type `` lspci '' into a terminal and show us the output in a pastebin
connections must be fine ... the battery is talking to the pc over the iic communications bus
you mean the phone roadmap ?

possibly it fails to resume some device

wafflejock : should i use sudo mkfs.vfat -f 32 -n windows /dev/sdb1 ?
so ... in short you dunno ?

i 'm really hoping it will make 14.04.2 . if you think you can get to it next week ,
yes thats too - he sent me the details
ok just wondering if it was a latest wow around here
we 've introduced shadow build support in vivid , and that means some heavy changes in the scripts , project
hrmph ... i 've definitely had test.v be the difference between no output and some output , when specifying check.vv
`` keep the locales that are in that main-countries list or have a matching dir in /usr/share/locale-langpack . ''
ah a vm , do you have a snapshot of it working or a backup ?
lightdm is not start with upstart . why not mistake &
yeah i ran into the same issues
that sounds really good , i am really looking forward to meeting many of you kubuntu guys n girls
you are first time on this channel or i havent noticed you before ?
no its not possible , i have to reboot my mac to boot lubuntu on the external harddrive
stop pressing enter . it is spammy and irritating .
as in you add-machine , then go fiddle with it , then deploy onto them ?
14.04
oh , so i wo n't get any problem in the future ?
much better name for wily too ; )
such as if im already backdoored on a computer that is on the network ? in which case im screwed
ahhh , south-east linux fest
you can ask valorie or mamarok : p
and in fact phablet-test-run is semi-deprecated so unless you 're using your own tool also to deploy/execute the tests (
you can ask any questions
`cat > ~/.ssh/id_rsa < < - eom` does the same thing : (
running ubuntu on them also
ta
but if we ca n't resolve sparkling-wine.maas ( e.g . we 're not using the maas dns server on the
are frameworks well defined ? is it okay for a framework to ship a language runtime ?
nope
i do n't like to generalise
yeah
the mic is not detected or input is not detected ?
launchpad says the bug you 're describing is fixed with linux 3.13.0-29.53
however , the mouse issue is in unity stuff , like the dash or where ?
also i 'm trying a much lower res to have a higher framerate
yes .
dual band ? no
did you go to the intel site and instal their gpu driver ?
i like having some information already in the package , shall we leave a bit and point to the website
do n't beat around the bush ; how do you really feel ?
that was unnecessary
this is for testing only , if you like lubuntu/work good sure clean install
for a start , how about running `` ubuntu-bug audio '' and point me to the resulting bug ?
i tested it several days ago ; if you have n't changed anything since then , then i 'll mark
well then you have to look for a ppa yourself , they are not supported here
i will see what i can do to get you some more insight
ok , will do .
do you get a login shell eventually ?
am i right in seeing we 're mostly of the hook for rtm ? i.e . there 's nothing we
i did n't notice , but i agree
so you 're suggesting i drop 046 ( which would need fixing anyway as per above ) and manually bump
no , the interfece is different , too
that 'd be unlikely though anyway , but for gathering knowledge
might give you a better idea of whats hogging up resources
ok
good luck
can you show me , from the remote host , `` ls -altr $ home/.ssh/ ''
hoping maybe there 's an update to the usb device tables .
i 'm using unity on 14.04.1
how would i apply chmod o-r to only files that are drwxrwxr-x to drwxrwxr -- x in the folder ?
opened
i know , it 's been far too long since i 've seen you
it only installs a script that pulls in the client to your ~/ , and steam keeps itself up-to-date .
you know ?
^
laptop
at runtime you mean because they get compiled
ugh , gon na have to read through the script then i guess
ctl+alt+f1-f6 , then login , then run sudo systemctl enable sddm , then startx
you can try installing the wine-development package , which is 1.7.29 ( in vivid )
'cause they want you to think you 're getting your money 's worth
all working fine here on xenial
well , ask the real question and see if we can get back on topic
one question regarding api errors . they have a message and a code . if an operation on state returns
i pushed it , revision 20 . it should have a stable menu system . no run configuration atm ,
ok , done
on the fsck , yeah . please = )
i will try to finish tomorrow , and get the odt doc to you
ok cool . how would i do that ?
hm - that means we 'll always have to mirror the themes , right ?
i do n't see it showing up in component-mismatches . oh , cause you reverted .
can you add a `` consider encryption '' in the hygiene part ? i 'll fill it later : p
could be something going wrong with your current user , we would know at least
i hear you . if serverpilot goes away , what will take to unplug your vps 's from it and
it 's really not .
e : could n't find any package by regex 'nvidia-prime-upstart.log '
would you start one please ?
wlan0 is present now ... but not connected
if yes : see what exact laptop/system you got and if there is a known solution . because that is
dns ?
there are some that i am still trying to figure out how to fix , some that require something to
where ? you have to restart the service after reconfiguring
type md5sum -c /media/toshiba/32gb\ usb/md5sum.txt | nc termbin.com 9999
the password will always be the same right ? it 's stored on the user , not the envuser .
ta . looks like /sys/class/backlight/.. has a brightness option which works .
not a fix , just a sync
so , back to my initial question , what 's your ultimate goal here ? restriction of outbound traffic ,
really ? hmm , it 's recommended online vs itunes in wine *shrug*
yeah really nice ... .. *facepalm*
already the newest version
ok will do if i see it in time
so chnnels are now happy ?
ack , i 'll be poking those other teams too
left speaker stopped working and the right one has a temperament now too
dekko for email
if anything does not make sense or is not intuitive . that 's why we are here !
some cases , the open one works *great* , and best.. some cases.. not at all.. some cases , nvidia
bubbasaures , i know but i have a coding bootcamp in 6 hours and ca n't do a system rebuild
but , i want the file to be owned by www-data , does it even matter really ?
after restricted extras , try firefox from terminal
so you could make it work only by key auth ( and make sure you dont loose you key :
yes you pasted that already
from live usb ?
ok , press ctrl+alt+del
on it..
the release cycle is shorter , that would be a factor , but again you are not on ubuntu ,
pastebin the output of this command ... `` smbclient -l 192.168.1.1 ''
right now it sounds like that works as expected
why are applications and setup on one page ?
if everything is installable building from the ppa can be an option
i had n't noticed that before so it wierded me out
what is the commandline ?
yeah ive tryed , but it says wrong login
im not worried about that . i 've dealt with the `` boot device not found '' error a million
could you change your system language to english and show me the error message
indeed and i am sure it will come in handy : )
now you 're doing it every two weeks ?
sure thing
not until the default vala version ( defined by who builds the valac binary ) changes .
if we run a vivid slave with upstart then it may make sense to use a feature flag to indicate
so , since you 're worrying about nginx/vivid ( which looks ready today ) , can i bug you to
compiz/unity rebuild/fixes for gcc5 are in silo43 it seems , check with bregma when he plans to land it i
how is the outside world going to get to this box ?
if you recently pulled 1.23 , can you then push -f your branch and just fix it ? i doubt
i 'd hose the ext4 first ... since we dunno what happend before , and delete also the swap one
yes , well , see backlog
no worries , i expect asynchronicity : )
right . should be a standard setup
the actual misbehaviour is going to be a combination of kmod and linux , in that either kmod 's being
yes . i prefer it , easier to collect information especially remotely
been there . really was n't any better for stability
yup , it 's gone lol
but when apt-get install ubuntu-sdk-ide was used it went fine and it did remove the conflicting packages . no idea
isnt that the ubuntu 1 thing ?
that is just a wrong advice , mioso
you just should n't do it
then see `` dmesg '' what the issue is
yes i have those two files .
on install , first we unpack , then we do some checks , then we stop the old version and
no worries , just shame we could n't get it totally fixed
can you rephrase ?
oh ok , i misunderstood . i thought it was already a merge and you just added another merge
one more q. any plans for gesture writing the way you have an on android keyboard
i am not really an expert , got stuck with this
all 0 's
all spaceinfo will have is a name and a [ ] subnetinfo
there may not actually be a seperate deb
this is not meant to be quality , just enough to work
so seems to be a problem with the indicator
that 's only your opinion
ok. what roughtly is the publisher interval ?
one , but not wireless
what do you get if you say `` sudo sc-logresolve '' ?
please wait 176 minutes for test to complete .
it 'd be good to know what it 's conflicting with , that might give us a better approach
nothing about infinite loops in syslog
is n't it more like 27.000 devices a day
cool , copied . now if you go to that dashboard link i pasted , click 'build ' , check
i 'm sure you can figure that out , its not an ubuntu support question so it does n't really
: once i am in software and updates.. where do i go ? which tab do i click on ?
but you got ta understand plasma 5 is new , there are going to be bugs . best way to
ca n't imagine facebook and youtube running very well on that
a framework is there to provide a service to apps . a framework most often needs privileged access to something
done
that 's lengthy when i have multiple shells : )
oh yes ! alot of them actually . from my many attempts i suppose
do n't use ue tmpfs locally and why would it be different ?
right but there has been no result
is it possible to be fixec ?
menno and i worked on it originally when we migrated the collections to multi envs
hey ! it 's a bit different
was hoping you knew . ; )
how is he having trouble getting .odt files ?
ok ... all those `` hdmi max tmds frequency 230000khz '' suggest a bad or plain incorrect edid
np
show me the output of uname -a please
meh missed you message too busy writing the bug ; )
should you not use apt-cache policy ubuntu-sdk ?
but did we not start this with you asking me if i was totaly up to date , and you
yup , got it installing now
who ? bucky ?
because you told him not to set a passphrase with key generation
yep ... didnt look there yet
i did assist by suggesting an app you 've already tries .
ah , ok , got it again now
therefore that 'll say `` use the v4 ''
you 're mixing up fakechroot and fakeroot .
btw , i got the u-c-c work from larsu working , there were some packaging tweaks to do and it
i would think so but i 'll do it again to be sure
youtube-dl ?
it is a generic build
( contrary to requires= )
well , you know , if you have x86 machine it 's a bit hard for that cpu to eat
yeah , right : )
now when i run ifconfig
windows share ; )
would n't hurt to get rid of some of those older ones too , `` sudo apt-get autoremove '' may
we 're not that fortunate . ; - )
themue , just give me 3 mins and i 'll be there
it 's not a complete cover at all . you are deluded
i do n't think so , maybe i am not following the steps correctly , i ll try again
ah , ok . i just thought it 'd need me to do some action on my side to enable
attach external usb 3.0 ... expand raid1 to two devices , let it sync , shrink it again to 1
everything else there under params besides properties is basically a leaky implementation or duplicate info
you should be able to override it by adding it to the gadget ( and that would be supported in
and yes , the plan is to have juju 2.0 in xenial and then backported to trusty
ahh ... you are my hero , ha
have you tried adding `` position_fix=1 '' as an option on the snd_hda_intel module ?
iirc you get a question where to install grub .
no i did n't mean to say you need steamos . but the fact that steam is making consoles based
lots of programs will make a config for the user if one is n't present the first time they run
ill be honest here , the only git guis that i liked where for osx
i prefer midori . it has adblock it 's lightweight . i have made midori to identify as iphone :
hopefully by 16.10 ... can someone confirm ? wxl ianorlin holstein
usb otg is generally not supported . some things may work . some bt keyboards may work as well ,
oh no
thnx : d
i 'm left with a blank screen then , since i do n't have a working tty
samsung has several `` 4 '' s
for me `` sudo ibus list-engine '' worked fine .
plus nuage has three additional charms for openstack to implement their sdn
control c is how i `` kill '' terminal processes.. what are you doing ? and why ?
even last week when jenkins was all green ?
is this a full desktop system ?
not anymore , that was the whole point of the exercise - it uses its own apiserver facade
do n't know .
really ?
he 's wanting to switch to ubuntu
do you know have serial console : ) ?
there 's like a 0 % chance of that being a thing
totally .
wise decision
there is - and you 're looking at it , they just do n't need any active cooling : )
within a profile you can specify the name to transition to
yeah , exactly that
ack , i thought about something officially google
my future plan is to run an ubuntu store
it works though if i wrote it this way : ppid=`cat $ pid_file_primary` ; touch /tmp/foobar_ $ { ppid }
eh , no , only ci-train-ppa-service ( aka trainguards ) and core dev can upload to silos .
no . the thing is that a lot of programs/processes were merged into systemd . so until 15.04 the maintainer
yes closed ones are hidden . but fear no , if you go to you user page , and look
what does it mean standard ? : d go to system setting , software and updates , and addictional drivers
dpkg -l | grep utopic
you tried both keys mshift as well ?
this is where the fun begins !
to do what exactly
oke , so remove that ppa with `` sudo ppa-purge ppa : belin/trusty `` and logout/login other desktop
as i can likely get that changed quickly
in /var/log/syslog i can see cron [ 809 ] : ( root ) cmd ( sh /root/script.sh ) but the
please see my private message
the store at least booted you because of that , did you manually install ?
thats still running as root .
yes now its showing the names of all network .
oh , if he 's actually referring to gfxboot ? maybe .
without address allocation we just ask the provider for the inferface info
no just saves the url and closes the process down for rendering and all i believe , you can tell
the thing is , i already added support for linux 4.2 . maybe one of those changes was pulled into
and yeah , getting new laptop beats destroying a throwaway vm any time : )
mysql-client-core-5.6 and mysql-server-core-5.6
linux box ?
uhm , the name is ugly but i can live with that if i can find a way to assign
is there a bug filed for that yet ?
meaning the `` time to alarm '' delta value is incorrect..so may be the fault function is alarmutils.get_time_to_next_alarm ) _
anything show up if you run `` dpkg -l | grep bcm '' ?
you should be able to
ok install virt-manager , odd that one has to scroll to the bottom of the page for the key app
sorry not had a chance to look at it yet
yeah , it 's definitely the cause of your pain . we used to remove old kernels from proposed ,
byobu is a wrapper around gnu screen or tmux . if you are n't familiar with them , i highly
look'n . be back in a bit .
you sure ? have you done it yourself ?
your only hope with that is a distro that is meant to work out of the box . i would
but it 's a dual boot system , i have a server running some things via windows on this machine
would be good if you have another sims to try
no , that 's the trick , this error happens when mounting the volume
everything needs to be loaded into the ram . and most usb drives are very very very very very slow
test pprior to covering it all up , huh ?
if the package continues to be held back then there are dependencies and libs required which are n't available yet
have you included `` allow from all '' in the < directory /home/ngc3982/public_html > stanza ?
ok , so hookcontext is not just a jujuc.context
correct
did you try the nosplash option too ?
does the live-cd/dvd run the os if you choose `` try kubuntu '' ?
oh ! ! ! ! this is a 64-bit kernel is n't it ?
hmmm
we have been testing silos that are not critical
hellow : p
im actually at work so i gottastep away for a min
you best tell us which so we do n't just repeat then
network speed : )
ok , just give me the link and i 'll handle it
well , refactored qmltest.cmake
are you using an msdos or gpt disk label on this drive ?
# idname , .classname ?
i would be too ashamed , sorry : p
yes , or use the system 's own manager for that with `` dpkg-divert -- local -- divert /usr/bin/apt-get.real --
it 's usually between 80mb/s and 100mb/s
cyphermox : the good new is it is on the usb stick as there is no wifi setup , and
you can tell it to exclude some parts of the project for scannning too but not a free option
it wo n't try to run a txn ...
i did fix broken packages , it removed 12 packages and fixed nothing
please pastebin the output of `` nmcli dev list '' .
you upload to the store as well ?
what is the output of : cat /etc/issue
what 's more , it is n't the mainview that rotates - the *window* rotates
let me do that
woops , yes
so is root root
correct , 20 april was before enabling that
so seeds definitely dont support multiarch ... ( i asked cjwatson ) ...
`` lspci -nn '' output for that device would also be excellent , since it gives the pci id
to lightdm.conf , i 've tried it before
can you check if rsyslogd/syslogd is installed/running ?
also try to say explicitly : 'kbuildsyscoca4 -- noincremental '
you know what i mean mate , most reccomended
no
hola
i 'm eod , but rcj might be able to point you at them . : )
did you take a look into unity-tweak-tool ?
( yeah , makes sense , i had just assumed that there was efi/bios magic that did something something *waves
no it 's not
it has _not_ different repos
the server with problems is a vm which ins't booting . i then boot it with the install disk ,
dont do that !
yeah ...
ah , hmm , it seems i have an old repo that 's overriding the ubuntu ones : )
i know , the question is can i get rid of the libqapt 2 package
oh , no , it 's a ) succeeded ( ca n't be retried ) , b ) published ,
yup the rsync is only latest version , while deja has version history
but why would speed be related to truncating by a few thousand bytes ?
done
stupid question , but i assume those yellow dots are part of the wallpaper , not rendering artifacts from the
even without the qa side of things , it can help from an advocacy/marketing perspective by showing that it 's
it 's probably all the chroots it has to measure , poor mako
you can search for `` fail : '' to see the details
you 'll get juju-br-eth0.42 ( i.e . , bridged )
my assumption is the gui does in fact work , but this use of python-jujuclient does n't
i can fully connect now , but my users report having been in the entire time
oh ... ok ... you can also check nsswitch.conf ( do n't edit it until you are sure of what
one side thing : in ual , suspend/resume and setting of the oom score are one operation
/run/mir_socket maybe ?
can you check with alex about the state and location of the js scopes api docs ?
yes , that was when i tried booting from the usb innstaller for 14.04.3 i had just created using he
i have `` put the computer to sleep when inactive for '' set to `` never '' . could this
yes , we temporarily had a mixed view which was a hack .
do you have any idea why would it fail to load the library ? ?
ah , heh did n't realise it was already being used ; cool
where can i find out how to use quickutils.inputmethodprovider ? a quick google glance did n't return any doc results
which one ?
what ?
on second thought , it gives a clear message : do n't edit these pages , it 's reverted every
at the moment , just trying to limit a user to no shell , ssh tunnel/socks only
everything i have is on my localhost still , sorry
although i had a usb installed when i `` fixed '' grub
lsusb -v should give more info
you could turn off apparmor i guess to confirm it 's not blocking
its not there , just logged out agai
pass to terminal
better to fix that after release then ?
no , wierd thing is also , we have a raid which is no longer showing up in df ,
aye , i 'll just attempt with latest arch linux version then
myself and john-mcaleely tried it and while we agree ux could be better its ok for now
ctrl alt right click does nothing . alt right click doesminimize maximize move and always on top
hmm.. problematic to write the client code without the endpoint args available
what is dual boot ?
i guess it 's more one for andyrock though ?
that can be helpful as you get all mouse events as touch
and we do n't have anything like that
do i have to run a 'chown ' ?
you are the 1 me
i never run this card in linux .
i had started to do it myself on a vm but got tired of waiting for it lol
there 's no point touching it now it 's been dd 'd , just leave it alone ...
but it 's only in 1.23 and master
can you try a different usb ?
since it 's not in the archive yet and we 'd like some docs published *somewhere* this week , what
tried manually selecting what drive to boot from as well in bios ( one time boot )
put a good bit of ram towards the vm though - it 's not vm friendly in low-ram
indeed , that 's the worst thing you can do in front of someone who obsesses over small things !
you have n't experienced magic until you have used qemu-static
right , misinterpreted that maybe in the backlog
do you have openvpn installed ?
ok that should work too .
yeah , most likely oomed
he did yes , which is why i said `` i wonder if we should resume that discussion ''
you 're right , i have a desktop pc , with nvidia , and the problem is the same
is dropping letters in your lordship ?
no firewall , router does n't block anything , works fine on different computer ( same network )
+1
hah , easy -- that used autoconf , not ./setup.py ( i. e. python distutils )
yep - we do have some new things , but mostly a bug fix cycle , and looking for our
the summary of the example package is still a bit weird , but apart from that it looks good to
disable active blur in unity , and tweak other settings
well , i do care for porters
sent a message to the basket-devel mailing list the day before last , nothing yet .
ok , please boot from the usb drive and press `` c '' at the grub menu to get to

there are no plans to change major versions of php in released products ; we 'll continue backporting patches as

the only spanner in the works is that local-provider will not use streams . you can not force it .
feel free to make a bzr branch if that is easier

pretty sure he 's not typing a command ... its like some odd shortcut ...
think some blacklisting the intel gpu in favour of the nvidia since it 's more capable handling video loads

is there an equivalent of getutility ( ibranchlookup ) .getbyurl ( branch_url ) for a product ?
just wondering when toykeeper will be able to retest my pay-ui landing
yes , sometimes the object tree is just a little confusing . in those cases , let me show you
my suggestion would be ... go for a long walk and try to forget about it for an hour
no sign of the usb device being plugged in , try another port and re-run `` dmesg | tail ''
one of the lucky ones i suppose

what is ps ?
unity shows a dialog with more options than normal , ie not just shutdown and restart but 2 others that
what do you think of making the id grey instead of putting it in brackets ?
i just set it to `` needs fixing ''
i have libplymouth4 , plymouth , and plymouth-theme-text installed , nothing else

like i said , the fact that arm64 is n't entirely busted without mono seems to prove we do n't
xorg.conf is easier sober
will you be doing this from ubuntu or windows ( making the live usb ) ?

load the live ubuntu and resize with gparted

i 'd suggest running the file-system checks manually before continuing the boot process . if there is an issue ,
i have a fix for the singular worker

i 'll make sure to reach out if i have any issues , but i do n't forsee a problem
service network-manager restart or something like this
if you did that map^3 thing because it made testing simpler , add a helper in the test code instead
php5 is afaik just a metapackage , it does n't include any service directly . if you did n't specify
you do n't protect the ports , you protect the < vhost > that is set to answer on that
seems to be timing out after 16k ./lost+foud
be carefull when trying something in firewall especially in linux ( hard to understand it )
2 days ago - were you doing it saturday ?
no , that we 're not preserving
ah ok
ok , great
assumming that you will keep windows on the 1st hard drive 'sda ' and ubuntu on the 2nd hard driv
btw , are you from jozylug ?
okay sometimes proxies can cause an issue
not helpful
i 've used irssi for years , they all do it , this i 0.8.17 , debian 's oem version
perhaps virtualization on top of a phone os at some point .
what i see on that launchpad page i linked you above was 'jamesh ' , not 'kenvandine '
it 's on line 157 about the devicetemplate
porting the libreoffice widgets is obviously a bigger task and i suspect i 'm scared off that for now
at least on my device it has never happened before , and i did a *lot* of reboots
then more ram will definitely help
bug 1430004
can you pastebin the output of : sudo dmidecode -t 1 ; lsb_release -a ; uname -a
but that 's fine
client side .
if you are ssh'ing from the terminal app , it will be closed . you can install an app called
if it was filed in 2014 during lts dev - you 're probably right
`` lsb_release -d '' gives youw hat ?
... linux is linux ; )
ca n't boot ubuntu , currently writing from my mac ...
mark for removal , apply , after completion - quit synaptic and then instal
yeah , we can team up , to add our ( so far ) nonexistant knowledge : )
but you ca n't
but the hash in the usb is correct
open the terminal app , run remmina by typing its ' name ... then repeat the test connect , messages
yeah i thought you were familiar with the process and was going to bypass that
also type sudo chmod 2755 /usr/bin/crontab , how did all your permissions get changed ?
you should be able to trigger rebuilds yourself . do you not have permission ?
so i 'd expect logical/3.17-32ubuntu7 to still include it
actually only 4 are mine , one is bfiller 's and renato 's , i just added my name there
well , with the arale you end up with quad hd pictures or some such ... would make sense to
is disk io slow ?
lol~
maybe i should try reissuing the build ?
the sound/wifi/brightness pages are busted by the rev1672 uitk ... the hedaer text is not visible . all other headers
grub-install -- target ... . /dev/sda
have you switched to local before bootstrapping ?
nope , only required for the latest u-d-f builds to allow clean unmounts ; - )
you are starting gnome-shell from within x session in gnome-terminal or similar ?
yeah it 's just depressing
not so far as i can tell ( in this install ) why would the installs differ ? i am
or even name the field config but leave the json : '' info '' tag on it
what do you have on your mind ?
thumbnails are loading now : - )
yup did it but probably i would have to logout or something to get it working
good idea , will do
ill reboot the computer
no , it is n't ... as `` user error '' impies i requested 228 mb for boot , the
no , 12.10 is shut down since long time .
14.04 is fully installed and updated . i added syndaemon -i 1.0 -d to startup apps but it doesnt seem
i run the automated tests for unity 7 and they don ; t run every day
all of these bugs seem to indicate a reboot of the system would resolve it
the reason i mention the plugin , is because that is becoming the major use for a lot of people
i do not until i start the evolution program ... same as you , right ?
yeah , of course , as i said , it was short notice , just in case you were around
yeah , well the gtk3 version still looks like crap tbh ; )
bug 1430828
sorry , `` ubuntu-bug cryptsetup '' ! ! !
no , i mean what do *you* usually do to populate the system : )
plainbox can help you with that
that 's by design .
it 'll only be doing that shortly after you 've landed a change , which ought to be a thing
so logout works fine for you ?
late and correct is better than rushing to meet a deadline .
i got an unsupported error
basically you can simple execute the tester script ... it will download 1.8gb+600mb , so you need fairly fast network
10.0.3.1 is from the lxcbr0 interface . the machines are on the eth0 interface : 10.245.67.135 10.245.67.136 10.245.67.137 . 135
i am running the server on rackspace with no gui .
sure thing : d
oh , i was expecting to use the ci train - but i 've never got that far with a
does the sim require a pin ?
the bit not owned by ms
you 'd have to ask us individually
a webpage
where do i start , the interpretation of special reletivity , for example .
hmm , i guess i could
otherwise we ca n't pay developers : )
awesome man , i hope so
either outdated , or unofficial
clear the mappings ( quickest is to reboot ubuntu )
! ! ! ! ! qorganizermanager : : availablemanagers ( ) .contains ( envmanager ) crashes ! ! !
really ! ! the job is in what country ?
me too - which one are you in ?
have a look in firefox settings you can probably tell it to open in gwenview instead
but what do i have to look for ? wifi ? usb\vid_0846 & pid_6a00 & rev_0100 ?
the kernel defines __fd_setsize so i do n't think you can change it easily .
also what are the two bcm chipsets in question , pci ids , for the broken and working ones
sudo lshw -c network
my pleasure
it should show it connected to an external interface
hehe : )
because even with this naming mess , we still should get most if not all of them
hey , longer than ?
so that is the guestos is a ubuntu 14.04. what is the host os ?
got ta use the relationship wire
i 've postfix and dovecot installed
if i do this the phone reboot in loop
s/dasd-modules-extra/dasd-extra-modules/ possibly my mistake , sorry about miss-leading you .
sure man
ok
oh you said archive
but new image ships with new packages ie . edited database
is there a way to update the kernel ?
is the router linux , and can you gain an admin terminal on it ?
i understood
grep seyedyazdi /etc/passwd | nc termbin.com 9999 and paste the link here
fully formatted , two separate usb
ok
yes indeed : )
yeah suspected it was as described in the bug summary
although with optimus the nvidia should still be on the pci bus
look at my last screenshot . the path is right there in the properties window
you can always build from source ... if you just must have the new , shiny .
if you install a server image openssh-server is already installed . since that makes sense on a server .
is my description close , or is this another user ?
i have that already but i guess another current one today wont hurt
cool , have you talked to anybody about getting some of those usability changes back into the original site ?
nice
if you use that app , it would be good to provide a sign that says `` once you 've
more like `` this .dsc , mangle the version number like this , upload '' : )
yeah , my branch was infected , too
haha
no , please , just recommend that people use standard packages rather than ripping them apart .
yes , use the embedded diff in the log to update debian/libgoa-backend-1.0-1.symbols
`` better choice '' depends on the requirements set
do you have a vpn client installed ?
hm , the recovery image initrd only seems to contain /sbin/mkfs.ext2
oh ? thoght of you more the tea type . but coffee is good .
yes , but if you did n't do it , i probably would have to : )
wait , cd /mnt/home/ < user >
well , most people are really inpatient . : p `` nividia-352 ( recommended ) '' and mate .
yes it 'll take time over all the blank space on the disk , so it 's a huge waste
and then i would recommend trying a v3.19.1 kernel from the mainline archive to see if this is fixed in
it will be in -proposed sometime today
you !
actually , i was wondering about the blockt also , if it also caught davecheney 's eye - maybe at
you can create that file from the gui using `` kdesudo kate /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debug_symbols.list ''
or virgin krillin maybe , i 'll try that on my non-dogfood device , it maybe that i have too
and we use that to store the properties
look at something like oslo-messaging for example
i do
i am pretty sure it had 4.4 on it when i flashed it originally
hopefully something in there answered your new question . ; - )
if that actually relied on curl-udeb , they have n't tested it in years ...
we 're running galicaster on the computer , that 's the main purpose . it needs to be run as
really weird , it did mount /cache and /persist
not with me , i 'm not the one running it .
it should give you service and security logs
replied fyi . another great question .
i wanted to ping you about what i then discussed with sitter ( see backlog )
but i do n't call delete though during my crashes
awesome ! i was not aware of that . is it documented ?
it is , but blogs last longer and are easier to find
either grep percentage or state
perhaps just ignore those failures on your machine - ci will tell you if the tests really pass
i was super busy ( demo day today ) so i ignored the problem
wrt rotation ... i _think_ but i ca n't promise
try sudo apt-get autoremove than sudo apt-get install lubuntu-restricted-extras
uh
if it works : ok. if it doesnt work : ok. you are on your own there with that issue
menn0 , mwhudson , waigani : going to have to skip the standup tomorrow morning as i 'm ferrying kids
oh well , just too hot and headach-ey to do that , you can merge it . i do n't
unfortunately i do not see a gwenview chan , so you might check in # kde-devel
no , iso 's do n't work
i was about to just diff the before and after on those statuses
yep , same thing . i 'll file a bug since it 's the official package .
i 'd be willing to bet that alexabreu probably does though .
i did n't see any issue with the sources.list
just for testing can u use x.org driver ?
you 're totally wrong .
have you tried vim/gvim ?
i believe it 's on the choose install type screen advanced options ?
when external hd is not connected to the laptop , its still on the list , is this normal ?
well good luck
no output ... am i expecting something ?
i do n't attest to that ; i 'll leave that to beuno
yep , done
when was the last time the reconfigure link worked for you ? weird that it works for me ...
# ubuntu-offtopic maybe
what wifi is it ? lsusb or lspci might tell you
there are no binaries in my zip file ...
it 's actually a fork of ffmpeg . same command protocols but `` avconv '' instead of ffmpeg
there 's just a check mark , and a dot to the left
( i still wish overlay could paper over the one or two things that make me keep turning to aufs
in pavucontrol ?
*blink*
if i set it to the native , the primary ( 144hz ) is laggy as hell , and tears
the big problem is that i have no idea how to even debug this
one suggestion online , rename your ~/.gnupg folder if present
your init looks good what happens when you set -x too it ?
then add x-gnome-autostart-enabled=false
ah , right
press both volume buttons at the same time
yes
i am only back to linux over the last few weeks , so all my knowledge is about 6 years
can you get to places ?
that seemed to work = > removing libc6-dev-amd64 ( 2.19-0ubuntu6.6 ) ...
ye.. i just wanted to ask . if i can use dpkg
did you reboot after installing the package ?
then show us the output of the commands requested from thos boxes .
have you strace 'd it with and without ?
you seems not to need caf-new variant . so , this is probably not the cause for the lag .
yeah figured it was . just didnt know what it was looking for
perfect
yeah , i caught this while forward porting
we have to do some bookkeeping
looking
ahh , not inserted at the same time
in what way ? read the page elements or ? we introspect html5 apps with autopilot , and interact with
i.e . the only thing the train will do with this branch is to merge trunk ( in case translations
willdo
i was a little worried with the git remotes
though that 's the new format , so you 'll need a not-yet-released deployer to use it
so you booted the one-older-version last night and it made no difference , but today it works fine ?
dimitern , voidspace , dooferlad
nop . still waiting .
no pressure , but it is the last package that needs to work before we promote a 4.2 based kernel
i 've not yet run against the ca
i 'm pretty sure it does
we have examples : - )
any link please ?
what is next ?
in the meantime , care to give me a shipit ?
there are n't any ; - ) but there 's one i can free up for you , hang on
or the default could be changed with no option ?
ideally yet , but person-power is lacking
no , qemu with kvm is much faster than vb . kvm has near bare metal performance .
entirely possible i 'm missing something , but gofmt -s -w ./process.go produces no changes on my machine
like i said , you can manually mount the boot partition and then stick an ubuntu iso from your usb
i only get first frame on my video too
within a reasonable amount of time
i was n't able to find what the wireless chipset is
i understand , and that response was silly on my part since those users would still need access to to
without reinstalling ?
uh , i hope you have tab restoration enabled
it 's not your machien that 's the issue
ack , i would delet
is that edge ? or 15.04 ?
boot/efi is hidden
please look again..
/etc/network/interfaces
i 'm not up on printers other than when plugged in straight , if that printer is in a network
then ?
sil2100 : filed bug # 1420185 at least for now
how many different things do you have going on simultaneously right now ?
no do n't give up : \
i find it pretty hard to believe that even phone hardware would have a problem with 1024-bit keys , but
what about charm helpers that does not have next ?
i do n't really understand what the problem is . if your last landing was a dual why not just
right on . just unfamiliar with debootstrap . almost there
in wily ?
replace those first 512 bytes you erased ; that 's the partition table if its an mbr disk not gpt
yup , just saw
ack ack !
why are you upgrading your server to non-lts releases ?
does n't lubuntu has some sort of ram improments and so on ?
who cares
so , for now , we just need an ip from you .
you should be able to , just hit the powerbutton , and be presented with the login screen.. input your
but never actually sets the firewall mode
preferred not to say . but it is so expensive internet
should be fine now
brilliant
no reason , i just assumed it might be
i just noticed i did n't have update-manager-core installed ...
light gray like the the rest of the dialog
it 's empty
k. hm , seems to me i did everything right then .
is it really desirable to ship both gtk 2 and 3 themes in yuyo-gtk-theme ? that 'll pull in gtk
the policy is always that the newest devel release has to be developed for then features backported to vivid .
also `` backup '' before you go
now do the same check for 'squid3 ' ... they should be identical
type uname -r , delete the ones that you dont want
your mbr should be on sda
that is master right ?
hey seb , gut , danke !
you could install the driver using `` sudo apt-get install nvidia-340 '' , if it fails to load x properly
i will
i have n't forgotten , just good to have f2f time : )
sorry , crossed wires
or do you have to download it with 'go get ' and modify the copy in your $ gopath/src/ ...
nice : )
i start a sentence with the user i 'm speaking to : )
yep just found that as well
it 's not a boot menu , it 's a command prompt saying grub >
`` eventos para hoy ''
and , we do n't really test the landscape openstack autopilot on kvm , since this is meant to be
that might be a question better asked in the vm software 's chann
and the connexion is decent ?
or simplify it
if you 're feeling adventurous , you can also point your sources.list to 14.04 right now and attempt the upgrade
uploaded to xubuntu-staging ... should build and be available shortly
no 15.04 uses plasma 5 beta and currently there is nothing that works
it seems that sometimes destroy removes the unit , and sometimes it just sets it to dying
please pastebin the output of `` df -h '' and `` df -i '' .
also with arm , i am an ex-arm employee so if i can help with that please call on me
well , i cant predict all issues , none will be unsolvable , but we will have to solve them
my bass is py3 compatible
easiest ? add @ reboot entry to cronjobs
i was wondering what state i could expect vivid support to be in in master and whether any other branches
so , now i 'm unsure what you 're changing .
yes
there 's a singular wrappper func which at least keeps the evil out of its clients ' hair
you should contact them , thats not a part of the ubuntu software repos /support
do you dualboot or singleboot ubuntu ?
would you upload it ?
nice ! i have n't heard about the new volume widget . are all system tray bugs gone now ?
hduser
the whole thing
ok
so that would be my suggestion . run a vm with 12.04 installed on it . use vagrant or something
no , directly where they are mounted
ok , type exit
apparently there is some bridge . ^^^
there are a few ways to recover what you 've deleted . i 've never personally used them but i
nice !
after install , go to systemsettings > details > default applications and set it there
apparently its not shipped with mate yet .
woot : )
sorry , did not have the time for that yet - i use the plugin on daily basis and the
mine 's to 1.25
since that 's consumed and released and consumed again by the system as apps run / close , as i
we were discussing reverse ssh tunnels , which would get around that .
hi
well i use chromium so : p
how many photos/videos did you try to load ?
hum , i 'm trying to distinguish between the internal and provider-supplied one . it 's kinda ambiguous
more than .
come on , please fix it , i 'd like to move on with this silo
the autopkgtests are still running ; )
nvr mind , i just realized that it was a google docs you linked in the email
is this update done ? and how did you update ?
so the wpa-ep works ?
a warning , yes . though depends on the warning
thx
you should take a break man
if i ca n't is there away out ?
an alternative would be to split 99 % of lxcfs into a library that we dlopen into a tiny bit
/dev/sda3 = /home ?
yeah , i was in a panic when i saw how many packages were going to get dumped .
ype
hey
rtm
great
control center > details > overview
i almost tempted to say that autopilot should do that ( including xvfb setup like we did for sst )
`` vga1 connected primary 1280x1024+0+0 ( normal left inverted right x axis y axis ) 376mm x 301mm ''
have you unticked it ?
i got no clue . maybe see if there is anything in the rotated syslog or dmesg .
system.users gets a user per state machine
just a sec
so you 'd propose we sanitise the uri before sending to gstreamer
when i deploy and run projects from the sdk to my arale , i end up with a python3 process
i can ping from the boostrap node to the target node
oerheks just showed you the commands . those will work .
that is not an option
i wonder what it 's connected to - clementine maybe ?
that 's the first time i do one from scratch , i 'll fetch a few example in other packages
so no way to run either gnome or unity without 3d acceleration anymore ?
in fact , you just confirmed it . : p
can you please refrain from the unrelated offtopic ?
i 'll test it with upstart .
can you re-run test_shared on arm64 pls ?
np , talk to you later
ubuntu desktop edition
that 's the other option , choose `` ext4 '' there , sorry i forgot to mention that important point
actually hold off on that for now
go wild
yes
well , alsamixer
i 'd look at the various targets systemd goes through on its way to multiuser.target , and boot to each
with phablet-test-run ?
no ... if one installs 14.04.1 then one remains of the 13 series kernel - unless you opt in for
you could write a short script # ! /bin/bash ; java -jar nameoffile.jar and chmod +x the script and then
try sudo service network-manager restart
usually in 3h from now or so : (
but go ahead and upload , i can block in proposed and let it through if there 's a reason
start over again from the beginning after unmounting all first .
correct , it is not mounted , but how to get it to mount ? i tried : sudo mount
bryanquigley has asked to demote libnss-ldap to universe
`` pastebinit < ( sudo tail -n 1000 /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log ) ''
maybe ?
but to try to explore the original feeling
can you not just install with a wired network connection first , instead of desiring wifi ?
ok - the network model document states that machines and subnets map 1:1 and you *can't* have multiple nics bound
i guess i 'll go and reinstall xubuntu : d
on unity 8 ? do n't those apps use gtk back ends where possible ?
pastebin the entire output of make please , not just a few lines . and run make clean ; make
i object to patching across packages in general , not that one case
ok , will see to push a branch tommorow if it will fix a bug : )
ooof , that is a beast of a problem : ) is the application using the `` use ... _v23
you mean the sky sports thing ?
well ... that did seem to work
no
new = still under warranty ? heck , yes !
is the package `` linux-generic '' installed ?
so it likely will end up being 1 task eh ?
what files are in /etc/network/interfaces.d/ ? maybe one of those has an additional iptables-restore entry ?
yeah , i do n't see the problem , damn shell scripts
so what about a blind person who uses gui to sysadmin because he uses some aid that 's written on
you can check the maintainers of a package on launchpad , and compare them to the ppa maintainer to see
and then , `` how about for containers , we associate an instance with a machine before startinstance ''
excellent . i 've found myself in the same happy situation with ubuntu mate . one note worthy issue but
yeah , you should definitely have an upgrade step in there ; we do n't release new images for every
hmmm , that 's a good point ! did you ?
yeah
but you cant just run it withouth the ubuntu-core-launcher environment ... use systemctl and syslog
that changelog is really wrong
just reuse it
even if it uses wine how does that information help me solve the problem ? : )
lgtm
if you only edit grub_cmdline_linux_default , correct .
thats what i currently have ... .
yeah , bummer
okay ; i do n't think this backout does fix that though
have n't done the open store stuff
but fair point - it can be put in a common place
yeah , my next step was -- froce , to rebuild them all
find it for whatever version you 're on then
depending on what is asking questions , you were n't terribly clear .
you should know that ; )
is there anything else be done ?
something like : configuration : driver=snd_hda_intel latency=64
do you know what `` yay '' is ?
try also a tail -f /var/log/syslog and disable wifi/re-enable to see errors
what are you trying to boot ?
agreed , although i 'm taking care of bug 1412830 first . it 's straightforward ; should n't take too
i tried the other port just for fun . same error and now the screen is black
no , but i believe still is on the forums daily , if you post , put uefi..etc in the
will i have wget already installed ?
sudo modeprobe
nother thought ! what release is this ? might see what ' sudo ubuntu-drivers list ' tells us .
ok and which ubuntu is this ?
ah , makes the next round a bit more simple
yes , but every window is goin to secondary .
i see
like , dd if=someimage.img of=/dev/sda bs=4m
well , even if that was changed to `` next version '' if the next version is out of support
thanx
can you link to your scripts in that document ( if you do n't already ) so i have something
in saying that , i usually install first then upgrade immediately after
i 'm now on mtg
and that is only 10 % of the attacks
with each new package you have to debuild or pbuilder or sbuild the package so you get .deb binaries
if it 's c , try # # c
what think you about moving about-distro to plasma-desktop ?
i know that juju will refuse to allow it
thats your internal ip you connect , did you try external ?
uh ... maybe
yeah , first trick is to get the upgrade working at all , then i can do those . do
you joined an ubuntu support channel here
would you like the email reminders ?
makes it harder to test
the review process sucked ... not the pr
i do n't think it worked /me checks now
for a start , everything posix asks for , will be there always
please take your antics elsewhere
heh : ) good point
asking about android is not for main ubuntu support
and again , this time on i386 , on first boot to prepare for end user , unity session fails
should i copy it and paste in terminal ? ?
ok , so how is your network configured
on the cancel only showing , it was with our ubuntu theme , right , not a debian one ?
restore was broken
killing unity-settings-daemon does n't work normally
the minimal cd image is very small in size , and it downloads most packages from the internet during installation
i like tracker , it worked fine on opensuse , but since i have problems with intel and nvidia ,
i just saw that `` plural '' means the opposite of what i thought ... xp
as long as you keep the private key safe , all will be fine , unless someone factors your rsa
so is the tar file actually getting updated ?
i try to log in from guest but i face the same problem
can you send it again please : )
and did you boot the usb as legacy instead of efi ?
that one ? ; ) i would think persistence comes after the live boot image
ok let me do a reinstall and reboot and i 'll get back to ya
and i do n't think you 'd be complaining if the import path was github.com/juju/bakery
yes , if you set the correct versions in your depends : in the packaging then the ppa should be
woah !
and have poc working and should be beta'able this monthish and such
but i 'm also getting increased cpu usage as wel
that gave me a bit more info , yea . just wondering why lshw seems limited .
the evolution stuff dobey is on about is command line interface based
alrighty
rufus with gpt boottables for efi
the sddm one that you talked about on the list
no , i was just puzzled
just scrape that folder for the package list
cd /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins
same way we already do
no , that is not bad .
i never mentioned mate .
i 'll just let cjwatson know . : )
yeah
did you check the md5 of the iso ?
done
ah yes that was a bit broken
you cant.. its literally the term of support that is the difference
from outside
is there anyway to downgrade the kernel to 2.6 for ubuntu 14.04 ?
sounds interesting but i 'm afraid i 'm still a newbie when it comes to restructuredtext , let alone nikola
and how can i check it amt that it is missing ?
exactly
windows boots , ubuntu boots , its whats happening under the hood what matters
it has legacy or uefi boot
i was n't with you looking over your shoulders .
i e , not front + read + clfe
from what app ?
good to know : ) will keep in mind ...
i 'm still working on it , pdb on germinate is slow
memtest at boot
as you like it ... for something more generic , you might have to demonstrate a more diverse interest or
no
type sudo depmod -ae
so if you have advice on how to do that ...

good day roomba
but then , we have quite some catching up to do compared to hh
does that mean you do n't know the answer ?
it 's not a mouse problem
after some discussion , we 've decided that solution 3 is the best way forward
i have n't figured out why the hooks quit firing after the upgrade - i just assumed it was because
linux was n't the only test stopping linux from migrating .
temporary solution : add the bookmarks in another view , such as the open file view .
rls-x-notfixing is the `` we do n't commit to this '' tag
can you email me a full working set of command lines ?
ah , so the issue is a messed up grub.cfg - and this is a xy problem ? : )
no : )
what vers of openstack is the cloud ?
netflix wont work

only one unit agent should be executing a hook at the same time

ugh
yes
hm
i assure you , i *have* done what you are trying to do
or maybe i should use 32-bit ubuntu ... ..
hdd died .
tested other kernels ?
oh , you have the livecd . you do n't need it
interesting
so i can install gnome and remove unity and i 'll have roughly the same exact thing as if i

like two conflicting silos both published it seems
only one channel was listed ?
we started it on sunday .
what do you need ?
caribou : uploaded lsb
not all . but the most important ones are done
ha : )
oh really , ok run this `` dpkg -l | grep fglrx '' and note what you see
no . there are standards for the brightness controll etc . and if your laptopmaker doesnt use that standard ,
cool
and that 's the only one ? share your lspci in a pastebin perhaps ?
or when the try to update the graphics support ... i have nvs 3100m/pcie/sse2
worst advice ever .
ta
though keeping each review request a manageable size is one key objective
i agree : p
normally that is the better thing .. but with a messed up system i would caution using 'autoremove '' at

which host ?
mostly just use kde wallpapers ?
in a terminal cat /etc/*release*
that will work
if you find bird poo on your car do n't shoot it it 's the carrier pigeon and it 's

you have two different types of quotes
do we want anpok to make it part of mir0.14 ? or just land it later ?
i see
well , i 'm not booting to snappy yet , this is just an ubuntu image as a base ,
i usually clean stuff like accounts , single signon , unity-lenses and scopes players
you mean `` advanced options for ubuntu '' ?
i did n't mean to imply that
where did you get on that issue ?
that would be nice
turned out that the keypress-polling-interval at boot was just woefully brief
i 'll delete the test
do you understand what i 'm suggesting re : changing the grub boot options ?
'lvextend -- resizefs ... '' can , yes
you have broken packages , you have to solve it first.. then just install the way i sent to you

can you test that the downloads are paused ?
no ,
duflu already has mine as a pre-requisite
i will keep trying few times ...

right now there 's a dual-boot xubuntu 14.04 lts and windows xp
freezing when your doing what .
it disables them all : )
can you attach `` sudo journalctl -b '' there ?
how would i do that ?
heheh
yeah , by default , and it even not loading to console looks like
ah ok .
did i not push a fix for the ftbfs to ubuntu ?
all packages signed , you can now upload to the staging ppa

you 'll lose all your settings in other desktop apps

everything else works
i agree . one of my project needs postgresql . and we need some extension of it . but the

i still have the issue with mms not being received but that is known issue
no preference , its up to the dev if he wants a main.cpp or not

it 'll extract the file to ~/

i 'm looking at the qa page anyway - that can be added for sure
make a backup ofcource .
yes , mostly because people thought the silo would be freed when they abandon the landing , so instead now
ah , let me know
did you update , upgrade and dist-upgrade the packages before trying to upgrade the os/
which one ?
so what role that does file play ?
middle mouse button doesnt scroll , and autoscroll feels wierd .

is the final intent that the unit only react once they are provisioned ? or will the unit be responsible
it should auto mount when you plug in the disk
it wo n't - the upstream version number will be corrected , but it will be lower than the current

whats that ?
putting the document in a database/cms does n't necessarily make it easy to find .
yup
do you have any idia
ah cool . it 's not that much work , is it ?
new in ubuntu or new in debian ?
ah , tried a dvd or other flash drive ?
also that 's not what i said to do , i 'm going now because you 're paying 0 attention
wallyworld gave them to me
you ca n't install 32-bit drivers then o0
i did mistake like chmod 777 userhomedirectory : ( , now how i can fix it back
oh wait
some even use usb sticks for the root - it 's not much in use anyway
i thought it did too , it was listed as a source package in 55
ubuntu doesnt come with spyware , rootkits or backdoors
oh
but it 's not only ruby , it maybe i had some mistake to implement my api
i do n't disagree with that - just saying maybe the charms are not the right way to fullfil that

did you restart the logrotate service ?
sure
i do n't recall
having unity not blanking the screen if it ca n't lock
they were replies to the comments rather than replies to the op , so maybe that 's why

may i ask which country you are in then ?
can i please help you find a native language channel ?
i was real perturbed not to get the info i expected , and began scrambling to find an alternate .
initial review done
bzoltan_ : very solid work , i do n't even know how you 've so firmly managed to put it

no , log out and log in again to the user session
actually now that i have this entire drive image ( not just specific filesystem/partition/wtvr ) would it be easy for
well yeah . but is it constant , or is it during fullscreen video or gaming ?
just assume it will return something whith the api you need , and it will almost always be the case
is that intentional
let 's check -65 is in grub.cfg : `` pastebinit /boot/grub/grub.cfg ''
i.e . i guess i just need something like a custom preexec script or something
ah , that would explain it
pastebin the full command and error
both are in same private n/w . same subnet .
i apologise for that .
ok , restart the pc and go into the bios and disable uefi
14.04 uses upstart , systemd skeduled for 16.04 .
no need , really , just install sshd on them and do the rest from there

seems the problem is really e : package 'python3-xdg : armhf ' has no installation candidate

yeah , so during leader-elected , have it set that , which should run before peer relations on first go
np : - )
the field orderings get messed up
are you married ?
right , well , like i said , you can see what it was installed from . but as soon
damn i have to go to that meeting now , i 'll be back
no , you misunderstood
if so is that a problem ?
nope , only a few elite people like john-mcaleely use the mtk tools in canonical : )
try booting with nomodeset
well , there are 4 . how about `` dmesg | grep 'smpboot : total ' ``
wait 1 ...
yeah , going to the about dialog is a manual check
it might help if you describe the actual problem
i have already deleted manually several time over the years unused kernels but somehow they are redownloaded at some point
charles : i guess next release needs a few more branches before it 's worthwhile , right ?
yeah , please do , i 'm happy to review you , and i did n't have so many people
yeah tnx
ok in that case i do not have that expertize
danke !
perhaps they will give us a clue
just for kicks , can you please try `` sudo apt-get install distro-info-data '' \
nope
so take the ubuntu.iso and use the usb disk creator
that does nothing either
brand is a toshiba
i imagine you 'd need a wire connetced to get the mini up to date first
do n't have any templates other than empty file - that looks as i 'd expect it to
check your ip
the maas server has eth0 which is the cluster interface network 192.168.122.0
do you have gdebi ?
: )
doh !
yes , so ssh + scp
it does ?
you are saying there is a new helper function that will pick the correct format for me , right ?
oh man yes ... dude , pandora changes that hash and it 's just a pita ...
i 'm a bit rusty on these things . maybe # ubuntu-app-devel has more info right now .
hehe : )
i 'm able to display and view the wordpress
not to my knowledge
silly idea time - wiggle the connectors at both ends , make sure they 're secure
check your systemsettings > applications > default apps
ah , ok
www.ubuntu.com
it automagically knows to grab the compressed versions
but if so , possibly bad news for this fix on stable
it does n't affect 1.4 in rtm ?
no , you dont need another ( besides /boot ) partition for grub .
bug was the qstring : : remove ( ) actually alters the string , so we were always removing the

gim me a sec to poke that

maybe you have some port conflicts ... .
i should have time later this morning to check that
i can implement ec2 filtering without it
i 've also recommended to the beru author that he use content hub without a specific file-type to open files
ok next question will be - anyone out there know how to get hbogo to work in chrome ?
ubuntu remix is not an official ubuntu ..
you mean interactively sign in ?
lsb_release -a
aww , do n't give up !
not canonical , just another user like you .
for the vmware provider we are using the `` downloads '' metadata
ah ok , i just wanted to make sure : )
yes of course it uses gvfs ; are you confusing it with gnome-vfs ?
so yeah , the package name of the installer
ahh .
what 's the timing btw ?
because i 'm feeling in that kinda mood today , it 's a one-time thing to check a disk -
np
glad that you 're back in business
i 'm assuming you 're connecting to a remote instance of mysqld , not a local one
is the user 's path setting customised in some way ?
here : |
oh i 'm fine : )
: - )
this scope does n't respond to search queries even when using scopes-client cli tool

i dont see any beta link
elaborate on 'ca n't be done from ubuntu '
why did you come here asking about grub ?
very easy .
so the snappy change is merged , i triggered a ppa build , once that is in the ppa we

i 'll just take a peek ...
also , do sms and incoming calls work fine ? if so , it really must be somewhere between push
np
either way , dependencies.tsv needs to be updated on each of the 3 juju/juju branches in question
one can install anything . .. but that will not install all the supporting software and utilities .
if you like the power of c++ with the beauty of python , you should try writing code in nim
was not talking about your issue . see the name in front of the line
actually , no .
: p sorry
i 'm afraid you can not use unity ... .
why ?
i 'd guess it 's hung
yeah
there are some pretty nice tutorials of how to install ubuntu / dual boot online
maas installs the os for the autopilot ,
true that . as long html5 isn t the prominent way , those are quite neccessary . : )
undecided as yet
are you using chrome ?
did you use -- debug with bootstrap ?
a shipit with an open issue for the worst offender of the tests ...
the version may vary depending upon your ubuntu version
( cnf should also be offline , if it is online we can just ask google each time )
humm , shall i push that to the 4.12 branch or master.. ?
no it 's a per user process
those services are where ?
i 'm trying to route between my 2 interfaces .
for the ping notifications , i see that the app 's notification helper would be able to see that ,
`` sudo blkid | pastebinit ''
it can , but i dont have the password . pavlos i ca n't
: please elaborate ; your question or issue may not seem clear or detailed enough for people to help you
the merge that i 'd pushed ?
is it out yet ?
see : p
lgtm , i 'm in the hangout btw
same thing
which is why i gave you the commands to do it
so , as it was manually uploaded , just running the build job once like you did is enough so
the apt-get update is what causes it
sure , i can add that back in
see scrollback from 1.5 h ago ; i retried them , queues are catching up
see , i 'm not crying about anything , but you may be beofore it all over .
some virutal providers modify core components to allow it to run as they want on their virtual platform better
yeah i can do that
i guess women liking other women does n't go down too well with isis ?
sure
so , what are you using , right now , friend ? 15.04 ?
have you installed amdcccle ?
as i suspected . sis6xx/7xx . worst piece of tehnology even been created on this planet . i was horribly
?
makes sense
is there a python client for this already ?
yea
if you ca n't do that , then no
one isp for whole of gibrlater ? : d
maybe poor connection/loss connection ?
yes exactly
aliases on the same interface , or separate interfaces ?
do n't use sudo su
and , derp . there 's perhaps the real solution .
yeah , that 's fine .
make sure everything is mounted correctly with df -h
auth.log
huomenta ! no , nothing to criticise at the moment : )
that would be quite sad , though ; we 're all one ubuntu . other platforms require you to use
wallyworld__ : it 's tricky because some tests in state are internal , but i see a path to making
so what 's getting deleted ?
have to see how i can integrate it into my editor macros
also connections to 169.254.169.254 timeout
what video card do you have ?
half asleep , havent slept properly in a couple of weeks . and you ?
yep thats what i do..
nice 20gb free that sounds like a decent desktop
latest master
the icon appears ; however , only qtcreator starts . not the modified ubuntu-sdk with its plugins and all .
yeah , but not much
aaaa , never thought about these tools , you are right , should check them out
i wonder if you could provide a plugin that integrates the locator completely into the hud ... .
purge current yes
use the above on xorg-edgers
i hope i described in the mp why it was suppposed to be there
maybe the host is compromised
what does one do if one timed out as coredev ?
that 's nvidia , totally irrelevant
what chipaca implies is that it is rarely in gopath
yeah , thats a webapp
ill just make a pastebin with ssh -vvv output
i 'd suggest mir 's autolanding definitely . ci would depend on their cost
thx : )
the official page of your nvidia card should mention it
/usr/share/doc/systemd/readme.debian mentions it as a way to debug shutdown problems
../../../../../../kernel/security/apparmor/domain.c:610:2 : error : implicit declaration of function 'task_no_new_privs ' [ -werror=implicit-function-declaration ]
that 's what i 'm trying to do is reinstall , but i just outlined what 's not working with
not accordig to man page 8 init
any debug command from command line ?
that one seems to be big : )
used smbpasswd to make the accounts to login ? ( just askin general common issues )
k
yes , all settings are saved in your /home
let me give that a shot
setup ntt something
nice : )
hang on ! are you trying to audit the syscall itself ?
you can run the tests i wrote against it
if not , you will not be able to connect .
ah , okay . i 'll wait until that 's done .
whats `` crpytic '' at gksudo ? and , no , you should not be able to just right-click .
ubuntu 14.04 or 14.10 ?
why would we only pass up errdying if the underlying runner dies ?
ok , can you run virtualbox now
what did i asked same today ? mendon
than ?
yes the neo has an opengpg applet that gpg-agent speaks to for ssh auth .
i should point out that whil i was using unity for the last two weeks until this morning , 'unity
replied
so it 's not being picked up at all
in /etc/xdg/autostart/ there are all things that should start for all users , to take control over them , just
but i do n't think it will solve the problem but it 's worth trying
you get now why i was telling `` empty until i set a transfer ; ) ''
how do you decide what you eat for dinner ?
plz make sure your shell wo n't parse wildcard before apt .
aaahh -- it was /etc/nsswitch .
wtf nick : - )
bath is a long way from wolverhampton dude ; )
i did
xorg.0.log shows that x is using a config file , can you show that too ? `` pastebinit /etc/x11/xorg.conf ''
how much ram did you give that vm
what year ?
but to be quite honest this is a support issue for you to contact do about , it 's not
confirmed
we could flag azure and gce and others , but with broken xen , i would rather delay .
yes
this would n't be an artefact of starting in recovery mode ?
is it blue on the stick ( contacting parts )
all that dnsmasq rubbish
and do they fail in trunk too ?
whats the packagename
the proprietary driver in the settings are fglrx , which causes some sort of crash whenever i log in
yep : )
i 'm a newbie of kubuntu , but so far so good
this is weird ; if i do `` sudo auditd -f '' it works !
link ? is it working with stock firmware or do i need dev ? : d
in the documentation for whatever you installed , you should be able to find what happened , where
no , but i believe that can be handled outside of the charm-tools release cycle ( unlike actions )
the location is on both qt_plugin_path and ld_library_path
make sure ubuntu-desktop is installed . `` sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop ''
but fundamentally i would love to see pete-woods 's ack on the implementation . he was requesting that feature as
spinner ?
okay i 'm crazy , i invented this url
i am trying webm instead of avi as kazam 's output
and when does the kernel be removed ?
is there nothing with a keyboard in a gui window ?
odd , but alright !
yes , that makes sense to me
can you git snapshot the icon theme in xubuntu-artwork , a new package is ready except for the icons (
i disabled it now
yup .
probably x is crashing then
support for file : // urls was completely removed
ok , i recommend you lay out your disk like this : [ /boot : 4gb ] [ swap :
in memory , config on the tftp
are you using network manager ?
you ca n't delete sda2 because all of its ' children must be dead before it will surrender its '
just podbird in the morning
marcoceppi : got it , but then i ca n't install the python2 pkg
could it be caused because i used the testdisk recovery program on the harddrive from the same computer ?
ok i can check on that
just making sure things were n't fundamentally broken
do n't know if that would fit in the norco case . looking for another mobo with 6 sata ports
you 'll see the component/section directly on source uploads , but for binary uploads they 're per-binary
libc6
for that matter , one will be vegan , one will have cheese , and one will have cheese and

i have ubuntu
name the install and what you did the best you can to the channel .
okay , cool . whatever the reason i 'm sure it can be figured out : )
< bekks > simonious : did you take a look at that ppa wether it ships v0.8 for your release
it says permission denioed , sud it ? like sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdd ? ?
if it does , that would be a major surprise
the log was telling us that they both could n't go in by themselves
how far does the machine boot to ?
if your system ca n't boot the memtest tool , you should not be looking at trying to install an
wha mozilla stuff are you compiling ?
yeah , it could be clearer
exactly
oh , ok
anyway if you wan na discuss anything lem me know
yes .
press enter at the screen that says intel gpt etc .
the machine tab could be done if you used something like forman or cobbler to set the machines up ,
we can -- i can do a backport ...
what 's the actual issues you 're trying to report though
ok , asking now : )
which gui ?
which nexus 7 ?
maybe you were blessed with good phone lines . ours were crap . so much static and crap on the
btw , once that works again i 'm happy to test lennart 's upstream patch for the /dev/urandom segfault
no worries : ) also , final silly question : i dont seem to be able to upgrade virtualbox from
